#use wml::debian::translation-check translation="1.4"

# Hello translator people!!
#
# This file just includes the data and definition files for the real content.
# For you to make search.<yourlang>.html put this file in 
# webwml/<yourlang>searchtmpl and edit webwml/english/searchtmpl/search.def
# doing the usual slices thing.
# You may need to create the searchtmpl directory and edit the top-level
# Makefile.
# Of course edit the blurb below (in your language directory) to suit.
# Email debian-www@lists.debian.org if you want to understand how this
# horror works.

#include "../../english/searchtmpl/search.data"

<P>At long last the Debian website has a working search page.  Most of the
site is indexed though you may want to look at more specific search pages
for <A href="http://packages.debian.org/">packages</A>, 
<A href="http://lists.debian.org/search.html">mailing list archives</A> or
<A href="http://bugs.debian.org/">bugs</A>.

<P>Currently languages that use dual-byte character set cannot be indexed,
we are working on a solution for this problem.
