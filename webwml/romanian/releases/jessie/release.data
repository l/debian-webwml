### While jessie is stable, we can reuse the tags defined in
#### templates/debian/release_images.wml.
#### When the website gets prepared for the next stable release,
#### the tags should be defined here instead (see previous releases
#### for examples).
#### Note that images for the new oldstable release will be moved to
#### cdimage/archive at the time of the release!
#
### Next line should be changed to 'wml::debian::installer' when
### preparing for next stable release; don't forget the Makefile!
#use wml::debian::release_images
