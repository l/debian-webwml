# Note: iso-8859-2 does not contain "U+0218", i.e. Latin S with comma below,
#       nor Latin t with comma below.  Instead, iso-8859-2 contains
#       S with cedilla (for Turkish) and t with cedilla (for nobody).
#       Iso-8859-16 have support for s and t with comma below.
#       Just waiting for the fonts with this encoding. :-)
#       (Even though the Monotype Arial font actually uses the
#       "t with comma below" glyph.  :-)
#       So, every time the fonts are regenerated, it is best if some
#       manual editing be done so that a comma can be seen clearly.  :-)
