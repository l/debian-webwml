# The '-q' forces wml to be quiet. Very useful in scripts.
# It is sometimes useful to add '--epilog=weblint' to check for errors
# in the html generated.
# Other languages may want to change the wml command to execute programs
# that get run before or after wml. For example,
#    WML="wml -q --prolog="/usr/bin/tcs <options here>" \
#                --epilog="/usr/bin/tcs <options here>"
WML=wml -q --prolog="/usr/bin/kcc -e" \
           --epilog="/usr/bin/kcc -j > $(@D)/$(@F)" \
           -o $(@F)

# The following was included here simply because it was convenient
