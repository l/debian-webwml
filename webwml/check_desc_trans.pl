# Check translation status for mailing list descriptions. Since these files
# aren't WML files, the translation data is stored in a separate file in
# each directory, listing the names of the files and the corresponding
# English version.
#
# Since I couldn't figure out how to add this to the regular check_trans.pl
# script, this is a separate script.
#
# To use this script, create a file called translation-check in each
# directory under <language>/MailingLists/desc/. In it you list the name of
# the translated file and the version of the English original, separated by
# whitespace. Then run this script, and it will tell you about which files
# are missing, which files are outdated, and if there are files translating
# files that are no longer in the English directory.
#
# There are no command line parameters.
