<h1>Debian-PowerPC History</h1>

<p>
 The PowerPC port started in 1997 after the German <a
 href="http://www.linux-kongress.de/">Linux-Kongreﬂ</a> in
 W&uuml;rzburg where the Debian project was sponsored a <a
 href="http://www.infodrom.north.de/Infodrom/tervola.html">PowerPC</a>
 for development issues.
</p>

<p>
 Fortunately working boot- and rootdisks were found at <a
 href="http://www.linuxppc.org/">LinuxPPC</a> and we could try to
 install something on the machine.  Unfortunately this required
 some programs that only run under MacOS.  The only way to install
 them was to get another machine running MacOS who has them already
 installed.  Since data exchange with other non-MacOS machines were
 only able through msdos-formatted floppies this was a chicken-and-egg
 problem.
</p>

<p>
 Somehow we managed to hook another disk to the machine and
 installed Linux on it.  That was Apple's famous DR 1.  Suddenly we
 begun to port dpkg and friends to the new system.  Wow, that was
 possible.  It was impressive how the first packages were ported
 and built.  Unfortunately DR one didn't come with a dynamic linker
 and shared libraries.  Another problem was that the libraries and
 header files seemed to be somewhat outdated and we weren't able to
 compile a new libc out of the box.  However, the biggest and most
 serious problem were these suspicious crashes that also screwed
 the file systems entirely.  Fixeable only by re-installations. 
</p>

<p>
 Klee Dienes, another Debian Developer, worked on this problem and
 suddenly came up with a <a
 href="ftp://ftp.infodrom.north.de/pub/Linux/linux-pmac/debian/mklinuxfs.tar.gz">mklinux tarball</a>
 of a more recent system - a haxored Debian GNU/Linux.  This
 tarball came with an old 1.99 version of libc.  From this time the
 machine run stable on the network and we could continue our
 effort.  We were compiling a lot of packages and noticed that some
 header files were not proper and that many programs were not
 compilable by the regular compiler.
</p>

<p>
 So Joel Klecker, a new Debian Developer at that time, started to
 work on egcs and it's compilation on the PowerPC machine.  After
 this was done the next step was to work on current libc versions.
 It turned out that our libc-1.99 version is incompatible to the next
 pre2.1 version that was needed in order to move the port into a
 stable state.
</p>

<p>
 At this stage Hartmut Koptein switched over from m68k to the powerpc
 port and started development for it. Hopefully Debian/PowerPC will be available
 at the end of 1998 or to the beginning of 1999.
</p> 

<p>
 Today there are at least five PowerPC machines where Debian
 GNU/Linux is running and developed on.  Most of the machines are
 already converted to use the newer libc version and regular
 re-compilation of packages has been started.
