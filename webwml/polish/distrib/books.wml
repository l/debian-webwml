	<email ganten@uni-bremen.de>
	<cd-included 2 editions: One with no CD, the other with Official CD (i386, contrib and sources)>

<br>
The book covers all steps of planing and installing Debian GNU/Linux on 
PC based hardware, including important applications like the X Window
System, window-managers and desktop-environments (KDE, GNOME) and a great
selection of important system services. UNIX/Linux basics and concepts together
with system-usage and important components (bash, system-services and important
commands) will be introduced.
<br>
There will be an explanation of Debian's package format and how to
create packages in this format. Also an overview about standard Linux
applications  (Networking, Software Development, LaTex and Office Packages) will
be given. Strong emphasis will be on networking and system administration
issues, like the planing and building of a dial-in router or a server for
windows based clients (SAMBA). Overall, the book will cover important Linux
concepts to make it possible  -even for Linux beginners with low computer
knowledge- to get started with Debian GNU/Linux. For experienced users and
professionals the book will be of great help when setting up a system and
solving new problems.

  <title Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage>
  <author John Goerzen and Ossama Othman>

  Debian isn't as intuitively obvious as some other operating systems, like
  Windows 95. GNU/Linux is like a race car, a master chef's kitchen, or a
  classic novel; its power and complexity make it difficult to approach at
  first, but far more rewarding in the long run. This book, in conjunction
  with the software, makes a reader comfortable with the concepts and
  confident enough to start using the operating system with proficiency. 
  <br>
  Released under the General Public License (GPL), Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to
  Installation and Usage contains the full Debian GNU/Linux distribution
  direct from the Debian Organization. This book was published with the
  support of the Debian organization and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). A
  portion of the proceeds from the book is being donated to the FSF.

  This is a book that will help all the people new to Debian (and even to Linux)
  get off the ground. Experienced folks will also learn a few things! The
  authors have tried to cover what most people need to know to install,
  configure, run and administer Debian. They have tried to make this the most
  complete, thorough and in-depth reference to Debian Linux...and I think they
  have achieved it. From the newest newbie to the experienced guru, whether you
  manage a huge network of Linux machines or just want to install it on your
  desktop at home, you're sure to find something of interest in this book.
