La Espiral (http://laespiral.org/) is a project
meant to promote the use of Debian amongst the
people who speak Spanish. We work on custom
Debian internationalisation CDs, do installation
parties and new programs for Spanish users (see
http://www.debian.org/international/spanish/).
.
Becoming a member of La Espiral is for people
that do not find themselves able to contribute
technically to Debian (at first), but might be a
good step towards becoming a Debian developer.
