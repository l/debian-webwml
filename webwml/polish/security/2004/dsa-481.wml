<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several serious problems have been discovered in the Linux kernel.
This update takes care of Linux 2.4.17 for the IA-64 architecture.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems that will be fixed with this update:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0003">CAN-2004-0003</a>

    <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the R128 DRI driver in the Linux
    kernel which could potentially lead an attacker to gain
    unauthorised privileges.  Alan Cox and Thomas Biege developed a
    correction for this.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0010">CAN-2004-0010</a>

    <p>Arjan van de Ven discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
    ncp_lookup function for ncpfs in the Linux kernel, which could
    lead an attacker to gain unauthorised privileges.  Petr Vandrovec
    developed a correction for this.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0109">CAN-2004-0109</a>

    <p>zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in the
    ISO9660 filesystem component of Linux kernel which could be abused
    by an attacker to gain unauthorised root access.  Sebastian
    Krahmer and Ernie Petrides developed a correction for this.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0177">CAN-2004-0177</a>

    <p>Solar Designer discovered an information leak in the ext3 code of
    Linux.  In a worst case an attacker could read sensitive data such
    as cryptographic keys which would otherwise never hit disk media.
    Theodore Ts'o developed a correction for this.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0178">CAN-2004-0178</a>

    <p>Andreas Kies discovered a denial of service condition in the Sound
    Blaster driver in Linux.  He also developed a correction for this.</p>

</ul>

<p>These problems are also fixed by upstream in Linux 2.4.26 and will be
fixed in Linux 2.6.6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 011226.17 for Linux 2.4.17.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.25-5 for Linux 2.4.25 and in version 2.6.5-1 for Linux
2.6.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages immediately, either
with a Debian provided kernel or with a self compiled one.</p>
