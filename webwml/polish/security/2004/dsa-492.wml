<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Herbert Xu reported that local users could cause a denial of service
against iproute, a set of tools for controlling networking in Linux
kernels.  iproute uses the netlink interface to communicate with the
kernel, but failed to verify that the messages it received came from
the kernel (rather than from other user processes).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 20010824-8woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your iproute package.</p>
