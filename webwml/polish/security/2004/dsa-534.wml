<define-tag description>directory traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A directory traversal vulnerability was discovered in mailreader
whereby remote attackers could view arbitrary files with the
privileges of the nph-mr.cgi process (by default, www-data) via
relative paths and a null byte in the configLanguage parameter.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.3.29-5woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mailreader package.</p>
