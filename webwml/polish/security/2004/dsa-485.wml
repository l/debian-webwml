<define-tag description>format string</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered two format string vulnerabilities in ssmtp, a
simple mail transport agent.  Untrusted values in the functions die()
and log_event() were passed to printf-like functions as format
strings.  These vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited by a
remote mail relay to gain the privileges of the ssmtp process
(including potentially root).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem will be fixed
in version 2.50.6.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your ssmtp package.</p>
