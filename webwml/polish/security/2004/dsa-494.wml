<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jack &lt;<email "jack@rapturesecurity.org">&gt; discovered a buffer overflow in
ident2, an implementation of the ident protocol (RFC1413), where a
buffer in the child_service function was slightly too small to hold
all of the data which could be written into it.  This vulnerability
could be exploited by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
the privileges of the ident2 daemon (by default, the "identd" user).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.03-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your ident2 package.</p>
