<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple format string vulnerabilities were discovered in neon, an
HTTP and WebDAV client library.  These vulnerabilities could
potentially be exploited by a malicious WebDAV server to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using libneon.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 0.19.3-2woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.24.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your neon package.</p>
