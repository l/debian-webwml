<define-tag description>cookie path traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in KDE where the path restrictions on
cookies could be bypassed using encoded relative path components
(e.g., "/../").  This means that a cookie which should only be sent by
the browser to an application running at /app1, the browser could
inadvertently include it with a request sent to /app2 on the same
server.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in kdelibs version 4:2.2.2-6woody3 and kdelibs-crypto version
4:2.2.2-13.woody.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem was fixed in kdelibs
version 4:3.1.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your kdelibs and kdelibs-crypto packages.</p>
