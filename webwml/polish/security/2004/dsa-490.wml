<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the index support of the
ZCatalog plug-in in Zope, an open source web application server.  A

call arbitrary methods of catalog indexes.  The vulnerability also
allows untrusted code to do the same.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.1-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0-0.1 and higher.</p>
