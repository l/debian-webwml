<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in php4:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0594">CAN-2004-0594</a>
   <p>The memory_limit functionality in PHP 4.x up to
   4.3.7, and 5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, under certain conditions such as
   when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to
   execute arbitrary code by triggering a memory_limit abort during
   execution of the zend_hash_init function and overwriting a
   HashTable destructor pointer before the initialization of key data
   structures is complete.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0595">CAN-2004-0595</a>
   <p>The strip_tags function in PHP 4.x up to 4.3.7, and
   5.x up to 5.0.0RC3, does not filter null (\0) characters within tag
   names when restricting input to allowed tags, which allows
   dangerous tags to be processed by web browsers such as Internet
   Explorer and Safari, which ignore null characters and facilitate
   the exploitation of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.1.2-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.3.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your php4 package.</p>
