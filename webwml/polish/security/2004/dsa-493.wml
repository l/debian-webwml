<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in the Socks-5 proxy code of
XChat, an IRC client for X similar to AmIRC.  This allows an attacker
to execute arbitrary code on the users' machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.9-0woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xchat and related packages.</p>
