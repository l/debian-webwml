<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Christian Jaeger reported a bug in logcheck which could potentially be
exploited by a local user to overwrite files with root privileges.
logcheck utilized a temporary directory under /var/tmp without taking
security precautions.  While this directory is created when logcheck
is installed, and while it exists there is no vulnerability, if at
any time this directory is removed, the potential for exploitation exists.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.1.1-13.1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-13.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your logcheck package.</p>
