<p><strong>Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 has been superseded by
<a href="../../lenny/">Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (<q>lenny</q>)</a>. Some of these
installation images may no longer be available, or may no longer work, and

<h1>Installing Debian GNU/Linux <q>etch-and-a-half</q></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The <q>etch-and-a-half</q> release is essentially just the most recent
point release for etch, but with a more recent kernel (version 2.6.24).
The main purpose of this release is to allow installation of <q>etch</q>
on systems not supported by the 2.6.18 kernel that is used in regular
<q>etch</q> installs.
</p>

<p>
For further details about scope, purpose and limitations of the
<q>etch-and-a-half</q> release, see the
<a href="../etchnhalf">Release Notes</a>.
</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>
For new installations of <q>etch-and-a-half</q> the current release of
<em>Debian Installer for <strong>lenny</strong></em> is used, with minor
changes for compatibility with <q>etch</q>.
</p>

<p>
Please read the notes below carefully before installing <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Because the current <q>lenny</q> installer is an RC release, it
	    may have some errata you would not expect in a stable release.
	    See the <a href="#errata">errata section</a> at the bottom of this
	    page for details.</li>
	<li>The <q>lenny</q> installer includes a number of changes from the
	    <q>etch</q> installer. See the release announcements for the
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2008/20080317">beta1</a>,
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2008/20080609">beta2</a>, 
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2008/20081112">RC1</a> and
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2009/20090131">RC2</a>
	    releases of the installer for an overview of changes.</li>
	<li>This includes changes that affect preseeding (automated
	    installations). See the appendix on preseeding in the Installation
	    Guide for <q>lenny</q> (linked below) for correct preseeding options.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following installation options are available to install Debian GNU/Linux
<q>etch-and-a-half</q>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>netinst CD image</strong> (generally 135-175 MB)
	<ul>
	<li>Only available for selected architectures.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	<li>Can optionally be used in combination with images from the
	    <a href="index">current full CD/DVD set for <q>etch</q></a>.
	    After the installation of the base system, the installer will ask
	    if additional CDs should be scanned; at that point insert CD1 or
	    DVD1, or the KDE or Xfce CDs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-netinst-images /></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>businesscard CD image</strong> (generally 20-50 MB)
	<ul>
	<li>Available for all architectures.</li>
	<li>Needs to be booted with the option '<tt>suite=etch</tt>' to
	    install <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-businesscard-images /></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>netboot images</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Available for all architectures.</li>
	<li>Needs to be booted with the option '<tt>suite=etch</tt>' to
	    install <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	<li>Other images than netboot (usb stick, floppy) may be usable,
	    but have not been tested.</li>
	<li>Images for subarchitectures that will be supported in <q>lenny</q>
	    but are not supported in <q>etch</q>, may not be usable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-other-images /></p>
    </li>

<p>
<strong>Additional notes</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	The current <q>etch-and-a-half</q> installation images based on
	Debian Installer Lenny RC1 use a newer kernel (2.6.26) than the
	version that was included in the <q>etch-and-a-half</q> release
	and is installed for the target system (2.6.24). In some cases this
	can mean that hardware which is supported during the installation
	does not work after the reboot into the installed system because
	support for it was added after the 2.6.24 version.
    </li><li>
	If any of the hardware in your system requires firmware to be loaded
	with the device driver, the installer may ask if it should load the
	firmware from a removable medium, such as a floppy disk or USB stick.
	General information about loading firmware during an installation can
	be found in the Installation Guide (see	Documentation below).
    </li><li>
	For the netinst and businesscard CD images, <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> and
	<tt>SHA1SUMS</tt> files	are available from the same directory as the
	images.
    </li><li>
	There are two reasons the netinst image is only available for selected
	architectures. First, a lot of architectures don't really have new
	hardware that is not supported by the 2.6.18 kernel. Second, some
	architectures are most commonly installed using netboot, making the CD
	image unnecessary.
    </li>
</ul>
