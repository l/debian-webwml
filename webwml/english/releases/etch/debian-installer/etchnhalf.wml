<h1>Installing Debian GNU/Linux <q>etch-and-a-half</q></h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
The <q>etch-and-a-half</q> release is essentially just the most recent point
release for etch, but with a more recent kernel (version 2.6.24). The main
purpose of this release is to allow installation of etch on systems not
supported by the 2.6.18 kernel that is used in regular etch installs.
</p>

<p>
For further details about scope, purpose and limitations of the
<q>etch-and-a-half</q> release, see the
<a href="../etchnhalf">Release Notes</a>.
</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>
For new installations of <q>etch-and-a-half</q> the current release of
<em>Debian Installer for <strong>lenny</strong></em> is used, with minor
changes for compatibility with etch.
</p>

<p>
Please read the notes below carefully before installing <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Because the current lenny installer is a beta release, it may
	    have some errata you would not expect in a stable release.
	    See the <a href="#errata">errata section</a> at the bottom of this
	    page for details.</li>
	<li>The lenny installer includes a number of changes from the etch
	    installer. See the release announcements for the
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2008/20080317">beta1</a> and
	    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2008/20080609">beta2</a>
	    releases of the installer for an overview of changes.</li>
	<li>This includes changes that affect preseeding (automated
	    installations). See the appendix on preseeding in the Installation
	    Guide for lenny (linked below) for correct preseeding options.</li>
</ul>

<p>
The following installation options are available to install Debian GNU/Linux
<q>etch-and-a-half</q>.
</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>netinst CD image</strong> (generally 135-175 MB)
	<ul>
	<li>Only available for selected architectures.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install etch.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	<li>Can optionally be used in combination with images from the
	    <a href="index">current full CD/DVD set for etch</a>.
	    After the installation of the base system, the installer will ask
	    if additional CDs should be scanned; at that point insert CD1 or
	    DVD1, or the KDE or Xfce CDs.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-netinst-images /></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>businesscard CD image</strong> (generally 20-50 MB)
	<ul>
	<li>Available for all architectures.</li>
	<li>Needs to be booted with the option '<tt>suite=etch</tt>' to
	    install <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-businesscard-images /></p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>netboot images</strong>
	<ul>
	<li>Available for all architectures.</li>
	<li>Needs to be booted with the option '<tt>suite=etch</tt>' to
	    install <q>etch-and-a-half</q>.</li>
	<li>Will automatically install the 2.6.24 kernel.</li>
	<li>Other images than netboot (usb stick, floppy) may be usable,
	    but have not been tested.</li>
	<li>Images for subarchitectures that will be supported in lenny but
	    are not supported in etch, may not be usable.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Images: <etchnhalf-other-images /></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Additional notes</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	For the netinst and businesscard CD images, <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> and
	<tt>SHA1SUMS</tt> files	are available from the same directory as the
	images.
    </li><li>
	There are two reasons the netinst image is only available for selected
	architectures. First, a lot of architectures don't really have new
	hardware that is not supported by the 2.6.18 kernel. Second, some
	architectures are most commonly installed using netboot, making the CD
	image unnecessary.
    </li>
</ul>
