<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	The multi-arch <em>CD</em> images support i386/amd64/powerpc and
	alpha/hppa/ia64 respectively; the installation is similar to installing
	from a single architecture netinst image.
    </li><li>
	The multi-arch <em>DVD</em> image supports i386/amd64/powerpc; the
	installation is similar to installing from a single architecture full
	CD image; the DVD also includes the source for all included packages.
    </li><li>
	For the netinst and businesscard CD images, <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> and
	<tt>SHA1SUMS</tt> files	are available from the same directory as the
	images.
    </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="errata">Errata</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the installer shipped with 
Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_etch>. If you have experienced a problem
installing Debian and do not see your problem listed here, please send us an 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem or 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/BrokenThings">check the wiki</a>
for other known problems.
</p>

<h3 id="errata-r0">Errata for release 4.0r0</h3>

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Disk devices may change on reboot</dt>
	<dd>
	On systems with multiple disk controllers, the kernel/udev may assign
	a different device node on reboot of the system than was used during
	installation due to difference in load order of drivers.<br />
	This can lead to failure to boot the system. In most cases this can be
	corrected by changing the bootloader configuration and /etc/fstab,
	possibly using the rescue mode of the installer.<br />
	Note however that this problem may occur again on subsequent boots.
	Fixing this issue has priority for the next release of Debian installer.
	</dd>

	<dt>Resizing of existing ext3 partitions may fail</dt>
	<dd>
	The installer is currently not able to resize ext3 partitions that have
	the <tt>dir_index</tt> and/or <tt>resize_inode</tt> features enabled.
	This includes ext3 partitions created with the Etch installer.<br />
	You can however manually resize an ext3 partition during installation.
	Proceed until the partitioning step, use the &lt;Go Back&gt; button to
	exit to the main menu, start a shell, and resize the file system and
	partition using the commands available in the shell (<tt>fsck.ext3</tt>,
	<tt>resize2fs</tt> and e.g. <tt>fdisk</tt> or <tt>parted</tt>). If you
	start partman again after completing the resize operation, it should
	show the new size of the partition.
	</dd>

	<dt>Incomplete installation of Desktop task from full CD</dt>
	<dd>
	The full CD image is too small to contain all packages needed to
	install the complete Desktop task. This means that if you only use the
	CD as a source, only part of the Desktop task will be installed.<br />
	You can resolve this either <em>during the installation</em> by choosing
	to use a network mirror as a source to install packages in addition to the
	CD (not recommended if you don't have a decent internet connection), or
	<em>after you have rebooted</em> into the installed system by using
	<tt>apt-cdrom</tt> to load additional CDs and then selecting the Desktop
	task again in <tt>aptitude</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>

	<dt>General issues after reboot because of UTF-8 default</dt>
	<dd>
	The installed system is now set to UTF-8 by default. However, not all
	applications properly support UTF-8 yet, which may result in minor or
	major problems when using them.<br />
	Please check if such problems have been reported yet and, if not, file
	a bug report against the relevant package (not the installer).
	</dd>

	<dt>Limited localization of installed system</dt>
	<dd>
	For the Sarge version of the installer the package localization-config was
	responsible for part of the localization of the installed system. This
	package ran as part of base-config, which has been dropped in the release.
	Adapting localization-config to run before the reboot is on our TODO list,
	but meanwhile some localization may not be done automatically when
	installing in languages other than English.
	</dd>

	<dt>Installation of Sarge not supported</dt>
	<dd>
	As a result of some structural changes in the installer, installation of
	Sarge (oldstable) is not supported.
	</dd>

	<dt>Graphical installer</dt>
	<dd>
	The graphical installer still has some known issues (see also the
	Installation Guide):
	<ul>
		<li>some non-US keymaps are not fully supported (deadkeys and
		    combining characters do not work)</li>
		<li>touchpads should work, but support may not be optimal; if you
		    experience problems, you should use an external mouse instead</li>
		<li>limited support for creating encrypted partitions</li>
		<li>should work on almost all PowerPC systems that have an ATI
		    graphics card, but is unlikely to work on other PowerPC
		    systems</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>Network driver sky2 known to be broken</dt>
	<dd>
	The sky2 network driver is known to be broken in the kernel
	(2.6.18.dfsg.1-11) used in the installer and may cause kernel panics. See
	for example <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/404107">#404107</a>.
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/411115">#411115</a> contains a series of
	patches that may fix the issues.
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>
-->

	<dt>i386/amd64: serial console setup with GRUB</dt>
	<dd>
	There are some issues with the way the installer tries to setup GRUB
	to use a serial console. Full details can be found in the bug report
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/416310">#416310</a>.
	Briefly, these issues can be resolved by ensuring that the parity and
	bits options are also passed in the <q><tt>console=</tt></q> definition.<br />
	For most people	this will mean that instead of booting the installer
	with <q><tt>console=ttyS0,9600</tt></q> you should use
	<q><tt>console=ttyS0,9600n8</tt></q>.
	</dd>

	<dt>i386: booting the installer may fail on some older systems</dt>
	<dd>
	Due to a regression in the syslinux bootloader used for most installer
	images, some older systems may fail to boot the installer. If the boot
	halts after displaying <q><tt>Loading initrd.gz....</tt></q>, you
	should try one of the
	<a href="http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/pub/etch/syslinux/">alternative
	images</a> that use an older version of syslinux. See also bug report
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/415992">#415992</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>amd64: formatting an ext2 file system is not possible</dt>
	<dd>
	Because the ext2 kernel module is not available, it is not possible
	to create an ext2 file system. This will be fixed with the next update
	of the installer for Etch.
	</dd>

	<dt>powerpc: various issues</dt>
	<dd>
	The PowerPC port has several issues in this release:
	<ul>
		<li>installation from floppy on OldWorld PowerMac is broken
		    because no device node is created for the swim3 module
		    and as miboot is not included</li>
		<li>the snd-powermac module is no longer loaded by default as
		    it will lock up some systems; you will need to add it to
		    <tt>/etc/modules</tt> manually</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: CD installs for sparc32 may fail</dt>
	<dd>
	The esp kernel driver module is broken which means that installation from
	CD-ROM is broken for most sparc32 systems. We suggest you use the <q>netboot</q>
	installation method instead.
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: installer appears to hang during boot</dt>
	<dd>
	There are two situations where the installer may appear to hang during
	boot after displaying <q><tt>Booting Linux...</tt></q>. The first is when
	there are two graphics controllers present (this is also described in the
	<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/etch/sparc/ch05s03.html.en#sparc-boot-problems">installation guide</a>).
	The second is due to a bug in the kernel's ATI framebuffer driver and
	affects only certain ATI graphics cards.<br />
	In both cases the issue can be worked around by adding the parameter
	<tt>video=atyfb:off</tt> when booting the installer.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
		<li>support for LCS network interfaces is no longer available</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Improved versions of the installation system are being developed
for the next Debian release, and can also be used to install etch.
