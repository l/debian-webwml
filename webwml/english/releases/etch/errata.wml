<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the

dists/etch-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.</p>

the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 4.0 point release
  deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian proposed-updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
