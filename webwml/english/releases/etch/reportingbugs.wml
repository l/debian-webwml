<h2><a name="report-release">With the Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>Errors in the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a> should be
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">reported as bug</a> against the
pseudo-package <tt>release-notes</tt>. Discussion of that document is
coordinated through the debian-doc mailinglist at
<a href="mailto:debian-doc@lists.debian.org">\
&lt;debian-doc@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>. If you have issues with the document
which aren't appropriate for a bug you should probably mail the list instead.

<h2><a name="report-installation">With the installation</a></h2>

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report

<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">report template</a> 
to ensure you include all the necessary information.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the
<a href="installmanual">Installation Guide</a>, you should
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">file these
as bugs</a> against <tt>installation-guide</tt>, which is the source package
in which that documentation is maintained. 

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list,
<a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">\

how to submit upgrade reports, please read the 
<a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="report-package">Any other issues</a></h2>
