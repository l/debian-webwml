released <current_release_date_etch>. The release included many major

<if-stable-release release="lenny">

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there may be some problems that exist in the
release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can always

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
