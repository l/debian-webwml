#use wml::debian::template title="Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 -- Reporting Problems" BARETITLE=true

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt> package.  Information you
should submit with your report is discussed in the
<a href="i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-troubleshooting">Installation
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the
<a href="installmanual">Installation Manual</a>, you should also file those
as bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.</p>

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list,
<a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">\
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and file a bug against that
package.</p>

<p>For information on how to file bugs, see the 
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking web page</a>.</p>
