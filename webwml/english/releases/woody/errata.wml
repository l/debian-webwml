<p>See the <a

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
dists/woody-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 3.0 point release
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian proposed-updates main contrib non-free
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US proposed-updates/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="diskcontroller">Unofficial support for disk controllers not detected by the installer</toc-add-entry>

<p>A few systems with RAID controllers like Adaptec-2400A are not supported
by the default installer. You can still install Debian 3.0, using the bf2.4
flavor and preloading driver modules from this
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~blade/install/preload/">floppy disk</a>.</p>
