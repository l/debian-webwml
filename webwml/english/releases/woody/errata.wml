<h2>Security issues</h2>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `woody'.</p>

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ woody/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>


<h2>Point releases</h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.</p>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
dists/woody-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 3.0 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Unofficial support for disk controllers not detected by the installer</h2>
<p>A few systems with RAID controllers like Adaptec-2400A are not supported
by the default installer. You can still install Debian 3.0, using the bf2.4
flavor and preloading driver modules from this
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~blade/install/preload/">floppy disk</a>.</p>
