<h2>Woody is On the Way</h2>

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  This release will be
numbered ``3.0''.</p>

<p>This distribution is currently in the
``<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">testing</a>'' phase,
but stabilizing and close to being
``<a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives.html#s-frozen">frozen</a>''.</p>

<p>The potato installation system is no longer being actively maintained,
and we recommend using the woody installer for new installations, even
though it is not available on CD yet. The new <a href="installmanual">\
installation manual</a> and the <a href="releasenotes">release notes</a>
are available for preview.</p>

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".</p>

<p>People often ask if there is a single release "progress meter".
Unfortunately there isn't one, but we can refer you to several places
that describe things needed to be done for the release to happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">Release-critical bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://base.debian.net/">Base system bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://standard.debian.net/">Bugs in standard and task packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://bugs.debian.net/">Other bugs and bug squashing party notes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, general status reports are posted by the release manager
to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/">\
debian-devel-announce mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases, include GLibC
2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.1 and Perl 5.6. Linux kernel 2.4 is also going
to be provided as an option, but it is judged not to be mature enough
to be a default for most architectures at this time.
KDE 2.2 is also going to be included.

<p>As far as changes specific to Debian go, some of the highlights include
being able to select the version of the kernel to boot with the installation
system when booting from a CD, availability of new packaging system front
ends such as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/aptitude.html">\
aptitude</a> or <a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/admin/synaptic.html">\
synaptic</a>, and it's also likely that the <code>debconf</code> package
will be used in nearly all the packages which need to prompt in the
maintainer scripts.</p>

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access packages in
<em>testing</em>:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.</p>
