#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``woody'' Release Information" BARETITLE="true"

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  It is likely that this
release will be numbered either ``2.3'' or ``3.0''.

<p>This distribution is currently considered ``unstable''. That means that
things <em>will</em> break if you run it. Anyone running unstable is
expected to be informed about any volatilities, usually by following
developer-oriented mailing lists.

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".

<p>We have decided to completely gut boot-floppies, replacing it with a
new installer suite. Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases,
include Linux kernel 2.4, GLibC 2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.0 and Perl 5.6.
It's also likely that the <code>debconf</code> package will be made
obligatory for any packages which need to prompt in the maintainer scripts.
