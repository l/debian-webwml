<h2>Woody is On the Way</h2>

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  This release will be
numbered ``3.0''.</p>

<p>This distribution is currently in the
``<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">testing</a>'' phase,
but stabilizing and close to being
``<a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives.html#s-frozen">frozen</a>''.</p>

<p>The potato installation system is no longer being actively maintained,
and we recommend using the woody installer for new installations, even
though it is not available on CD yet. The new <a href="installmanual">\
installation manual</a> and the <a href="releasenotes">release notes</a>
are available for preview.</p>

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".</p>

<p>Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases, include GLibC
2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.1 and Perl 5.6. Linux kernel 2.4 is also going
to be provided as an option, but it is judged not to be mature enough
to be a default for most architectures at this time. It's also likely
that the <code>debconf</code> package
will be used in nearly all the packages which need to prompt in the
maintainer scripts.</p>

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access packages in
<em>testing</em>:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.</p>
