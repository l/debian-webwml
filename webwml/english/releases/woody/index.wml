<h1>Woody Cometh</h1>

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  This release will be
numbered ``3.0''. Please note, some of the links in this document are
not complete yet.

<p>This distribution is currently in ``<a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">testing</a>'' phase, but
stabilizing and close to being ``frozen''. The potato installation
system is no longer being actively maintained, and for new
installations the woody installer is recommended, although it is not
available on cd just yet. 

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".

<p>Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases, include GLibC
2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.0 and Perl 5.6. Linux kernel 2.4 is judged not
to be mature enough for most architectures at this time, although you
can always try your luck with a 2.4 kernel after completing your
installation. It's also likely that the <code>debconf</code> package
will be used in nearly all the packages which need to prompt in the
maintainer scripts.

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access packages in
testing:

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.

<a href="$(HOME)/News/2001/FixMe">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/">Distribution
page</a> for more information on getting Debian.</p>

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new in Debian 3.0, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:</p>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released
also contain instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.</p>

for the <:= $arches{'i386'} :>, <:= $arches{'alpha'} :>,

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for woody as they become available.</p>

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual,
however some parts of it still need work. This particularly applies to some of the
non-English translations. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list. You can browse the documentation sources (which are in
DebianDoc SGML) via the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">CVSweb
interface</a> or check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.</p>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `woody'.</p>

<h3>Point releases</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.</p>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
dists/woody-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Internationalized Installation Support</h3>

<p>An internationalized version of the installation system for i386 is <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/current-i18n/">available</a> for
testing and use.  You need to use the 'idepci' or 'compact' flavors.</p>

<h3>Unofficial ReiserFS Support</h3>

<p>There seem to be at least two unofficial versions of the
installation system for i386 supporting ReiserFS.</p>

<p>One version is from John H. Robinson, IV, and is available with
some instructions at <a
href="http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/">
http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/</a>.</p>

<p>The other is from Marc A. Volovic and is available at <a
href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/">
http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/</a>.</p>


<h3>Unofficial Linux Kernel 2.4 Support</h3>

<p>
Adrian Bunk has provided a set of packages for i386 Potato systems
which provide compatibility for Linux Kernel 2.4.x.  Please read <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">
http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html</a> for instructions,
warnings, and lines to add to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="reporting-bugs">Reporting Problems</a></h2>

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt> package.  Information you
should submit with your report is discussed in the <a
href="i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-troubleshooting">Installation
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the <a
href="#new-inst">Installation Manual</a>, you should also file those
as bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.</p>

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list, <a
href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and file a bug against that
package.</p>

<p>For information on how to file bugs, see the 
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking web page</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="credits">Credits (or Blame)</a></h2>

<h3>Installation System</h3>

<p>Many Debian developers, translators, documenters, testers, and
users have contributed to the development of the installation system
-- too many to mention, in fact. Adam Di Carlo was the maintainer of
the boot-floppies during the period of the Woody release.  Other
significant contributors can be found in the <code>Maintainers</code>
file of the <code>boot-floppies</code> package.</p>

<h3>The rest of Debian</h3>
