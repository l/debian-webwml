<h1>Woody Cometh</h1>

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  This release will be
numbered ``3.0''. Please note, some of the links in this document are
not complete yet.

<p>This distribution is currently in ``<a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">testing</a>'' phase, but
stabilizing and close to being ``frozen''. The potato installation
system is no longer being actively maintained, and we recommend using
the woody installer for new installations, even though it is not
available on CD yet.

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".

<p>Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases, include GLibC
2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.1 and Perl 5.6. Linux kernel 2.4 is judged not
to be mature enough to be a default for most architectures at this time,
but you can install a 2.4 kernel from Debian after completing your
installation. It's also likely that the <code>debconf</code> package
will be used in nearly all the packages which need to prompt in the
maintainer scripts.

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access packages in
testing:

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.

<a href="$(HOME)/News/2001/FixMe">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/">Distribution
page</a> for more information on getting Debian.</p>

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new in Debian 3.0, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:</p>

<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released
also contain instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.</p>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for woody as they become available.</p>

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual,
however some parts of it still need work. This particularly applies to some of the
non-English translations. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list. You can browse the documentation sources (which are in
DebianDoc SGML) via the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">CVSweb
interface</a> or check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.</p>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `woody'.</p>

<h3>Point releases</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.</p>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
dists/woody-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/woody-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Internationalized Installation Support</h3>

<p>An internationalized version of the installation system for i386 is <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/current-i18n/">available</a> for
testing and use.  You need to use the 'idepci' or 'compact' flavors.</p>

<h3>Unofficial ReiserFS Support</h3>

<p>There seem to be at least two unofficial versions of the
installation system for i386 supporting ReiserFS.</p>

<p>One version is from John H. Robinson, IV, and is available with
some instructions at <a
href="http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/">
http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/</a>.</p>

<p>The other is from Marc A. Volovic and is available at <a
href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/">
http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/</a>.</p>


<h3>Unofficial Linux Kernel 2.4 Support</h3>

<p>
Adrian Bunk has provided a set of packages for i386 Potato systems
which provide compatibility for Linux Kernel 2.4.x.  Please read <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">
http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html</a> for instructions,
warnings, and lines to add to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="reporting-bugs">Reporting Problems</a></h2>

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt> package.  Information you
should submit with your report is discussed in the <a
href="i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-troubleshooting">Installation
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the <a
href="#new-inst">Installation Manual</a>, you should also file those
as bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.</p>

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list, <a
href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and file a bug against that
package.</p>

<p>For information on how to file bugs, see the 
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking web page</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="credits">Credits (or Blame)</a></h2>

<h3>Installation System</h3>

<p>Many Debian developers, translators, documenters, testers, and
users have contributed to the development of the installation system
-- too many to mention, in fact. Adam Di Carlo was the maintainer of
the boot-floppies during the period of the Woody release.  Other
significant contributors can be found in the <code>Maintainers</code>
file of the <code>boot-floppies</code> package.</p>

<h3>The rest of Debian</h3>
