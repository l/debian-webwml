#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``woody'' Release Information" BARETITLE="true"

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after
<a href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  It is likely that this
release will be numbered either ``2.3'' or ``3.0''.

<p>This distribution is currently in
``<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">testing</a>'' phase.
That means that
things <em>might</em> break if you run it. Anyone running woody is
expected to be informed about any volatilities, usually by following
developer-oriented mailing lists; the testing distribution should be more
stable than unstable, but you should be cautious nevertheless.

<p>As usual, <strong>no</strong> specific release goals are being set,
<strong>nor</strong> will a release date be specified in advance. To put it
simply, "Debian releases when it is time".

<p>Expected major upgrades, by the time woody releases, include Linux kernel
2.4, GLibC 2.2, GCC 3.0, XFree86 4.0 and Perl 5.6. It's also likely that the
<code>debconf</code> package will be used in all the packages which need to
prompt in the maintainer scripts.

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access packages in
testing:

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian testing main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US testing/non-US main non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.
