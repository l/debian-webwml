#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``woody'' Release Information"

<p>

The code name for the next major Debian release after <a
href="../potato/">potato</a> is ``woody''.  It is likely that this
release will be numbered either ``2.3'' or ``3.0''.

<p>

This release is currently considered ``unstable''.  That means that
things <em>will</em> break if you run it. Woody isn't even a complete
or functioning system yet.

<p>

There are no specific release goals yet, although we have decided to
completely gut boot-floppies.  It's also likely that the
<tt>debconf</tt> package will be made obligatory for any packages
which need to prompt in the maintainer scripts.
