<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (a.k.a. <em>woody</em>) was released on 19th of
July, 2002. The new release includes many major changes, described in
our <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020719">press release</a> and the
<a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>Please note that the Debian project has released
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/"><b>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1</b> (<em>sarge</em>)</a>
on 6th June 2005, so you may not want to use the Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 for new
installations.  The security team has
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20050708">announced</a> that it will continue to
provide security updates for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (<em>woody</em>) until May
2006 or until security support for etch (the release following sarge)
starts.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 is available <a href="$(DISTRIB)/">from
the Internet</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/CD/vendors/">from CD vendors</a>.</p>

<p>Before installing Debian, please read the <A HREF="installmanual">
Installation Manual</A>. The Installation Manual for your target
architecture contains instructions and links for all the files you need to
install.</p>

<p>The following computer architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<ul>
<:
foreach $arch (sort keys %arches) {
  if ($arch eq "mipsel") { # both MIPS ports have the same web page
    print "<li><a href=\"$(HOME)/ports/mips/\">$arches{$arch}</a>\n";
  } else {
    print "<li><a href=\"$(HOME)/ports/$arch/\">$arches{$arch}</a>\n";
  }
}
:>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there may be some problems that exist in the woody
release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can always
<a href="reportingbugs">report other issues</a> to us.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
credit</a> for making this release happen.</p>
