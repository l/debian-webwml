<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in <q>Wheezy</q>.</p>

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ wheezy/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="pointrelease">Point releases</toc-add-entry>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<ifeq <current_release_wheezy> 7.0 "

<p>There are no point releases for Debian 7.0 yet.</p>" "

<p>See the <a
href=http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy/ChangeLog>\
ChangeLog</a>
for details on changes between 7.0 and <current_release_wheezy/>.</p>"/>


<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/wheezy-proposed-updates/">\
dists/wheezy-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.</p>

<p>If you use APT to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 7.0 point release
  deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian wheezy-proposed-updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>
