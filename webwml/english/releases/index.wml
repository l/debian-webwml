<p>Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: <q>stable</q>, <q>testing</q> and
<q>unstable</q>.</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The <q>stable</q> distribution contains the latest officially
  released distribution of Debian.
</p>
<p>
  This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily
  recommend using.
</p>
<p>
  The current <q>stable</q> distribution of Debian is version
  <:=substr '<current_initial_release>', 0, 1:>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.
<ifeq "<current_initial_release>" "<current_release>"
  "It was released on <current_release_date>."
/>
<ifneq "<current_initial_release>" "<current_release>"
  "It was initially released as version <current_initial_release>
  on <current_initial_release_date> and its latest
  update, version <current_release>, was released on <current_release_date>."
/>
</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The <q>testing</q> distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a <q>stable</q> release yet, but they are in the queue for
  that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more
  recent versions of software.

  and <a href="$(DOC)/manuals/debian-faq/ch-ftparchives#s-frozen">how it becomes

  The current <q>testing</q> distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
</p>
</dd>

<dt><a href="unstable/">unstable</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>
  The <q>unstable</q> distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
</p>
<p>
  The <q>unstable</q> distribution is always called <em>sid</em>.

<p>The web pages for the obsolete Debian releases are kept intact, but
the releases themselves can only be found in a separate
<a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">archive</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/debian-faq/">Debian FAQ</a> for an explanation of
<a href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/debian-faq/ch-ftparchives#s-sourceforcodenames">where
all these codenames came from</a>.</p>

<h2>Integrity of the data in the releases</h2>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code>
file. To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, checksums of
all <code>Packages</code> files are copied into the <code>Release</code>
file.</p>

<p>Digital signatures for this file are stored in the file
<code>Release.gpg</code>, using the current version of the archive signing
key. For <q>stable</q> and <q>oldstable</q> an additional signature is
generated using an offline key specifically generated for a release
by a member of the <a href="$(HOME)/intro/organization#release-team">\
Stable Release Team</a>.</p>
