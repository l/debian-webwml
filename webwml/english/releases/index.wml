<p>Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: ``stable'', ``testing'' and
``unstable''.

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
  <dd>The ``stable'' distribution contains the latest officially
  released distribution of Debian.
<p>
  This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily
  recommend using.
<p>
  The current ``stable'' distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is version
  <current_release>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.  It was
  released on <current_release_date>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
  <dd>The ``testing'' distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a ``stable'' release yet, but they are in the queue for
  that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more
  recent versions of software, and the main disadvantage is that it's not
  completely tested and has no official support from Debian security team.
<p>
  See the <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/">Debian FAQ</a> for more information on
  <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-testing">what is ``testing''</a>
  and <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-frozen">how it becomes
  ``stable''</a>.
<p>
  The current ``testing'' distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
  </dd>

<dt>unstable</dt>
  <dd>The ``unstable'' distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
<p>
  The ``unstable'' distribution is called <em>sid</em>.
