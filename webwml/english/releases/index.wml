<p>Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: &ldquo;stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;testing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unstable&rdquo;.

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution contains the latest officially
  released distribution of Debian.
<p>
  This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily
  recommend using.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is version
  <current_release>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.  It was
  released on <current_release_date>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release yet, but they are in the queue for
  that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more
  recent versions of software. Official security support for this
  distribution started May 3rd 2005.

  and <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-frozen">how it becomes
  &ldquo;stable&rdquo;</a>.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="unstable/">unstable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
<p>
  The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is called <em>sid</em>.

<p>The web pages for the obsolete Debian releases are kept intact, but
the releases themselves can only be found in a separate
<a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">archive</a>.

<h2>Integrity of the data in the releases</h2>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code>
file. To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, MD5 checksums of
all <code>Packages</code> files are copied into the <code>Release</code>
file.</p>

<p>Digital signatures for this file are stored in the file
<code>Release.gpg</code>, using the key called
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2005.asc">ziyi_key_2005</a>
(expires on the 31th of January 2006).</p>

<p>This key can be used with
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs">apt-check-sigs</a>
to protect your use of apt-get from malicious or exploited mirrors and so
forth. Further applications of this are planned or in development.</p>
