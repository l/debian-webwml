<p>Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: &ldquo;stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;testing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unstable&rdquo;.

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution contains the latest officially
  released distribution of Debian.
<p>
  This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily
  recommend using.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is version
  <current_release>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.  It was
  released on <current_release_date>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release yet, but they are in the queue for
  that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more
  recent versions of software.
<p>
  See the <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/">Debian FAQ</a> for more information on
  <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-testing">what is &ldquo;testing&rdquo;</a>
  and <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-frozen">how it becomes
  &ldquo;stable&rdquo;</a>.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="unstable/">unstable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
<p>
  The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is called <em>sid</em>.

<p>The web pages for the obsolete Debian releases are kept intact, but
the releases themselves can only be found in a separate

<h2>Integrity of the data in the releases</h2>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code>
file. To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, MD5 checksums of
all <code>Packages</code> files are copied into the <code>Release</code>
file.</p>

<p>Digital signatures for this file are stored in the file
<code>Release.gpg</code>, using the current version of the archive signing
key.</p>
