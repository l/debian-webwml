      <h2>Releases by Status</h2>

<p>

The following releases are presented based on their release status.
These links will always be available, since Debian always has at least
two releases in active maintenance: ``stable'' and ``unstable''.

<dl>
	<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a>
	<dd>
The ``stable'' distribution contains the most recent, officially
released distribution of Debian.  This is the production release of
Debian. The current ``stable'' distribution is <em>
<: print readlink('stable'); :>
</em>
</dd>
	<dt><a href="unstable/">unstable</a>
	<dd>
The ``unstable'' distribution is where active development of Debian
occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
who like to live on the edge.  The current ``unstable'' distribution
is <em>
<: print readlink('unstable'); :>
</em>

<: if ( -d 'frozen' ) { _:>
	<dt><a href="frozen/">frozen</a>
	<dd>
The ``frozen'' distribution is a release candidate as the next
``stable'' distribution.  At this point, there is a ``frozen''
distribution; usually, there is only ``stable'' and ``unstable''
distributions. The current ``frozen'' distribution is <em>
