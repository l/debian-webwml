<h2>Releases by Status</h2>

<p>The following releases are presented based on their release status.
These links will always be available, since Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: ``stable'', ``testing'' and
``unstable''.

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
  <dd>The ``stable'' distribution contains the most recent, officially
  released distribution of Debian.  This is the production release of
  Debian.
<p>
  The current ``stable'' distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is version
  <current_release>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.  It was
  released on <current_release_date>.
  </dd>


<: if ( $frozen_release_exists ) { :>
<dt><a href="frozen/">frozen</a></dt>
  <dd>The ``frozen'' distribution is a release candidate as the next
  ``stable'' distribution.  At this point, there is a ``frozen''
  distribution; usually, there is only ``stable'' and ``unstable''
  distributions.
<p>
  The current ``frozen'' distribution is <em><current_frozen_name></em>.
  </dd>
<: } :>


<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
  <dd>The ``testing'' distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a ``stable'' release yet, but they don't have
  release-critical bugs filed against them, and have been in use for a
  while. See the <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/">more detailed
  explanation</a>.
<p>
  The current ``testing'' distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
  </dd>


<dt>unstable</dt>
  <dd>The ``unstable'' distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
<p>
  The ``unstable'' distribution is called <em>sid</em>.
  </dd>
