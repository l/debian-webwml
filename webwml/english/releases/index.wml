<p>Debian always has at least
three releases in active maintenance: &ldquo;stable&rdquo;, &ldquo;testing&rdquo; and
&ldquo;unstable&rdquo;.

<dl>
<dt><a href="stable/">stable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution contains the latest officially
  released distribution of Debian.
<p>
  This is the production release of Debian, the one which we primarily
  recommend using.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;stable&rdquo; distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is version
  <current_release>, codenamed <em><current_release_name></em>.  It was
  released on <current_release_date>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="testing/">testing</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution contains packages that haven't been
  accepted into a &ldquo;stable&rdquo; release yet, but they are in the queue for
  that. The main advantage of using this distribution is that it has more
  recent versions of software, and the main disadvantage is that it's not
  completely tested and has no official support from Debian security team.
<p>
  See the <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/">Debian FAQ</a> for more information on
  <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-testing">what is &ldquo;testing&rdquo;</a>
  and <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-frozen">how it becomes
  &ldquo;stable&rdquo;</a>.
<p>
  The current &ldquo;testing&rdquo; distribution is <em><current_testing_name></em>.
  </dd>

<dt><a href="unstable/">unstable</a></dt>
  <dd>The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is where active development of Debian
  occurs.  Generally, this distribution is run by developers and those
  who like to live on the edge.
<p>
  The &ldquo;unstable&rdquo; distribution is called <em>sid</em>.

<h2>Integrity of the data in the releases</h2>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code>
file. To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, MD5 checksums of
all <code>Packages</code> files are copied into the <code>Release</code>
file.</p>

<p>Digital signatures for this file are stored in the file
<code>Release.gpg</code>, using the key called
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2004.asc">ziyi_key_2004</a>
(expires on the 27th of January 2005).</p>

<p>This key can be used with
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs">apt-check-sigs</a>
to protect your use of apt-get from malicious or exploited mirrors and so
forth. Further applications of this are planned or in development.</p>
