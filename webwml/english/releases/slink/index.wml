<p>

Debian 2.1, which is also known as ``slink'', is now available.
The following architectures are supported in Debian 2.1:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

At this point, Debian 2.1 is still considered <em>frozen</em>, which
is to say it is not officially released.  <em>Caveat emptor!</em>


<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>

To find out what's new for Debian 2.1, see the Release Notes for
your architecture:

<ul>
<: &permute_file('release-notes/index', 'Release Notes', 'html', 'txt'); :>
</ul>

<h2>New Installations</h2>

<p>

Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:
<ul>
<: &permute_file('install', 'Install Manual', 'html', 'pdf', 'txt'); :>
</ul>

A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in
order to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures
(notably <:=$arches{'alpha'}:>) still need work -- see the document
itself for information on how you can contribute.

<p>

These web pages will be updated with new versions of the
Installation Manual for slink as they become available.

<h3>Errata</h3>

<p>

Slink is certified for use with the 2.0.x series of Linux kernels.  If
you wish to run the Linux 2.2.x kernel with slink, see the <a
