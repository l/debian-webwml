<strong>Debian 2.1 has been superseded.</strong>

<p>

Since <a href="../">newer releases</a> have been made, the 2.1 release
has been superseded.  These pages are being retained for historical
purposes.  You should be aware that Debian 2.1 is no longer maintained.

<p>

The following architectures are supported in Debian 2.1:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (@arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>


<h2><a name="release-notes"></a>Release Notes</h2>

<p>

To find out what's new for Debian 2.1, see the Release Notes for your
architecture.  The Release Notes also contain instructions for users
who are upgrading from prior releases.

<ul>
<: &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>
<: print $about_lang_setting; :>
</p>

<div class="centerdiv">
<table class="reltable">
<tr>
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<: &permute_as_matrix('release-notes', 'english', 'croatian', 'czech',
		      'japanese', 'portuguese', 'russian');
:>
</table>
</div>

<p>

For the i386 architecture, a <a href="i386/reports">detailed
report</a> is available which describes packages which have changed
since the last two releases.


<h2><a name="new-inst"></a>New Installations</h2>

<p>

Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:
<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Install Manual'); :>
</ul>

<p>
<: print $about_lang_setting; :>
</p>


<div class="centerdiv">
<table class="reltable">
<tr>
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<:= &permute_as_matrix('install', 'english', 'croatian', 'czech', 
		      'finnish', 'french', 
		      'japanese', 'portuguese', 'russian', 'spanish');
:>
</table>
</div>

Note that German documentation is also available, but only for the
i386 architecture; you can view that as
<a href="i386/install.de.txt">ASCII</a>,
<a href="i386/install.de.pdf">PDF</a>, or
<a href="i386/install.de.html">HTML</a>.

<p>

A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in
order to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures
(notably <:=$arches{'alpha'}:>) still need work -- see the document
itself for information on how you can contribute.

<p>

These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for slink as they become available.  If you wish to contribute
changes, see the section and the manual; you can also retrieve the <a
href="source/">SGML source</a> -- patches are the best form of
comments.  Contributors or readers wonder exactly what is new should
see the <a href="source/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.


<h2><a name="errata"></a>Errata</h2>

<p>

Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution (in this case, Slink) is updated.  Generally,
these are indicated as point releases.  The current point release is
Debian 2.1r5.  You can find the <a
href="http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/slink/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
on any Debian archive mirror.

<p>

Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However,
these fixes are available in the <a
href="http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/slink-proposed-updates/">
dists/slink-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.  If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can
install the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org dists/slink-proposed-updates/
</pre>
Next, run <kbd>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</kbd>.

<p>

Slink is certified for use with the 2.0.x series of Linux kernels.  If
you wish to run the Linux 2.2.x kernel with slink, see the <a
href="running-kernel-2.2">list of known problems</a>.


<h2><a name="unofficial-updates"></a>Unofficial Updates</h2>

<p>

Released Debian versions are only updated in cases
of critical errors or security issues.  However, for user convenience,
there is certain updated software which is made available
unofficially by other users and developers.  Material in this section
is not officially supported by Debian.


<h3>Internationalized Boot Floppies</h3>

<p>

Unofficial Portuguese boot-floppies are available at ftp://ftp2.escelsanet.com.br/debian/.


<h3>Rescue Floppy</h3>

<p>

Users of Adaptec 2940 SCSI cards, and other SCSI controllers with the
aic7xxx chipset, will probably experience problems with the standard
boot-floppies.  A kind user has made some experiments which many users
find to solve their problems.  There are two alternative Rescue
Floppies for the i386 architecture at ftp://kalle.csb.ki.se/pub/.
There are also replacement kernels in that location, which you can use
to simply replace the existing kernels on the boot-floppies.  You'll
need the Drivers Floppy from the standard location.

<p>

A competing and newer set of Rescue and Driver Floppies for Adaptec
users can be found at http://www.debian.org/~adric/aic7xxx/.



<h3>Gnome</h3>

<p>

If you want to run the latest Gnome on from stable, see 
GNOME update for Debian 2.1 (http://www.gnome.org/start/debian-readme.html).


<h3>APT</h3>

<p>

An updated version of <code>apt</code> is available in Debian, as of
2.1r3.  The benefits of this updated version is primarily that it is
able to handle installation from multiple CD-ROMs itself.  This makes
the <code>dpkg-multicd</code> acquisition option in
<code>dselect</code> unnecessary.  However, your 2.1 CD-ROM may
contain an older <code>apt</code>, so you might want to upgrade based
on the one now in Slink.



<h2><a name="acquiring"></a>Getting Debian 2.1</h2>

<p>

Debian is available electronically or from CD vendors.

<h3>Buying Debian on CD</h3>

<p>

We maintain a <a href="../../CD/vendors/">list of CD vendors</a>
that sell CDs of Debian 2.1.


<h3>Downloading Debian Over the Internet</h3>

<p>

We maintain a <a href="../../distrib/ftplist">list of sites</a> which
mirror the distribution.
