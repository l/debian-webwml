      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>


<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>

To find out what's new for Debian 2.1, see the Release Notes for your
architecture.  The Release Notes also contain instructions for users
who are upgrading from prior releases.

<ul>
<: &permute_file('release-notes/index', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

The Release Notes are available in Croatian, Czech, English, and
Japanese.
<: print $about_lang_setting; :>

<p>

For the i386 architecture, a <a href="i386/reports">detailed
report</a> is available which describes packages which have changed
since the last two releases.


<h2>New Installations</h2>

<p>

Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:
<ul>
<: &permute_file('install', 'Install Manual'); :>
</ul>

A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in
order to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures
(notably <:=$arches{'alpha'}:>) still need work -- see the document
itself for information on how you can contribute.

<p>

These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for slink as they become available.  If you wish to contribute
changes, see the section and the manual; you can also retrieve the <a
href="source/">SGML source</a> -- patches are the best form of
comments.  Contributors or readers wonder exactly what is new should
see the <a href="source/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.

<p>

The Installation Manual is available in Croatian, Czech, English,
Finnish, French, and Japanese.

<h2>Gnome</h2>

<p>

Gnome is an important set of programs and many people desire the latest
now.  Accordingly, A number of developers have put together the latest
stable software into debs for slink.  Checkout <A HREF="gnome">the
Slink/Gnome page</A> for more details.

<h2>Errata</h2>

<p>

Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution (in this case, Slink) is updated.  Generally,
these are indicated as point releases.  The current point release is
Debian 2.1r2.  You can find the <a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/slink/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
on any Debian archive mirror.

<p>

Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However,
these fixes are available in the <a
href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/slink-proposed-updates/">
dists/slink-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.  If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can
install the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>
Next, run <kbd>apt-get update; apt-get upgrade</kbd>.


<p>

Slink is certified for use with the 2.0.x series of Linux kernels.  If
you wish to run the Linux 2.2.x kernel with slink, see the <a
href="running-kernel-2.2">list of known problems</a>.
