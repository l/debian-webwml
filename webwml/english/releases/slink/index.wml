<p>

Debian 2.1, which is also known as ``slink'', is now available.
The following architectures are supported in Debian 2.1:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>


<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>

To find out what's new for Debian 2.1, see the Release Notes for your
architecture.  The Release Notes also contain instructions for users
who are upgrading from prior releases.

<ul>
<: &permute_file('release-notes/index', 'Release Notes', 'html', 'txt'); :>
</ul>

The Release Notes are available in Croatian, Czech, English, and Japanese.

<p>

For the i386 architecture, a <a href="i386/reports">detailed
report</a> about packages which have changed since the last two
releases is available.


<h2>New Installations</h2>

<p>

Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:
<ul>
<: &permute_file('install', 'Install Manual', 'html', 'pdf', 'txt'); :>
</ul>

A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in
order to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures
(notably <:=$arches{'alpha'}:>) still need work -- see the document
itself for information on how you can contribute.

<p>

These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for slink as they become available.  If you wish to contribute
changes, see the section and the manual; you can also retrieve the <a
href="source/">SGML source</a> -- patches are the best form of
comments.  Contributors or readers wonder exactly what is new should
see the <a href="source/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.

<p>

The Installation Manual is available in Croatian, Czech, English, 
Finnish, French, and Japanese.
