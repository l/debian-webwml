<p>
Debian 2.1, which is also known as ``slink'', is now available.
The following architectures are supported in Debian 2.1:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

At this point, Debian 2.1 is still considered <em>frozen</em>, which
is to say it is not officially released.  <em>Caveat emptor!</em>


<h2>Release Notes</h2>

<p>
To find out what's new for Debian 2.1, see the 

<h2>New Installations</h2>

<p>
Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by platform:
<ul>
<: &permute_file('install', 'Install Manual', 'html', 'pdf', 'txt'); :>
</ul>

A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in
order to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures
(notably <:=$arches{'alpha'}:>) still need work -- see the document
itself for information on how you can contribute.

<p> These web pages will be updated with new versions of the
Installation Manual for slink as they become available
