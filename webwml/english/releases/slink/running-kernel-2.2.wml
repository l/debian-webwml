#use wml::debian::template title="Errata: Running Linux 2.2.x in slink"

<p>

This page documents known problems with running the Linux 2.2.x kernel
in Debian 2.1 (slink).  It assumes that you are running a fully
up-to-date slink system.

<p>

The slink release is certified and officially tested for use with the
late 2.0.x Linux kernels.  Since the freeze of Debian occurred before
Linux 2.2's release, and the change of the kernel's major version
number can introduce complex issues, it was decided to stick with the
proven 2.0 line of kernels.

<p>

Debian releases, however, are not necessarily kernel version bound.
You may run any kernel you wish in Debian.  We simply can give no
assurances, however, that everything will function properly.  If you
do decide to move up to the Linux 2.2 line, and experience problems
with a package, you may have luck running the <a href="../potato/">
potato</a> (Debian 2.2) version of that package.

<p>

There are many links below pointing to potato versions of packages.
Note that if you install these packages on a stable machine, you may
need to also install potato libraries or other packages dependencies.
Notably, you'll probably have to upgrade your libc6 package.  We
suggest using <code>apt-get</code> for this purpose, which will get
only the necessary packages when used correctly.  However, be warned:
while most users have no trouble running a stable/frozen mixed
system, you may be bitten by transient bugs in potato.

<p>

The <a href="https://packages.debian.org/kernel-source-2.2.1">
kernel-source-2.2.1</a> package is shipped in the distribution to aid
users who want to run the Linux 2.2.x kernels.  However, it is
recommended that you check the standard kernel distribution sites,
such as <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">kernel.org</a>, for newer
versions of the 2.2.x source tree and additional errata.  There are
known bugs in 2.2.1, and that version is known to have caused data
corruption for some.  You should get the patches for the newer 2.2
series kernel and apply them to the Linux kernel source tree.


<h2>Potentially Problematic Packages</h2>

<p>

Note that this list may be incomplete.  Please submit a bug against
www.debian.org if you find other problems not listed.  Check the bug
logs for the package in question as well as well; try to make sure
that the problem was introduced in Linux 2.2.

<dl>
	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/sysutils">sysutils</a>
	<dd>
<tt>procinfo</tt> will not run.  The version from
<a href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/utils/sysutils.html">
potato</a> fixes this.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/netbase">netbase</a>
	<dd>
In Linux 2.2, <tt>ipautofw</tt> must be replaced by <tt>ipmasqadm</tt>
and <tt>ipfwadm</tt> is replaced with <tt>ipchains</tt>.  The potato
<a href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/base/netbase.html">
netbase</a> package contains a wrapper script,
<tt>ipfwadm-wrapper</tt>, to ease the transition.
<p>
<tt>ifconfig</tt> won't show aliases interfaces, and under some
circumstances, <tt>ipchains</tt> will silently fail to clear packet
counters.  Some routes built by the <tt>netbase</tt> init scripts
will cause harmless warning messages.
<p>
All of these issues are solved in the <a
href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/base/netbase.html">
potato</a> version. If you do not wish to upgrade to potato, Debian
2.1-compatible packages have been <a
href="https://www.debian.org/~rcw/2.2/netbase/">made available</a>.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/pcmcia-source">pcmcia-source</a>
	<dd>
The version of <tt>pcmcia-source</tt> in slink cannot be compiled with
the 2.2 kernel.  Fixed in the 
<a href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/admin/pcmcia-source.html">
potato</a> version.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/dhcpcd">dhcpcd</a>
	<dd>
Breaks under Linux 2.2; use the <a
href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/net/dhcpcd.html">
potato</a> version.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/dhcp-client-beta">dhcp-client-beta</a>
	<dd>
The <tt>/etc/dhclient-script</tt> doesn't work with 2.2. The version
from
<a href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/net/dhcp-client.html">
potato</a> fixes this; note the package was renamed to just
<code>dhcp-client</code>.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/wanpipe">wanpipe</a>
	<dd>
Version 2.0.1, in slink, is incompatible with the 2.2. kernels.
Version 2.0.4 and up, which you can get from 
<a href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/frozen/net/wanpipe.html">
potato</a>, will work for the 2.2 kernels, but not with the 2.0
kernels (a kernel patch for 2.0 is included in the potato version,
however).

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/netstd">netstd</a>
	<dd>
<tt>bootpc</tt> will not receive a reply unless the interface has
already been configured. This has been fixed in the now-separate <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/bootpc">bootpc package</a> in potato.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/lsof">lsof</a>
	<dd>
<tt>lsof</tt> needs a recompile to work with linux 2.2. Upgrade to the
<tt>lsof</tt> package available from potato.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/acct">acct</a>
	<dd>
The accounting structure has changed in the 2.2 kernel, so if you are
running <tt>acct</tt> and Linux 2.2, you'll need the version of the
package from potato (which is incompatible with the 2.0 series
kernels).

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/isdnutils">isdnutils</a>
	<dd>
<tt>isdnutils</tt> 3.0 or greater in Debian should work with both 2.0
and 2.2 series kernels.  This is only the case because the Debian
package maintainer took special trouble to make sure this is the
case. Other distributions may not be so lucky.

	<dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/diald">diald</a>
	<dd>
The slink <tt>diald</tt> package has problems creating routes
dynamically in Linux 2.2.  Upgrade to the version available in
potato.

        <dt><a href="https://packages.debian.org/xosview">xosview</a>
	<dd>
<tt>xosview</tt> will loop endlessly on Linux 2.2.2 and greater.
Upgrade to the version available in potato.
