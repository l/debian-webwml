#use wml::debian::template title="GNOME update for Debian 2.1 (slink)"

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <p>This update consists of packages from the Debian development
    tree. It has not been led through the same release procedure as
    the Debian 2.1 release with freeze, extensive testing
    etc. Therefore, the packages in this update may not be as stable
    as the rest of Debian 2.1. The glibc2.1 versions of these packages
    are in use by Debian developers and interested users though,
    so they work. But you have been warned.</p>

    <p>Also only the update for the i386 architecture is complete.</p>

    <h2>New Installation</h2>

    <p>The best way to install the GNOME update for Debian slink is
    to use the <tt>apt</tt> method in dselect.</p>

    <ol>

    <li><p>First add the following line to
    <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>: </p> <blockquote>deb
    http://www.debian.org/~jim/debian-gtk-gnome/gnome-stage-slink
    slink main</blockquote>

    <!--
	<p>You can also use one of the GNOME mirrors. See the <a
	href="http://www.gnome.org/start/getting_debian.shtml#mirrors">GNOME
	for Debian</a> page for the sources.list lines.</p>
    -->

    <li><p>Then start <tt>dselect</tt> and make sure at the
	  <tt>[A]ccess</tt> step, that you use apt as the access method.
	  Update the package list with <tt>[U]pdate</tt> and choose
	  <tt>[S]elect</tt>.</p></li>
	
    <li><p>Now you can choose from the GNOME packages. Either select
	  the packages you are interested in, or select one of the
	  meta packages we provide. Use the "<tt>/</tt>" key to search
	  for them in the list. These packages will install a set of
	  packages for users who want a fairly normal GNOME desktop,
	  but do not feel confident to select the packages manually.
	  The meta packages are:</p> <p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>task-gnome-desktop</dt> <dd>This package will install
	    the basic components that create the GNOME desktop
	    environment as well as the <a
	      href="http://www.gnome.org/users-guide/project.shtml">GNOME user's guide</a>.
	  </dd>
	  <dt>task-gnome-apps</dt>
	  <dd>This package will install a fairly complete set of GNOME
	    programs and utilities</dd>
	  <dt>task-gnome-net</dt>
	  <dd>Here are the programs for use on netwoks, like a mail
	    reader or irc clients</dd>
	  <dt>task-gnome-wm</dt>
	  <dd>Although GNOME can be used with any window manager,
	    GNOME compliant ones have some advantages through better
	    interaction. This package installs the available GNOME
	    compliant window managers, so you can give them a
	    try.</dd>
	  <dt>task-gnome-games</dt>
	  <dd>With this package, you get the full load of GNOME
	    games.</dd>
	</dl> </p>
      </li>

      <li>After selecting the packages, hit <tt>[I]nstall</tt> to get
	apt going.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>After installation, you can remove these meta packages. The
    packages installed by selecting these metapackages won't get
    removed, but this step will allow you to deinstall any of the
    packages automatically installed.</p>

    <p>An alternative is to use apt-get instead of dselect to install
    these packages. Use commands like the following to do this:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install task-gnome-apps task-gnome-net
</pre></blockquote>

    <h2>Upgrading an old GNOME Installation</h2>

    <p>To upgrade your old GNOME 0.3 installation from Debian 2.1, add
    the location of the packages to <tt>sources.list</tt> as described
    above. Then run </p>

<blockquote><pre>
apt-get update
apt-get dselect-upgrade
</pre></blockquote>

    <p>This way, your existing packages will be updated, and your
    selection of packages will not be altered more than necessary. Of
    course you can also use dselect with the apt method as described
    above. You can then add additional packages as usual with
    <tt>apt-get install &lt;packagename&gt;</tt>, dselect or dpkg</p>


<!--    <p>The procedure to update your existing GNOME 0.3 installation
    from the Debian slink release is the same as the first
    installation method described above. Of course, you don't have to
    select additional packages, if you are satisfied with your current
    selection. In this case, you can skip dselect but use <tt>apt-get
    update &amp;&amp; apt-get dist-upgrade</tt> to install newer versions
    of your current packages.</p>
-->
    <h2>Running GNOME</h2>

    <p>There are two recommended ways to run the GNOME desktop. In
    both cases, you have to edit the file <tt>.xsession</tt> in your
    home directory. You may have to create this file if it is not
    present yet.</p>
    <ul>

      <li>You can use just the line <blockquote>exec
      gnome-session</blockquote> as the only thing in the file. This
      is the way recommended by the GNOME developers. gnome-session
      will then manage the programs to start at startup, as well as
	the window manager to use. See the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/users-guide/project.shtml">GNOME user's guide</a> accessable
      through the gnome-help-browser for further details. We have reports of
      gnome-session sometimes reseting the desktop thus loosing your
      customisations. For the ones who want to play safe, the second
      option is preferable.</li>

      <li>You can also choose not to use gnome-session, but call the
      panel directly, as in 
<blockquote><pre>
xterm &         # Start a xterm
wmaker-gnome &  # start the window maker window manager 
panel           # start the gnome panel
</pre></blockquote>

      Using this setup is the safest option, but you loose the ability
      to change the window manager in the GNOME control center.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beware</h2>

    <p>Although GNOME is stable enough for everyday use, some packages
    may be problematic.</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>gnome-session</dt> <dd>Sometimes gnome session forgets about
      your desktop settings and resets the panel and other
      things.</dd>

      <dt>gdm</dt> <dd>gdm is a substitute for xdm, thus providing
      login services. This package is not ready for production use. It
      interferes badly with xdm, sometimes even causing screen
      freezes. So beware if you want to use it, it once filled my /var
      partition with a logfile in /var/state due to an error. Here is
      a short advice, if something goes wrong: to disable gdm at boot
      time if it locks up your machine, enter <tt>linux single</tt> at
      the lilo prompt to enter single user mode. Then disable gdm with
      <tt>chmod -x /etc/init.d/gdm</tt>. For big NIS environments,
      usage may be very slow, as gdm fetches the whole user map to
      display it for user selection. Of course the package may work for
      you without any problems. YMMV. As a security measure, gdm won't
      serve a display, nor will it listen to xdmcp. To enable these
      functions, edit <tt>/etc/gdm/gdm.conf</tt> .
      </dd>
      
      <dt>gmc</dt> <dd>Although stability has improved greatly, it is
      still possible to crash gmc in extreme conditions. Also startup
      can be slow in big NIS or automounted environments, as gmc reads
      all subdirectories of the user's home directory to determine if
      there are subdirectories present.</dd>

      <dt>imlib</dt> <dd>Imlib changed the location of the configfiles
      from /etc/im/ to /etc/imlib/. This affects users who chose
      <tt>Force Palette</tt> in the imlib config editor or enabled
      <tt>PaletteOverride</tt> in .imrc. You will then get the error
<blockquote>
<pre>
GImLib ERROR: Cannot find file : /etc/im/im_palette.pal
gdk_imlib : Cannot find Palette. A Palette file is required for this mode
</pre>
</blockquote>
	To fix this problem, edit the file .imrc in you home directory
	and change the first line of the file from
<pre>
PaletteFile /etc/im/im_palette.pal                                              
PaletteOverride yes      
</pre>

	to 

<pre>
PaletteFile /etc/imlib/im_palette.pal                                              
PaletteOverride yes      
</pre>

      </dd>
    </dl>
