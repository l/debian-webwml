#use wml::debian::template title="The unstable distribution (sid)"

<p>The code name for Debian's development distribution is "sid", aliased
to "unstable". Most of the development work that is done in Debian, is
uploaded to this distribution. This distribution will never get released;
instead, packages from it will propagate into testing and then into a real
release.</p>

<p>Please note that security updates for "unstable" distribution are
<strong>not</strong> managed by the security team. Hence, "unstable" does
<strong>not</strong> get security updates in a timely manner. For more
information please see the <a href="../security/faq#testing">Security Team's
FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>"sid" is subject to massive changes and in-place
library updates.  This can result in a very "unstable" system which
contains packages that cannot be installed due to missing libraries,
dependencies that cannot be fulfilled etc.  Use it at your own risk!</p>
