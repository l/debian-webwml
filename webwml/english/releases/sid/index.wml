#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``sid'' Release Information"

<p>The code name for the development Debian release is ``sid''.  This
distribution is aliased to ``unstable'' and will contain most of the
development work which is done to the Debian distribution.</p>

<p>This distribution is subject to massive changes and in-place
library updates.  This can result in a very ``unstable'' system which
contains packages that cannot be installed due to missing libraries,
dependencies that cannot (yet) be fulfilled etc.  Use at your own
risk.</p>
