#use wml::debian::template title="Debian unstable (``sid'') distribution"

<p>The code name for Debian's development distribution is ``sid''.  This
distribution is aliased to ``unstable'' and will contain most of the
development work which is done in Debian. This distribution will never
get released; instead, packages from it will propagate into testing and
then into a real release.</p>

<p>``sid'' is subject to massive changes and in-place
library updates.  This can result in a very ``unstable'' system which
contains packages that cannot be installed due to missing libraries,
dependencies that cannot be fulfilled etc.  Use it at your own risk!</p>
