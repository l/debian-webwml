#use wml::debian::template title="The unstable distribution (<q>sid</q>)"

<p>The code name for Debian's development distribution is <q>sid</q>, aliased
#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/releases/arches.data"
to <q>unstable</q>. Most of the development work that is done in Debian, is
uploaded to this distribution. This distribution will never get released;
instead, packages from it will propagate into testing and then into a real
release.</p>

<p>Please note that security updates for <q>unstable</q> distribution are
<strong>not</strong> managed by the security team. Hence, <q>unstable</q> does
<strong>not</strong> get security updates in a timely manner. For more
information please see the <a href="$(HOME)/security/faq#testing">Security
Team's FAQ</a>.</p>

<p><q>sid</q> is subject to massive changes and in-place
library updates.  This can result in a very <q>unstable</q> system which
contains packages that cannot be installed due to missing libraries,
dependencies that cannot be fulfilled etc.  Use it at your own risk!</p>
