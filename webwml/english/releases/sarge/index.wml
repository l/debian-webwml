#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``sarge'' Release Information"

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after <a
href="../woody/">woody</a> is ``sarge''.  It is likely that this
release will be numbered ``3.1''.</p>

<p>This release is currently considered ``testing''.  That means that
things should not break if you run it.  It started as a copy of woody
and will include packages from the ``unstable'' distribution when the
regular rules apply (no release critical bugs, stable for a couple of days).</p>

<p>There are no specific release goals yet, although we have decided to
completely gut boot-floppies.</p>
