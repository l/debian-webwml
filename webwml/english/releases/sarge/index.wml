#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``sarge'' Release Information"

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after <a
href="../woody/">woody</a> is ``sarge''.  It is likely that this
release will be numbered ``3.1''.</p>

<p>This release started as a copy of woody, and is currently in a state
called ``<a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives.html#s-testing">testing</a>''.
That means that things should not break as bad as in unstable or
experimental distributions, because packages are allowed to enter this
distribution only after a certain period of time has passed, and when they
don't have any release-critical bugs filed against them.</p>

<p>To find out more about how the "testing" distribution works, check
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/testing">the developers' information about it</a>.</p>

<p>People often ask if there is a single release "progress meter".
Unfortunately there isn't one, but we can refer you to several places
that describe things needed to be dealt with for the release to happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">Release-critical bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://base.debian.net/">Base system bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://standard.debian.net/">Bugs in standard and task packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://bugs.debian.net/">Other bugs and bug squashing party notes</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, general status reports are posted by the release manager
to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/">\
debian-devel-announce mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>As usual, the release goals and the release date are <strong>not</strong>
going to be determined in advance. To put it simply, <cite>"Debian releases
when it is time"</cite>.</p>

<p>The major planned changes for <em>sarge</em> currently include
replacing the old boot-floppies installation system in favour of the new
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/">debian-installer</a>,
and use of GCC 3.2 as the default compiler on architectures that used 2.95
so far. Introduction of new versions of software such as Perl 5.8 and
XFree86 4.2/4.3 is also in progress.</p>
