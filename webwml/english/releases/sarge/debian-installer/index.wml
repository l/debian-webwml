<p>
This is a list of known problems in the installer shipped with 
Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_sarge>. If you have experienced a problem
installing Debian and do not see your problem listed here, please send us an 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem or 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.net/?DebianInstallerBrokenThings">check the wiki</a>
for other known problems.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>JFS broken on ia64.</b>
	The JFS filesystem is broken when installing ia64 using the
	(default) 2.6 kernel. Either avoid using JFS on ia64, or use the
	2.4 kernel.
	</li>
	<li><b>Red screen at boot.</b>
	Sometimes the installer may come up with a red screen at boot when
	using the 2.6 kernel. The install works fine, there is no error,
	but the screen background is just the wrong color, red, instead of
	blue. This is bug #<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/273192">273192</a>.
	</li>
	<li><b>SATA driver can block access to CD drive in installations
	from CD.</b>
	On systems having a SATA IDE controller that also has the CD drive
	connected to it, you may see the installer hanging during hardware
	detection for the CD drive or failing to read the CD just afterwards. A
	possible reason is that the SATA driver (ata_piix and maybe others) is
	blocking access to the CD drive.<br>
	You can try to work around this by booting the installer in expert mode
	and, in the "Detect and mount CD-ROM" step, selecting only the drivers
	needed for CD support. These are (ide-)generic, ide-cd and isofs.<br>
	The drivers needed to access the disk will still be loaded, but at a later
	stage. By loading the CD drivers before the SATA driver in this way, you
	may be able to complete the installation. Note that CD-ROM access may
	still be an issue after rebooting into the installed system.
	</li>
	<li><b>Installer fails to boot on some HP PA-RISC systems.</b>
	On some systems the ramdisk set up for the installer is too small by
	default. Booting the installer with parameter "ramdisk_size=21504" (or,
	if that also fails, a higher value) should solve this. This problem
	has so far been reported for HP9000-712/60 and HP715/100XC.
	</li>
</ul>

Improved versions of the installation system are being developed
for the next Debian release, and can be also be used to install sarge.
