<h2>Release management</h2>

<p>This release of Debian was managed by Anthony Towns, Steve Langasek, and
Colin Watson.</p>

<h2>Installation System</h2>

<p>The rewritten installation system featured in this release was made
possible through the efforts of many Debian developers, translators,
documenters, testers, and users -- too many to mention, in fact. 
Joey Hess led the team during the period of the Sarge release.</p>

<h2>The rest of Debian</h2>

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/devel/people">developers</a> and everyone else
who contributed.</p>
