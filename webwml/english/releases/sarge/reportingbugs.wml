#use wml::debian::template title="Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 -- Reporting Problems" BARETITLE=true

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>installation-reports</tt> package.  Fill out the
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/report-template">report template
</a> to ensure you include all the necessary information.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the
<a href="installmanual">Installation Manual</a>, you should file these
as bugs against the <tt>debian-installer-manual</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.</p>

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list,
<a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">\
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">file a bug</a> against that
package.</p>
