<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the

dists/squeeze-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.</p>

<p>If you use APT to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to

  deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian squeeze-proposed-updates main contrib non-free
