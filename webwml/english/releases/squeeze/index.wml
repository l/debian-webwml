<if-stable-release release="squeeze">

<p>Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_squeeze> was
released <current_release_date>. The release included many major
changes, described in 
our <a href="$(HOME)/News/XXXX/XXXXXXXX">press release</a> and 
the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>To obtain and install Debian GNU/Linux, see
the <a href="debian-installer/">installation information</a> page and the
<a href="installmanual">Installation Guide</a>. To upgrade from an older
Debian release, see the instructions in the
<a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p>The following computer architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<ul>
<:
foreach $arch (sort keys %arches) {
	print "<li><a href=\"$(HOME)/ports/$arch/\">$arches{$arch}</a>\n";
}
:>
</ul>

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there may be some problems that exist in the
release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can always
<a href="reportingbugs">report other issues</a> to us.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
credit</a> for making this release happen.</p>

<if-stable-release release="lenny">

<p>The code name for the next major Debian release after <a
href="../lenny/">lenny</a> is <q>squeeze</q>.</p>

<p>This release started as a copy of lenny, and is currently in a state
called <q><a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-testing">testing</a></q>.
That means that things should not break as badly as in unstable or
experimental distributions, because packages are allowed to enter this
distribution only after a certain period of time has passed, and when they
don't have any release-critical bugs filed against them.</p>

<p>Please note that security updates for <q>testing</q> distribution are
<strong>not</strong> yet managed by the security team. Hence, <q>testing</q> does
<strong>not</strong> get security updates in a timely manner. For more
information please see the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-security-announce/2008/12/msg00019.html">announcement</a>
of the Testing Security Team. You are encouraged to switch your
sources.list entries from testing to lenny for the time being if you
need security support. See also the entry in the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/faq#testing">Security Team's FAQ</a> for
the <q>testing</q> distribution.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="releasenotes">draft of the release notes available</a>.
Please also <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-notes">check the
proposed additions to the release notes</a>.</p>

<p>For installation images and documentation about how to install <q>testing</q>,
see <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">the Debian-Installer page</a>.</p>

<p>To find out more about how the <q>testing</q> distribution works, check
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/testing">the developers' information about it</a>.</p>

<p>People often ask if there is a single release <q>progress meter</q>.
Unfortunately there isn't one, but we can refer you to several places
that describe things needed to be dealt with for the release to happen:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://release.debian.org/">Generic release status page</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">Release-critical bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?base=only&amp;rc=1">Base system bugs</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?standard=only&amp;rc=1">Bugs in standard and task packages</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, general status reports are posted by the release manager
to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/">\
debian-devel-announce mailing list</a>.</p>
