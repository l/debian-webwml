/>
The release included many major
changes, described in 
our <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110205a">press release</a> and 
the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian 6.0 has been superseded by
<a href="../wheezy/">Debian 7.0 (<q>wheezy</q>)</a>.
# Security updates have been discontinued as of <:=spokendate('XXXXXXXXXXX'):>.
</strong></p>

<p><strong>Squeeze had benefited from Long Term Support (LTS) until
the end of February 2016. The LTS was limited to i386 and amd64. For more information,
please refer to the <a

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there may be some problems that exist in the
release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can always

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
