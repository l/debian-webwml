<h1>Installing Debian <current_release_squeeze></h1>


<p><strong>Debian 6.0 has been superseded by
<a href="../../wheezy/">Debian 7.0 (<q>wheezy</q>)</a>. Some of these
installation images may no longer be available, or may no longer work, and
you are recommended to install wheezy instead.

<p>
<strong>To install Debian</strong> <current_release_squeeze>
(<em>squeeze</em>), download any of the following images:
</p>

If any of the hardware in your system <strong>requires non-free firmware to be
loaded</strong> with the device driver, you can use one of the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/squeeze/current/">\
tarballs of common firmware packages</a> or download an <strong>non official</strong> image including these <strong>non-free</strong> firmwares. Instructions how to use the tarballs
and general information about loading firmware during an installation can
be found in the Installation Guide (see Documentation below).
</p>

<strong>Notes</strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
	For downloading full CD and DVD images the use of jigdo
	is recommended.
    </li><li>
	For the less common architectures only a limited number of images
	from the CD and DVD sets is available as ISO file.
	The full sets are only available via jigdo.
    </li><li>
	The multi-arch <em>CD</em> images support i386/amd64/powerpc and
	alpha/hppa/ia64 respectively; the installation is similar to installing
	from a single architecture netinst image.
    </li><li>
	The multi-arch <em>DVD</em> image supports i386/amd64; the
	installation is similar to installing from a single architecture full
	CD image; the DVD also includes the source for all included packages.
    </li><li>
	For the netinst and businesscard CD images, <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> and
	<tt>SHA1SUMS</tt> files	are available from the same directory as the
	images.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="errata-r0">Errata for release 6.0</h3>

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Some sparc systems cannot be installed using CD-ROM</dt>
	<dd>Debian installer for Squeeze does not include PATA kernel 
	drivers, which makes it impossible to complete the installation from 
	CD media on systems which require these drivers to access the CD-ROM 
	drive (for example, Ultra 10), as the installer will fail to detect 
	it. The problem may be worked around by netbooting the installer, 
	thus eliminating the need to access CD-ROM drive during installation. 
	<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/610906">#610906</a>.<br />
	This will be fixed on the next Squeeze point release (6.0.1).</dd>

	<dt>Possibly non-working detected USB braille devices</dt>
	<dd>When letting the Debian Installer detect a plugged USB braille
        device, the latter may end up showing only "screen not in text
        mode". This is due to a potential race between detection and frame
        buffer start. A workaround is to pass <tt>brltty</tt> on the kernel
        command line to force detection.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/611648">#611648</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>No network driver for Sparc T2+</dt>
	<dd>niu network driver, required by newer T2+ sparc systems is not 
	included in d-i, making it impossible to install on them using any 
	method which relies on early network setup. Driver is included in 
	kernel packages, so network is expected to operate normally after 
	installation is completed.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608516">#608516</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Systems using aty graphics cards may not boot the installer correctly</dt>
	<dd>
	Systems using aty graphics cards (for example, Ultra 10) may not 
	boot the installer correctly, with kernel freezing early in the boot 
	stage with last message "console [tty0] enabled, bootconsole 
	disabled". This is a kernel bug, for which a patch is available, 
	however it may be not fully fixed.<br />
	The issue may be worked around by adding a kernel boot parameter 
	'video=atyfb:off' to turn off the framebuffer during boot, which 
	allows the installer (and regular kernel) to be booted on such systems.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/609466">#609466</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Keyboard selection, with graphical installer, does not work for some layouts</dt>
	<dd>
	Preselection of keyboard is not working with graphical installations 
	for some combinations (Bulgaria, Swiss German, Sweden and Brazilian). 
	Also the choice made is not beind used, and the system 
	defaults to American English (/etc/default/keyboard).<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/610843">#610843</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Potential installation problems with RTL8169-based network cards</dt>
	<dd>The Debian installer may be unable to use network cards based 
	on the RTL8169 family during the installation, which includes 
	downloading packages during installation through these cards. 
	The installed system is unaffected by the problem.<br /> 
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/558316">#558316</a> and similar merged bugs.<br />
	This will be fixed on the next Squeeze point release (6.0.1).
	</dd>

	<dt>
	Fails to boot after successful install on a btrfs root</dt>
	<dd>The installation finishes as normal, but after reboot it results 
	into an initramfs busybox prompt.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608538">#608538</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Windows is not added to the grub list</dt>
	<dd>
	The Debian Installer detects Windows during installation but 
	it not adds it to the grub boot menu. As workaround, after installing, 
	run update-grub.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608025">#608025</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Makes incompatible partition table with Mac OS 9</dt>
	<dd>It was reported that the partitioning tool in the installer makes 
	the partition table unrecognizable by Mac OS 9 which no longer boots.
	Although the HFS+ partitions are compatible with Linux and Mac OS X it 
	is advised to take all precautions when installing on a machine with 
	Mac OS 9.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/604134">#604134</a>.	
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitioning fails on kFreeBSD</dt>
	<dd>
	There are reports of failing partitioning on kFreeBSD. 
	The problem seems to be related with partitions alignment / extended 
	partitions.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/593733">#593733</a>, 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/597088">#597088</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/602129">#602129</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Network/Graphic/Storage card doesn't work properly</dt>
	<dd>
	There is several hardware, notably network cards, graphic cards and 
	storage controllers, that require binary non-free firmware to work 
	properly.<br />
	Debian is commited to free software values and never make the system 
	require non-free software (see Debian's <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">
	Social Contract</a>). So, non-free firmware is not included in the 
	installer.<br />
	But if you want to load any external firmware during installation 
	you are free to do it. The process is documented in the installation manual.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>zipl installation problem that makes s390 uninstallable</dt>
	<dd>
	If a dedicated partition for the /boot directory is created system-boot
	fails after installation if /boot is mounted before /.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/519254">#519254</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>
	
<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitions overs 16TiB not supported by ext4</dt>
	<dd>
	The ext4 file system creation tools do not support creating file
	systems over 16TiB in size.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
