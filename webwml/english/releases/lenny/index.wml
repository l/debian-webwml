released <current_release_date_lenny>. The release included many major

the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a>.</p>

<if-stable-release release="squeeze">

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there may be some problems that exist in the
release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
