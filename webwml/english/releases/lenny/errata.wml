<toc-add-entry name="security">Security issues</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in <q>lenny</q>.</p>

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ lenny/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="pointrelease">Point releases</toc-add-entry>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

#<ul>
#  <li>The first point release, 4.0r1, was released on
#      <a href="$(HOME)/News/2007/20070817">August 15, 2007</a>.</li>
#</ul>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the

dists/lenny-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.</p>

the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
