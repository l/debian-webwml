### While lenny is stable, we can reuse the tags defined in
### templates/debian/release_images.wml.
### When the website gets prepared for the next stable release,
### the tags should be defined here instead (see previous releases
### for examples).
### Note that images for the new oldstable release will be moved to
### cdimage/archive at the time of the release!

## Next line should be changed to 'wml::debian::installer' when
## preparing for next stable release; don't forget the Makefile!
