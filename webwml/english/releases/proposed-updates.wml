#use wml::debian::template title="The <q>proposed-updates</q> mechanism"
#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/releases/info"

<p>All changes to the released, <q>stable</q> distribution go through
an extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
Each such update of the stable release is called a <q>point release</q>.</p>

<p>Preparation of point releases is done through the <q>proposed-updates</q>
mechanism. Updated packages are uploaded to a separate queue called
<code><var>codename</var>-proposed-updates</code>, and are made available
through a separate directory of any Debian archive mirror. For example,
the proposed-updates directory for <em><current_release_name></em> is called
<a href="http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/<current_release_name>-proposed-updates/">\
<current_release_name>-proposed-updates</a>.</p>

<p>To use these packages with APT, you can add the following lines to your
<code>sources.list</code> file:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed updates for the next point release
  deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian <current_release_name>-proposed-updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Note that <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">any /debian/ mirror</a> will
have this, it is not necessary to use any particular one, the above choice
of ftp.us.debian.org is just an example.</p>

<p>New packages can arrive into proposed-updates when Debian developers
upload them either to the specific proposed-updates queue, or the
<q>stable</q> distribution. Debian's Stable Release Managers (SRM)
 regularly review the packages in proposed-updates and decide whether
to accept or reject them.</p>

<p>It should be noted that packages from
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security.debian.org</a> are copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. At the same time, packages
that are uploaded directly to proposed-updates are not monitored by
the Debian security team.</p>

<p>The current list of packages that are in the proposed-updates queue
can be seen at <url "http://ftp-master.debian.org/proposed-updates.html">.</p>
