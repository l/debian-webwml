#use wml::debian::template title="The <q>proposed-updates</q> mechanism"

<p>All changes to the released, <q>stable</q> (and <q>oldstable</q>)
distribution go through an extended testing period before they are accepted
into the archive. Each such update of the stable (oldstable) release is called
a <q>point release</q>.</p>

<p>Preparation of point releases is done through the <q>proposed-updates</q>
mechanism. Updated packages are uploaded to a separate queue called
<code>p-u-new</code> (<code>o-p-u-new</code>), before they are accepted in 
<q>proposed-updates</q> (<q>oldstable-proposed-updates</q>).
</p>

<p>To use these packages with APT, you can add the following lines to your
<code>sources.list</code> file:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed updates for the next point release
  deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian <current_release_name>-proposed-updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Note that <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">the /debian/ mirrors</a> will
have this, it is not necessary to use this particular one, the above choice
of ftp.us.debian.org is just an example.</p>

<p>New packages can arrive into proposed-updates when Debian developers
upload them either to <q>proposed-updates</q> (<q>oldstable-proposed-updates</q>),
or to <q>stable</q> (<q>oldstable</q>). Debian's Stable Release Team
 regularly reviews the packages in p-u-new (o-p-u-new) and decide whether
to accept or reject them.</p>

<p>It should be noted that packages from
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security.debian.org</a> are copied into the
p-u-new (o-p-u-new) directory automatically. At the same time, packages
that are uploaded directly to proposed-updates (oldstable-proposed-updates) are
not monitored by the Debian security team.</p>

<p>The current list of packages that are in the p-u-new (o-p-u-new) queue
can be seen at <url "http://release.debian.org/proposed-updates/stable.html">
(<url "http://release.debian.org/proposed-updates/oldstable.html">).</p>

<p>Before uploading a package to <q>proposed-updates</q> (<q>oldstable-proposed-updates</q>)
it would be appreciated if one goes through the following checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>bug(s) one wants to fix in the upload is (are) filed in the BTS</li>
<li>the fixes for the bugs have been thoroughly tested at least in sid</li>
<li>patches 
  <ul>
  <li>fix a security issue, or</li>
  <li>fix a critical bug, or</li>
  <li>fix an installability, an FTBFS bug, or</li>
  <li>bring architectures back in sync</li>
  </ul></li>
<li>mail is sent to debian-release@lists.debian.org explaining why these bugs
should be fixed in stable (oldstable) via a point release and include a diff
against the version in stable/proposed-updates (oldstable/oldstable-proposed-updates)</li>
</ul>
<p>
In case of doubt or questions, don't hesitate to contact the Stable Release Team,
your case might always be an exception to the general rules of the above checklist!
