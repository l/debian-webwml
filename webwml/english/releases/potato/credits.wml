<h2>Release management</h2>

<p>This release of Debian was managed by Richard Braakman and Anthony Towns.

<h2>Installation System</h2>

<p>Many Debian developers, translators, documenters, testers, and
users have contributed to the development of the installation system
-- too many to mention, in fact.  Adam Di Carlo was the maintainer of
the boot-floppies during the period of the Potato release.  Other
significant contributors can be found in the <code>Maintainers</code>
file of the <code>boot-floppies</code> package.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bill Bennet, The ComputerHelperGuy, for his donation of
Potato <a href="http://www.chguy.net/potato.html">official CDs</a> to
the Debian boot-floppies team.</p>

<h2>The rest of Debian</h2>

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/devel/people">developers</a> and everyone else
who contributed.</p>
