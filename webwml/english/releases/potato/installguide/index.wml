<H3>by Mark Stone</H3>

<P><em><strong>Note</strong>: this is <strong>not</strong> the official
<A HREF="../installmanual">Installation manual for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
(`potato')</A>.</em>

<P>Hamm. Slink. Potato. Woody. No, you aren't watching "Toy Story". You've
encountered the lineage of Debian distributions. Whether your aim is to
expel the evil operating system Zurg from your computer, or find a way to
peacefully co-exist with it, you'll find that the current stable release of
Debian, aka Potato, is the easiest Debian to work with yet.

<P>Traditionally Debian and Red Hat have contrasted as Linux distributions:
Red Hat is reputed to be easier to install, while Debian is reputed to be
easier to maintain and upgrade once installed. While that distinction still
holds true, Debian is now much easier to install.

<P>We aren't going to take you through all the intricacies of Debian in
this article. What we are going to do is show you how to set up a dual boot
machine that will enable you to run either Windows or Debian GNU/Linux, and
we're going to show you how to do the kind of simple install a beginner
would want to play around with Linux and get a feel for how the system
works.

<P>We're going to go through several stages here:

<OL>
  <LI>Documenting your system;
  <LI>Preparing your hard drive;
  <LI>Installing the base Debian system;
  <LI>Selecting and installing packages;
  <li>Configuring the system;
  <li>A brief glimpse at Debian upgrading.
</ol>

<P>Debian can be installed from floppy disks if absolutely necessary; we're
going to assume, however, that you have a Debian Potato CD.  Debian can be
installed on a wide range of systems, from old 486 computers to modern
non-Intel architectures. A full install of every possible Debian package
would run several Gigs; some versions of Linux can fit on a single floppy.
The range of possibilities with Linux is wide. We're going to assume,
however, a typical profile.  We'll assume that you have an existing machine
running Windows 98, with adequate hardware to do so. We'll assume you have a
current Pentium processor, at least 64 megs of RAM, video card that will
support true color in at least 1024x768, a CDROM drive, a modem, and an
ample hard drive (we'll use 10 Gig in this example).

<P>Finally, we'll assume that you don't want to eliminate Windows just yet,
but want to set up your machine so that you can select either Windows or
Linux at start up, i.e. at boot time. This kind of setup is called a dual
boot machine.

<P>Remember, no guide to installation covers everything. But remember also
you're not alone. The #linuxhelp irc channel on irc.freenode.net is an
excellent place to look for help, as is #linux.com-live! Be sure to check
Linux.com's Live! calendar for upcoming irc-based installfests. In fact, in
this article was made possible by the outstanding answers that came in over
IRC during the installfest done over IRC at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo
this past August.

<h3>Documenting Your System</h3>

<P>Linux does an excellent job these days of autoprobing your system to
determine what hardware you have, and what settings that hardware is
configured for. Sometimes, however, Linux does need help, and there are
occasions where you'll find that you have some component not yet supported
by Linux. To anticipate these contingencies, and to know what to do about
them, it's important to document exactly what you have on your machine.

<P>Here's a suitable checklist of the various system components you'll want
to know about ahead of time:

<table>

  <tr>
    <th>Device</th>
    <th>Information Needed</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Hard Drive(s)</td>
    <td>Number, size, and type of each hard drive.  Which hard drive is
    recognized by your computer as first, second, and so on.  Which adapter
    type (IDE or SCSI) is used by each drive.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>RAM</td>
    <td>The amount of installed RAM</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>CDROM Drive(s)</td>
    <td>Which adapter type (IDE or SCSI) is used by each drive.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>SCSI Adapter (if any)</td>
    <td>Make and model of the card.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Network Adapter (if any)</td>
    <td>Make and model of the card.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Mouse</td>
    <td>Type (PS/2, USB, serial, or bus).  Protocol (Microsoft, Logitech,
    MouseMan, etc.).  If serial, the port to which it's connected.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Video Adapter</td>
    <td>Make and model of the card.  Amount of video RAM.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Monitor</td>
    <td>Highest color depth and screen resolution the monitor supports
    under Windows.  Horizontal and vertical refresh rates.</td>
  </tr>


  <tr>
    <td>Modem (if any)</td>
    <td>If external, the serial port to which it's connected.</td>
  </tr>

</table>


<P>Windows can actually provide you with most of the information you need
about your system. Select Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Control Panel -&gt;
System.  You should see something like:

<P><a href="deb.0201.png"><img src="deb.0201-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Most of the information you want will be found in the Device Manager.
Selecting that tab should bring up a window like this:

<P><a href="deb.0202.png"><img src="deb.0202-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>This will show you which devices are installed on your system. Selecting
a device, and clicking on the "Properties" button will show you the
settings for that device.

<h3>Preparing Your Hard Drive</h3>

Bill Gates once said, "640k of RAM ought to be enough for anyone." It's
that kind of forward-looking view of the world that gives us a peculiar DOS
contrivance now turned into a useful tool: the disk partition. DOS, Windows
3.1, and even the initial release of Windows 95 had limitations on how much
hard drive space they could recognize. If a drive were larger than this
recognizable limit (2 Gigs under Windows 95, I believe), then the operating
system simply couldn't "see" the rest of the drive.

<P>To work around this limitation, drives could be formatted into logically
separated segments, called partitions. Once formatted in this way, each
partition was treated by the operating system as if it were a separate hard
drive. Under Windows, if you started with hard drive C:, and partitioned
this, the first partition would appear as C:, and the second partition
would appear as D:.

<P>We'll exploit this construct to leave one partition formatted as a
Windows partition, and to create a second partition formatted as a Linux
partition on which to install Debian GNU/Linux.

<P>Windows 98 can recognize large disk sizes, so these days
most computers ship with a hard drive formatted as a single partition. This
means that you'll need to:

<OL>
  <LI>defragment your hard drive;
  <li>resize the existing partition to fill only part of the drive, and
  <LI>add a second partition on the newly freed up space.
</ol>

<P>The trick is to resize your Windows partition without destroying any of
the data. This used to be an arduous task. These days it is fairly
straightforward using a simple tool called GNU Parted. Here's what we're
going to do:

<OL>
  <LI>Create a boot floppy disk containing the absolute minimal Linux
  components needed to run Parted;
  <LI>Boot your computer with this floppy disk;
  <li>Run Parted to shrink your Windows partition;
  <LI>Reboot the computer and start the Debian installation.
</ol>

<P>Resizing your hard drive nondestructively will be easiest, and least
likely to cause problems, if you defragment your hard drive first.  Windows
doesn't store all files in contiguous sectors on your disk. As a result,
files can end up scattered across a much larger portion of your hard drive
than the amount of drive space you're actually using.  Defragmenting simply
packs all sectors being used as efficiently as possible onto the beginning
of your hard drive.

<P>You can use Windows' native defragmenting tool by selecting Start -&gt;
Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Utilities -&gt; Disk Utilities.
More effective defragmentation programs come with utility suites like Norton
Utilities.

<h3>Creating a Parted Boot Floppy</h3>

<P>Initially, your hard drive will look something like this if you select
My Computer -&gt; C: -&gt; Properties:

<P><a href="01win98.png"><img src="01win98-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>To create the Parted floppy, you'll need:

<OL>
  <LI>a blank floppy disk,
  <LI>the Parted disk image,
  <li>a program for writing raw files to disk called Rawrite.
</ol>

<P>You can get the Parted disk image from <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/">http://www.gnu.org/software/parted/</a>.
It's the file ending in the .img extension. There should be a copy of
Rawrite on your Debian CD. If you can't find it, you can always download it
from <a
href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/">ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/</a>.

<P>When you run rawrite it will prompt you for the source file; give it the
path to where you've downloaded the Parted disk image. This will be
something like "C:\Windows\Desktop\parted.img". It will then prompt you for
the target location, meaning your floppy drive. Enter in "A:".

<P>Now simply reboot your computer with this floppy disk in the drive.

<h3>Running Parted</h3>

<P>When this floppy boots, you'll see a lot of unfamiliar messages scroll
by that are a routine part of the Linux boot process. You'll eventually
come to a command line prompt, something reminiscent of running DOS, and
you'll see a message that says "You can run parted by typing 'parted
DEVICE' where device is the name of the drive you wish to partition."

<P>Linux has a different naming scheme for disk drives. All devices,
including disk drives, are listed in a directory called "/dev". IDE hard
drives -- the most common type -- start with the letters "hd". The first
hard drive will be "a", the second "b", and so on.  Each partition on a
drive gets a number, starting with "1". So Linux would refer to the first
partition on your first hard drive as "/dev/hda1", and would refer to the
whole first hard drive as "/dev/hda".

<P>The command we're looking for, assuming you have an IDE drive, is:
parted /dev/hda.

<P>This will bring you to a new command line with a prompt like this:

<P><tt> (parted) </tt>

<P>If you hit enter, type "?", or type "help" at this point, you'll get a
list of all the parted commands, like this:

<P><a href="01parted.png"><img src="01parted-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Let's assume we want to shrink our partition down from 10 Gigs to, say,
4 Gigs. Then we want to resize minor partition number 1, starting at the
beginning, and ending at 4000. The command would look like this:

<P><tt> (parted) resize 1 0 4000 </tt>

<P>That's all you have to do.

<P>You may see some warning messages appear when running parted that have
to do with either small discrepancies in the way Windows and Linux measure
disk size, or that have to do with moving Windows system files.  In our
experience, these warnings can safely be ignored.

<P>If you reboot your computer at this point, Windows 98 will come up just
as before, and all your programs and files will be intact. The only
difference you'll notice is that Windows now thinks it has a smaller hard
drive:

<P><a href="06win98.png"><img src="06win98-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You're now ready to start installing Debian.

<h3>Installing the Base Debian System</h3>

<P>Most computers today have a BIOS configured to support bootable CDs.  If
your computer supports bootable CDs, then all you need to do is insert the
Debian Potato CD in the drive, and reboot your computer.

<P>If your computer does not support bootable CDs, then you'll need to
create a Debian boot floppy. You'll use the same Rawrite program you used
to create the parted floppy. You just need to point Rawrite at the Debian
boot floppy image instead. You'll find this on the Debian CD. The path
should be something like D:\foo.

<P>Make sure your Debian CD is in the CDROM drive. Whether booting from the
CD, or a boot floppy, you should see a startup screen like this:

<P><a href="11debian.png"><img src="11debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>At this point you can simply hit enter. Indeed, you'll be prompted on
several basic points about your system at the beginning of the install, for
which it's generally safe to select the default by hitting enter.

<P>You'll find that Debian's install script uses a few simple conventions
for navigation. This is a curses-based installation script.  That's a fancy
way of saying that the script uses the full screen, and has the concept of
a cursor, but not the concept of a mouse. "Curses" is the library within
Linux that provides this capability. On any given screen you can usually
navigate between selections by using the tab key, or the up or down arrow
keys. Hitting enter makes a particular selection.

<P>You'll also find that Debian's install script will repeatedly ask you
what medium you want to install from, and which sources you want to install
from that medium. For purposes of this article, we will always be
installing from CD, and we will always be installing from the <b>stable
main archive</b>. If you find this repeated query for the same information
annoying, you're not alone. Just remember that this structure does give
Debian the capability to mix and match between install sources, a
flexibility you'll appreciate if you ever have to install without a CD.

<P>Once you start the actual install, you'll see the Release Notes:

<P><a href="09debian.png"><img src="09debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You'll be asked to select your keyboard type (English, QWERTY, most
likely):

<P><a href="10debian.png"><img src="10debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>The first point where you'll have to provide more than default
information will be with partitioning. You'll be presented with the option
to partition a hard drive:

<P><a href="11debian.png"><img src="11debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>What the heck is LILO? You'll wonder this at several points in the
install; this is the first point where this question comes up. LILO is the
"LInux LOader", the program that actually will be managing your computer's
boot process after Linux installation is complete.  Boot loaders reside on
a special sector on the hard drive known as the Master Boot Record. Your
BIOS knows to pass control to whatever program is in the MBR when the BIOS
has finished with its tasks. It is up to the MBR program to know where to
find the boot code for the operating system on your hard drive.

<P>We'll be replacing the Windows boot process with LILO. We do this
because the Windows boot process only knows how to boot Windows. LILO, on
the other hand, knows how to boot between any of several operating systems,
including both Linux and Windows.

<P>So when asked if we want to make Linux bootable from the hard drive, or
when asked if we want to install LILO on the MBR, we'll always want to say
yes.

<P>Debian's install will take you from here into a program called cfdisk.
cfdisk, like parted, is used for creating partitions. cfdisk's command line
interface even looks somewhat like parted:

<P><a href="13debian.png"><img src="13debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You'll need to create two partitions. One of these will be a regular
Linux partition, on which Debian will be installed. The other will be a
swap partition. A swap partition simple means disk space to which
information stored in RAM can be temporarily moved when the system needs to
free up RAM. Think of it as using the hard drive as an emergency RAM
supplement.

<P>Create the swap partition first, and put it after the Windows partition
on your disk. In cfdisk this means using the arrow keys to move the cursor
down to the area marked free space, and then using the tab key to move
through the commands at the bottom of the screen until you reach the "new"
command. Then hit enter.

<P>This will bring up a menu of file system types, where each entry on the
menu has a name and hexadecimal number associated with it. You select a
file system type by entering the appropriate hexadecimal number. Note that
the menu is actually two screens long, and that you can get to the second
screen by hitting the space bar.  Linux swap is on the second screen, and
has number 82 associated with it:

<P><a href="15debian.png"><img src="15debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Asking two Linux gurus what size to make a swap partition is akin to
asking a Red Sox and a Yankees fan what the best team in baseball is.
Religious wars have started over less contentious topics. Our opinion, and
we know that other views vary, is that your swap space should be twice the
amount of RAM you have up to a maximum of 128 Megs of swap.  So if your
computer has 128 Megs of RAM, make swap 128 Megs. If your computer has 32
Megs of RAM, make swap 64 Megs. And so on.

<P>Once you've added the swap partition, you'll need to again toggle down
to the free space listing, and select new. Now you'll be creating a regular
Linux partition (hex number 83) to fill the remainder of your hard drive.

<P>Once you've created these new partitions, you need to explicitly write
the partition table to your hard drive. Otherwise, these changes will not
take effect. So write the partition table, and then exit cfdisk.

<P>You'll be returned to the Debian install script. You'll be asked if you
want to initialize a swap partition, and you should say yes.

<P>You'll then be asked if you want to initialize a Linux partition.  You
should say yes.  This means that you're going to create a directory on the
file system where your Linux partition where be mounted, in other words a
directory where information on that partition can be accessed. You'll want
to make this the root directory: "/". You'll be asked about 2.0 file system
compatibility.  The choice is not critical here, but unless you're
upgrading an older Linux system, there's no reason to worry about
maintaining older compatibility:

<P><a href="19debian.png"><img src="19debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>When the install script initializes a partition, it will ask you if you
want to perform a bad block scan. This is basically a physical check of the
disk surface for areas that are damaged or otherwise unusable. There
shouldn't be any, and a block scan will probably be the most time consuming
step in the install process, especially on a large hard drive. You should
do this scan anyway. Performing this one time at setup will enable Linux to
write data only to safe areas of the disk in the future. It's a one-time
hassle with a lot of benefit.

<P>Notice that Debian generally presents you with a default choice for next
step in the install process, and an alternate choice. We'll almost always
be selecting the defaults. Once you've initialized your Linux partition,
however, we want to select an alternative: mount a previously initialized
partition.

<P>Linux is capable of reading and writing information in the Windows VFAT
file system format. This means that we can access information on the
Windows partition of the hard drive even when we're running Linux. But to
facilitate this capability, we'll need to initialize the Windows partition.

<P>So select "mount a previously initialized partition" and create a
directory name where your Windows partition will be accessed. A name like
"/win98" or "/windows" will do just fine.

<P>You'll now need to install the operating system kernel and modules.  For
a great many systems you'll be able to simply select the defaults here.
We're assuming a CD install:

<P><a href="22debian.png"><img src="22debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Configuring device driver modules will be necessary if you have a
network card, a sound card, a printer, or other devices besides the base
hardware of your system. For example, if you want printer support, you'll
find the printer module under miscellaneous modules. You'd select
miscellaneous, scroll down the module list until you see "lp", and select
that module to be installed. You'll be prompted to enter parameters, but
for most modules the parameters can be auto-detected, so no parameters need
be entered. You should see an "installation succeeded" message, in which
case you can return to the modules menu and install other modules as
needed.

<P>If you get an "installation failed" message you'll need to look up the
<b>I/O memory address</b> and <b>IRQ settings</b> for that device in your
system. This information should be on the checklist you prepared ahead of
time. You might find, for example, that to get a particular ethernet card
recognized you need to explicitly enter in something like:

<P><tt> io=0x280 irq=7 </tt>

<P>Configuring and tuning your kernel and modules, though, is an intricate
process you'll probably want to investigate after you have your system up
and running. It's beyond the scope of this article, but it is a topic we
cover in depth elsewhere.  In fact, it was the subject of our Linux.com
Live! event at Atlanta Linux Showcase this fall.

<P>The install script next presents you with a simple menu to select the
time zone in which you reside.

<P>You'll next be asked whether you want to set your system clock to local
time or Greenwich Meridian Time (GMT). Windows has difficulty understanding
GMT, so on a dual boot machine you'll probably want to select local time.
The exception to this would be on a laptop, where you'll have problems
keeping the clock straight in suspend mode unless you use GMT.

<P>The install script will then present you with some options about how to
set up the boot configurations for your computer. We're assuming this will
be a dual boot machine with LILO managing the boot process that will let
you choose between booting Windows and Linux. Dual boot can be handled in
other ways, but this is the most straightforward approach. So have LILO
installed on the Master Boot Record for the hard drive, not just the boot
sector for the partition.

<P>You'll be asked whether or not you want to make a boot floppy disk. This
is a good precaution, even though you'll normally be booting directly from
the hard drive. In the event of problems -- we've seen Norton Antivirus
treat LILO as a virus, for example -- you'll be able to boot the system and
make corrections using the boot floppy.

<P>The system will reboot at this point. Be sure to remove your Debian CD
before reboot, or the install script will start over from the beginning.

<P>Linux is a secure, multi-user operating system. This means that you must
explicitly log on to the system to use it, and you must do so as a
particular user (no, you cannot do the Windows trick of simply hitting the
escape key when confronted with a user name/password logon prompt).
Different users on a Linux system have different privileges. One user, the
"root" user, has all privileges, while end users have more restricted
capabilities. End user accounts are typically set up to enable users to run
programs, view and edit files, but to deny users the ability to modify
system configurations or install new programs that would have system wide
impact.

<P>This stage of the installation script will take you through the basics
of setting up users and password security. At a minimum you must create the
root user. We strongly advise that you log in as root only when you have
system maintenance to perform. You should create an ordinary end user
account that you will use for your daily activity. Not only will this make
your system more secure, but it will spare you the flames and taunting of
more experienced Linux users who cringe every time they see "root@" in an
email header or IRC host.

<P>Originally Unix passwords were stored encrypted in a plain text file
readable by anyone (this is /etc/passwd on your system). Today Linux relies
on further levels of encryption to ensure password security. You'll be
prompted about two possible such systems to use. MD5 is one:

<P><a href="30debian.png"><img src="30debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Shadow passwords is the other:

<P><a href="31debian.png"><img src="31debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Our personal preference is to use shadow passwords and not MD5, but
opinions on this matter vary widely. The main point is that you should
install at least one of these two.

<P>You'll next be asked to choose a password for the root user:

<P><a href="32debian.png"><img src="32debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>The screen will not display what you type, but you will be prompted to
retype it in order to verify that you typed what you think you did.

<P>Proper password selection is another of those topics that can inspire
debates of near religious fanaticism among Linux users. Bear in mind that
most PCs today are easily capable of grinding through every word in the
dictionary, or even a combination of two or three words, in an automated
process of password guessing. Chain together several PCs working on a
security exploit, or a more powerful computer, and devising an unguessable
password becomes a serious challenge.

<P>There are some simple guidelines to follow. Unlike some passwords, Linux
passwords are case sensitive. Use this to your advantage, and include a mix
of upper and lower case characters. You can -- and should -- also include
numbers and punctuation. The result should be something that does not
contain any English language words, but should also be something you can
easily remember, and that someone who knows you could not readily guess.

<P>Here are a couple of examples:

<UL>
  <LI>If you had a dog named "Rascal" who lived to be 12 years old, you
  might combine the name and age, substituting "@" for the letter "a", and
  modifying the capitalization, to get something like "r@sc@L12" as a
  password.
  <LI>If you met your wife on a vacation in Paris in 1996, you might join
  "Paris" and "96" with a smiley, only spelling Paris backwards, to get
  something like this: "siraP:)96"
</ul>

<P>You'll next be prompted to create an ordinary user account:

<P><a href="33debian.png"><img src="33debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>We strongly recommend that you do this. You should use the same security
guidelines in selecting a user password as you do in selecting a root
password, and do not make them the same password.

<P>You'll next be prompted about the need for PCMCIA modules:

<P><a href="34debian.png"><img src="34debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You'll need this only if you're doing a laptop install <i>and</i> your
CDROM drive is attached to the laptop via a PCMCIA card.

<h3>Selecting and Installing Packages</h3>

<P>An operating system is nothing without applications to run on top of it.
Debian applications are stored in packages that contain information
necessary for the Debian package management system, dpkg, to keep track of
all the packages and package dependencies on your system.

<P>The front end to dpkg is a program called apt. Apt needs to know a
little about what you want to install, and from where. So you'll be asked
to select the install source for apt:

<P><a href="35debian.png"><img src="35debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Apt is a vital part of any Debian system, and a device you'll grow to
appreciate as your system evolves. You'll note that one of the options for
apt configuration is http. This will enable you to point apt at the Debian
website, and, assuming you're connected to the Internet at the time,
install or update a package simply by issuing the "apt-get install" or
"apt-get upgrade" command. The rest of the process should, and usually
does, work seamlessly in the background.

<P>For now, however, you'll want to direct apt at your CDROM drive as the
source for packages.  Once we've completed installation and made a couple
of modifications at the end, you can reconfigure apt to point to a Debian
website mirror, giving you an easy online method for upgrading and
modifying your system.

<P>You'll next be asked to choose between simple and advanced
configurations:

<P><a href="36debian.png"><img src="36debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Especially if you are new to Linux, but even if you are new to just
Debian, you really want to pick "simple". The simple installation means
you'll be doing somewhat more work with apt after installation to add
additional packages or remove some unwanted ones, but this is a relatively
minor amount of additional overhead. The "advanced" install will take you
directly to Debian's older install method, dselect.  Unless you enjoy
scanning through several thousand package descriptions using an obtuse text
based interface, we recommend you avoid dselect.

<P>The simple install takes you to a menu that lets you select groups of
related packages to install:

<P><a href="37debian.png"><img src="37debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You can get an exact listing of the packages selected by moving the
cursor to a package group and entering "i". This brings up an informational
screen with a more detailed description of the group, and a listing of each
package in the group.

<P>We recommend selecting any package associated with Gnome, and any
package associated with the X Window System. This will give you an
easy-to-use graphical workstation with great Internet capabilities, which
is exactly what most users are looking for.

<P>Traditionally one of the most challenging parts of Linux installation
has been the X Window System, usually referred to simply as X. X is what
frees you from the command line and gives you a modern graphical interface
in which to work. Getting X to function properly, however, requires proper
configuration to coordinate your video card with your monitor.

<P>These days X configuration is a greatly simplified task. Indeed, if you
have a graphics card well supported by Linux, and a well-documented
monitor, then Debian's configuration tool, anXious, should be able to walk
you through the process with no trouble:

<P><a href="38debian.png"><img src="38debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>With a 17" or greater monitor, and a recent video card, you should be
able to achieve very high resolutions (perhaps 1600 x 1200 pixels) and true
color depth (32 bits per pixel, or bpp). Don't be disappointed if you can't
tune your system to this level of performance initially, however. You'll
get a usable amount of screen real estate and high quality screen color if
you can get 1024 x 768 pixels, and 16 bpp.

<P>X configuration is a subtle and complex topic, one worthy of an article
in its own right. We'll be bringing you that article soon. Here we'll walk
you through the steps involved if you know what video card and monitor you
have, you know the settings for your monitor, and both are well-supported
under Linux.

<P>AnXious will probe for your video card, and report what it finds. It
will then ask you to install fonts. Unless you're short on disk space,
install both 75dpi and 100dpi fonts. You'll be asked about a terminal
emulator. The default choice of xterm should be fine, and in fact you won't
need a terminal program for the balance of this installation.

<P>By itself, X does very little other than provide the capability to
render graphics on screen. The actual drawing of windows, menus, and icons,
and the management of those graphical objects, is done by a program called
a window manager. A simple but popular choice is Window Maker, indicated on
the install script here by wmaker. We'll assume you've made that selection
later in this article.

<P>Many Linux users boot their systems directly to the command line
interface, and go to X only as needed. This may be a bit of a shock for
Windows users used to a full time graphical environment. We recommend,
therefore, that you install xdm, the X Display Manager, which will start X
automatically for you and bring you to a graphical logon prompt when you
start the system.

<P>You'll next be prompted for mouse type. The most common type today is
PS/2, and unless you know otherwise, that's probably what you should enter.
If your mouse has only two buttons, you can opt for three button emulation.
This will make holding both buttons down simultaneously emulate the effects
of clicking on a third button.

<P>If you've selected PS/2 as your mouse type, then the Linux device for
that will be /dev/psaux. You should enter this information when prompted.

<P>Probably you have a standard US keyboard, and should enter that
selection accordingly.

<P>You're next going to be prompted for several pieces of information about
your monitor and video card. Be sure you have that documentation handy, and
enter accordingly. For vertical and horizontal synch ranges, pick the range
that most closely fits your specs, or select "custom" and enter the exact
range from your monitor documentation. Enter in the appropriate memory
value for your card. You're unlikely to need a clockchip setting with
today's video cards, so enter "none" at this prompt, and at the next prompt
do not probe for clock settings.

<P>You should try to set the default color depth to 32 bpp, as this will
give you "true color" (to use the Windows term) graphics. You'll want a
default resolution of at least 1024x768, and should probably pick a higher
resolution. Note that if your computer can't actually support the color
depth and resolution you select, it will opt out to the highest supported
settings it can find.  So a bit of guesswork here won't do you any harm.
Just make sure that 1024x768, 800x600, and 640x480 are selected as
"supported resolutions".

<P>You'll next be prompted to create the X configuration file. If all has
gone well, X should be successfully configured and ready to install at this
point, with Window Maker set up as your default window manager.

<P>At this point the install script has all the information it needs to
begin setting up your system. There are a couple of package specific
configuration questions you'll be asked, but at this stage your computer
will begin churning away at package installation:

<P><a href="39debian.png"><img src="39debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>This process will take anywhere from ten minutes to an hour or more,
depending on the speed of your processor, amount of RAM, and available swap
space. A machine of recent Pentium vintage with at least 64 Megs of RAM
should be able to complete this stage in less than half an hour.

<P>You'll be prompted to answer a few questions along the way, and the only
series of questions that requires anything other than the default answer is
mail configuration. Debian uses a program called exim as its default mail
handler. To understand the significance of these questions, you'll need to
understand a little about how email works.

<P>Email requires three separate functions: it must be <b>transferred</b>
from the system of origin to the destination; it must be <b>distributed</b>
on the destination system to the correct user; and it must be <b>viewed</b>
by an email client. Some programs perform more than one of these functions.
Netscape, for example, can be not only an email client, but also used to
retrieve mail from a server, meaning it can do some of the transfer and
distribution work. Linux has several programs, like Fetchmail and
Popclient, that can also be used to retrieve mail, and numerous email
clients, like Elm, Pine, and Mutt.  Most clients (Pine is the exception)
need to know of a mail server when sending mail that they can hand mail off
to for transfer. Typically your ISP has such a server and provides you
information about using it when you sign up for your dial-up account.

<P>Exim is a mail transfer agent. It knows how to transfer mail to, and
receive mail from, another mail server. It also knows how to distribute
mail to users on a system. While exim isn't strictly necessary on a Debian
machine connected to the Internet by dial-up, it nonetheless makes a useful
backup for an ISP's shortcomings, and it helps when other programs you
might install assume you have a functioning mail transfer agent installed.
So setting up exim isn't absolutely required, but it is a very good idea.

<P>You'll be presented with five general choices for exim configuration.
Note that option 2 says "this is probably what you want for a dialup
machine." Select this option.

<P>For visible mail name, other names, relaying, IPv6 support, and RBL
support you can simply choose the defaults.

<P>You'll be prompted for a smart host. This is your ISP's mail server. If
your ISP is "foo", this will probably be something like smtp.foo.com, or
mail.foo.com.

<P>For postmaster-mail enter "none". This is not an ideal choice, but until
you're more familiar with Debian it will spare you from having your mailbox
filled with arcane system mail.

<P>You'll be asked to confirm the choices you've made. That's it. The rest
of package installation should proceed without a hitch until you're
prompted about X servers. Say "no" to the vga server as the default, and
"yes" to the svga server as the default.

<P>When you see the message "Press enter to continue" you've completed
package installation.


<h3>Configuring the System</h3>

<P>What do you do now?

<P>Relax. You've now completed your installation of Debian. You have a
fully functioning version of Debian GNU/Linux on your computer. Of course
you have a little configuring left to do, to make the system do the things
you want. Specifically, we're assuming that this is a dual boot system to
be connected to the Internet by dial-up.  So we'll need to configure the
boot process to recognize Windows and give you a choice of boot options.
And we'll need to set up and configure a dial-up program so you can connect
to your ISP. The latter will also give us a look at how package
installation and upgrade works.

<P>What you're being presented with is a login prompt. Normally you'd log
in as an ordinary user to do routine tasks. Right now, however, we want to
perform system maintenance, so you should log in with user name "root" and
the root password you selected during installation.

<P>System configuration in Linux is accomplished using plain text files.
Most of these files reside in the /etc directory. Tinkering with
configuration is a matter of editing these files, which means you'll have
to familiarize yourself with a text editor. For experienced Linux users,
this usually means settling on one of the venerable workhorse editing
programs, either emacs or vi. Experienced Linux users also get comfortable
using a terminal window and working from the command line. A terminal
window, such as xterm, eterm, or gnome-terminal, opens up a window to the
command line interface within X's graphical environment.  Think of it as
like opening up a DOS shell in Windows.

<P>Beginners, however, may want something a little simpler. In fact you can
accomplish all the basic system management tasks you're likely to need to
do with just three very familiar-looking tools: GMC, Gnome-run, and
Gnotepad.

<P>Most Windows users are familiar with point and click graphical editors,
and Linux has these too. If you've followed all the install steps up to
this point, you should have the Gnotepad editor installed; it will present
an interface very much like Windows Wordpad or Notepad.

<P>Most Windows users are also familiar with the "run" box off of the
Windows "Start" menu. This opens up a dialog box that lets you run a single
Windows command. Gnome-run provides this same capability within X.

<P>Finally, most Windows users are familiar with Windows Explorer as a
simple point-and-click file navigation program. GMC provides this same
style of interface as a file manager within X.

<P>Available programs under X can be accessed from a menu, just as in
Windows. Instead of anchoring that menu to a "start" button, however,
you'll access the menu by pointing the cursor at the desktop and clicking
once with the right mouse button.

<P>Under Apps -&gt; Tools you'll find GMC. Under XShells you'll find
gnome-run. Once GMC is running, you can edit a file by putting the cursor
over the icon for that file, clicking once on the right mouse button,
selecting "open with" from the resulting menu, and then selecting gnotepad
from the application list.

<P>To set up your system for dual boot, run GMC. Select the folder marked
"etc" and find the file icon for a file called "lilo.conf" in the right
hand window of GMC:

<P><a href="63debian.png"><img src="63debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>Right click on this icon, and select "copy" from the menu. This should
bring up a dialog box with "/etc" in it. Append this to read
"/etc/lilo.old", and click OK.

<P>You've now made a backup copy of lilo.conf, the configuration file that
LILO uses to determine how to boot your system. This is an important step.
We're about to modify that file, and should anything go wrong, you can
restore the original version from backup.

<P>Now once again find the lilo.conf icon and right click on it.  This time
select "open with" and select Gnotepad from the application list.  This
will open up lilo.conf for editing in Gnotepad:

<P><a href="65debian.png"><img src="65debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>What we have to do is actually quite simple. We need to instruct LILO to
prompt us for a choice of operating systems, and we need to add a system
entry for Windows. The first part we accomplish by adding a line that
simply says "prompt" at the top of the lilo.conf file.

<P>You'll note a line that says "default=linux". This means that the Linux
boot sequence has been labelled Linux, and is the default if no other
action is taken when LILO starts up. We need to label an alternative for
Windows, and tell LILO where to find Windows on your hard drive. We can do
that with two lines. Assuming you have an IDE hard drive, the two lines
would be:

<pre>
other=/dev/hda1
  label=win
</pre>

<P>This setup means that when LILO initiates the boot process it will give
you a prompt like this "LILO:". It will then wait for you to type in either
"linux" or "win" and will boot either Linux or Windows accordingly.

<P>Once you've made these additions to lilo.conf you should save these
changes and exit Gnotepad. You now have one more vital step to take.

<P>Changing lilo.conf is all very well and good, but you must also alert
LILO that its configuration file has changed. You can do this by opening up
gnome-run, typing "lilo" into the dialog box, and then selecting run.
Unless you have a perverse desire to learn about Linux rescue disks, you
must run lilo to update changes every time you make a change to lilo.conf:

<P><a href="66debian.png"><img src="66debian-mini.jpg"></a>

<P>You now have a dual boot system set up.

<h3>A Brief Glimpse at Debian Upgrading</h3>

<P>Linux offers an abundance of dial-up programs. One of the most robust
and easiest to use is a program called wvdial. If you've followed all our
steps so far, wvdial is not yet installed on your system. You're just a
couple of short steps away from having it installed and configured, and
having an Internet-ready Debian system.

<P>Put your Debian CD in the CDROM drive. Then open gnome-run, and enter
"apt-get install wvdial". Open gnome-run again, and enter "wvdialconf".
You've now installed wvdial, and set up a basic configuration file for it.

<P>You'll need to adjust the base configuration file. In GMC, find the file
/etc/wvdial.conf. Open this file with Gnotepad. You'll see that it has
lines for phone number, user name, and password. You'll need to enter in
your ISP's dial-up number here, the user name your ISP has assigned you,
and the password your ISP has assigned you. Then save the file and exit.

<P>You should now be able to connect to your ISP simply by opening
gnome-run and typing in "wvdial".

<P>Right now your Debian system is set up to recognize the Debian CD as its
source for installation and upgrade. For the time being, as you learn your
way around Debian, that's probably fine. If you discover a new package you
want to install, just pop in the CD and run "apt-get install" followed by
the package name.

<P>At some point, though, you'll want to start upgrading to more recent
versions than the CD provides. This means grabbing updates off the Debian
website. First, you need to get apt to recognize the Debian website as its
source.

<P>In GMC, find the file /etc/apt/sources.list and open it with Gnotepad.
You'll notice a number of lines in this file that begin with "#". This is
the conventional symbol in Linux for a comment statement, in other words a
statement that is human-readable but machine-ignored. If you live in the
U.S., you'll want to remove the "#" from the beginning of this line:

<P><tt> #deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian stable main contrib non-free </tt>

<P>If you live outside the U.S. you'll want to remove the "#" from the
beginning of this line:

<P><tt> #deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib non-free </tt>

<P>In either case you may now add a "#" to the beginning of the line that
begins "deb cdrom".

<P>Now to install packages, you'll need to be connected to the Internet.
Otherwise, the procedure is the same: run "apt-get install [package]".

<P>To upgrade packages, you'll need to do a couple of things. Periodically,
you'll want to run the command "apt-get update". This will update your
system database about what the current versions of packages are. You can
then upgrade a package whenever you're connected to the Internet by simply
running "apt-get upgrade [package]".

<P>Congratulations. You've successfully entered the community of Debian
users.  It's a rich and complex world, but it has much to offer, and you
now have the tools to safely explore it on your own.
