<h2>Security issues</h2>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `potato'.</p>

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ potato/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

<h2>Point releases</h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first point release, 2.2r1, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20001114">November 14, 2000</a>.</li>
  <li>The second point release, 2.2r2, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20001205">December 3, 2000</a>.</li>
  <li>The third point release, 2.2r3, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2001/20010417">April 17, 2001</a>.</li>
  <li>The fourth point release, 2.2r4, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2001/20011105">November 5, 2001</a>.</li>
  <li>The fifth point release, 2.2r5, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020110">January 10, 2002</a>.</li>
  <li>The sixth point release, 2.2r6, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020403">April 3, 2002</a>.</li>
  <li>The seventh point release, 2.2r7, was released on <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020713">July 13, 2002</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>
See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.</p>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

# These links should probably be localized in translated versions,
# if possible.
<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

# someone please verify if this is still true for 2.2r3:
# 
# <h2>Building CD images</h2>
# 
# <p>People wishing to create custom CD images for 2.2r2 will need to use
# the CVS version of `debian-cd' and <strong>not</strong> the version currently
# installed in potato.</p>

<h2>Unofficial Internationalized Installation Support</h2>

<p>An internationalized version of the installation system for i386 is <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/current-i18n/">available</a> for
testing and use.  You need to use the 'idepci' or 'compact' flavors.</p>

<p>Due to some remaining problems with the internationalized
installation system, it is unlikely to be included officially in a
Potato point release.  We can only hope we can get it shaped up for <a
href="../woody/">woody</a>.</p>


<h2>Unofficial ReiserFS Support</h2>

<p>There seem to be at least two unofficial versions of the
installation system for i386 supporting ReiserFS.</p>

<p>One version is from John H. Robinson, IV, and is available with
some instructions at <a
href="http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/">
http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/</a>.</p>

<p>The other is from Marc A. Volovic and is available at <a
href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/">
http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/</a>.</p>


<h2>Unofficial Linux Kernel 2.4 Support</h2>

<p>
Adrian Bunk has provided a set of packages for i386 Potato systems
which provide compatibility for Linux Kernel 2.4.x.  Please read <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">
http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html</a> for instructions,
warnings, and lines to add to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.</p>
