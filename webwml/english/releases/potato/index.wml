<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (a.k.a. Potato) was released on 14 August,
2000.  The latest point release of Debian 2.2 is 
<ifeq "<current_release_name>" "potato"
"<current_release>, released on <current_release_date>."
"2.2r4, released on <:=spokendate('2001-11-5'):>">
# the above will still need to be updated after woody release, but it'll
# be less wrong than saying it's 2.3r0 etc
</p>

<p>For information on the major changes in this release, please refer
to the <a href="#release-notes">Release Notes</a> and to the official
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20000815">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/">Distribution
page</a> for more information on getting Debian.</p>

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (sort keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new in Debian 2.2, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:</p>

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released also
contain detailed instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.</p>

<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">

  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>

<: &permute_as_matrix('release-notes', keys %langsrelnotes); :>

</div>

<p>A <a href="http://master.debian.org/~lapeyre/reports/">detailed
report</a> is available which describes packages which have changed
for the <:= $arches{'i386'} :> architecture during the last two
releases.</p>

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access potato
packages:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian potato main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US potato/non-US main non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
manual pages for more information.</p>

<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:</p>

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Installation Manual'); :>
</ul>

<about_lang_setting>

<div align="center">
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD">

  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<: &permute_as_matrix('install', keys %langsinstall); :>
</table>
</div>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.</p>

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual,
however some parts of it still need work, and much of it is not yet
updated for Debian 2.2.  This particularly applies to details specific
to the <:= $arches{'arm'} :> architecture, and to some of the
non-English translations. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list. You can browse the documentation sources (which are in
DebianDoc SGML) via the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">CVSweb
interface</a> or check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.</p>

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `potato'.</p>

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ potato/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

<h3>Point releases</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.</p>

<p>The first point release, 2.2r1, was released on November 14, 2000.
The second point release, 2.2r2, was released on December 3, 2000.
The third point release, 2.2r3, was released on April 17, 2001.
The fourth point release, 2.2r4, was released on November 5, 2001.
See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.</p>

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).</p>

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:</p>

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by
<kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.</p>

# someone please verify if this is still true for 2.2r3:
# 
# <h3>Building CD images</h3>
# 
# <p>People wishing to create custom CD images for 2.2r2 will need to use
# the CVS version of `debian-cd' and <strong>not</strong> the version currently
# installed in potato.</p>

<h3>Unofficial Internationalized Installation Support</h3>

<p>An internationalized version of the installation system for i386 is <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/current-i18n/">available</a> for
testing and use.  You need to use the 'idepci' or 'compact' flavors.</p>

<p>Due to some remaining problems with the internationalized
installation system, it is unlikely to be included officially in a
Potato point release.  We can only hope we can get it shaped up for <a
href="../woody/">woody</a>.</p>


<h3>Unofficial ReiserFS Support</h3>

<p>There seem to be at least two unofficial versions of the
installation system for i386 supporting ReiserFS.</p>

<p>One version is from John H. Robinson, IV, and is available with
some instructions at <a
href="http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/">
http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/</a>.

The other is from Marc A. Volovic and is available at <a
href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/">
http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/</a>.</p>


<h3>Unofficial Linux Kernel 2.4 Support</h3>

<p>
Adrian Bunk has provided a set of packages for i386 Potato systems
which provide compatibility for Linux Kernel 2.4.x.  Please read <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">
http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html</a> for instructions,
warnings, and lines to add to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.</p>

<h2><a name="reporting-bugs">Reporting Problems</a></h2>

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt> package.  Information you
should submit with your report is discussed in the <a
href="i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-troubleshooting">Installation
Manual</a>.</p>

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the <a
href="#new-inst">Installation Manual</a>, you should also file those
as bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.</p>

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list, <a
href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.</p>

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and file a bug against that
package.</p>

<p>For information on how to file bugs, see the 
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking web page</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="credits">Credits (or Blame)</a></h2>

<h3>Installation System</h3>

<p>Many Debian developers, translators, documenters, testers, and
users have contributed to the development of the installation system
-- too many to mention, in fact.  Adam Di Carlo was the maintainer of
the boot-floppies during the period of the Potato release.  Other
significant contributors can be found in the <code>Maintainers</code>
file of the <code>boot-floppies</code> package.</p>

<p>Thanks to Bill Bennet, The ComputerHelperGuy, for his donation of
Potato <a href="http://www.chguy.net/potato.html">official CDs</a> to
the Debian boot-floppies team.</p>

<h3>The rest of Debian</h3>

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/devel/people">developers</a> and everyone else
who contributed.</p>
