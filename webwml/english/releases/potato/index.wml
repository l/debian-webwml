2000.  The latest point release of Debian 2.2 is 
<current_release>, released on <current_release_date>.

# "2.2r4, released on <:=spokendate('2001-11-5'):>.">
# the above will still need to be updated after woody release, but it'll

</p>

<p>For information on the major changes in this release, please refer
to the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a> and to the official
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20000815">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.</p>
