<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, which is also known as ``potato'', is now
available. For information on the major changes in this release, please
refer to the <a href="#release-notes">Release Notes</a> and to the official
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20000815">press release</a>.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see <a href="../../distrib/">this page</a> for more
information on getting Debian.

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new in Debian 2.2, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released also
contain detailed instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.

<p>For the Intel x86 architecture, a
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~lapeyre/reports/">detailed report</a> is
available which describes packages which have changed since the last two
releases.


<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Installation Manual'); :>
</ul>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual, however
some parts of it still need work. This particularly applies to filling in
details specific to the <:= $arches{'arm'} :> architecture, and to getting
all the translations up to date. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>
mailing list. You can browse the sources
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">via web</a> or
check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.


<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.

<p>Potato has just been released, so there are no Errata yet.

#<p>There is no point release for potato at this point. You can find the
#<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
#on any Debian archive mirror.
#
#<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
#testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However, these
#fixes are available in the
#<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
#dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
#mirror.
#
#If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install the
#proposed updates by adding the following line to
#<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
#
#<pre>
#  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
#</pre>
#
#After that run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get
#upgrade</kbd>.
