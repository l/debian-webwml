#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``potato'' Release Information"

<p>

The code name for the next Debian release will be ``potato''.  It is
likely that this release will be numbered ``2.2'', but that is not yet
certain.

<p>

This release is currently considered ``unstable''.  That means that
things <em>will</em> break if you run it.

<p>

Debian has a strict policy of never announcing release dates;
therefore, the release date for ``potato'' is not yet known.


<h2>Major Changes For ``potato''</h2>

The major changes we know will be part of potato are the following:

<ul>

  <li> Linux kernel 2.2 based (for architectures with Linux kernels at all).

  <li> GNU libc 2.1 based (upwardly binary compatible with GNU libc 2.0)

  <li> The <a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/">egcs</a> version of
<tt>gcc</tt>, also known as <tt>egcc</tt>, will be the default C
compiler.

</ul>

There is also a good chance that the potato release will include the
powerpc and arm architectures.

<p>

There are likely to be many other changes for this release, but these
are not yet known.
