<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (a.k.a. Potato) was released on 14 August,
2000.

<p>For information on the major changes in this release, please refer
to the <a href="#release-notes">Release Notes</a> and to the official
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20000815">press release</a>.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/">Distribution
page</a> for more information on getting Debian.

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (sort keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new in Debian 2.2, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released also
contain detailed instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.

<p>A <a href="http://master.debian.org/~lapeyre/reports/">detailed
report</a> is available which describes packages which have changed
for the <:= $arches{'i386'} :> architecture during the last two
releases.


<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:

<ul>

</ul>

</center>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual,
however some parts of it still need work, and much of it is not yet
updated for Debian 2.2.  This particularly applies to details specific
to the <:= $arches{'arm'} :> architecture, and to some of the
non-English translations. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list. You can browse the documentation sources (which are in
DebianDoc SGML) via the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">CVSweb
interface</a> or check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.



<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.

<p>Potato has no point releases yet.  However, a Debian 2.2r1 is being
planned with improvements in the installation system and other
critical updates.

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror.

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> should be
consulted for information about any security issues identified.

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:

<pre>
  # security updates
  deb http://security.debian.org/ potato/updates main contrib non-free
  # proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>

After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get
upgrade</kbd>.
