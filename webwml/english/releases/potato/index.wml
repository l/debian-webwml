<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.</p>

manual pages for more information.</p>

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there are some problems that exist in the
potato release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can
always <a href="reportingbugs">report other issues</a> to us.</p>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code> file.
To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, MD5 checksums of all
<code>Packages</code> files are copied into the
<code>Release</code> file.  Digital signatures for this file are
stored in the file <code>Release.gpg</code>, using this key: <a
href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2002.asc">\
ftpmaster</a>.</p>

<p>To verify the <code>Release</code> file, you'll have to fetch both
files and execute <code>gpg --verify Release.gpg Release</code> after
importing the keys it is signed with.</p>

<p>Last but not least, we have a list of <a href="credits">people who take
credit</a> for making this release happen.</p>
