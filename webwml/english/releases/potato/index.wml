<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>The code name for the next Debian release will be ``potato'', which is
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>This release is currently frozen.  That means that things are still in
testing prior to it being released as the next stable distribution.

<p>Debian has a strict policy of never announcing release dates;
therefore, the release date for ``potato'' is not yet known.

<p>The following architectures will be supported in potato:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 will be available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see <a href="../../distrib/">this page</a> for more
information on getting Debian.

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new for Debian 2.2, see the Release Notes for your
architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<p>The Release Notes for architectures that were previously released also
contain detailed instructions for users who are upgrading from prior
releases.

<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<: &permute_as_matrix('release-notes', @langsrelnotes); :>
</table>
</center>

<p>For the Intel x86 architecture, a
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~lapeyre/reports/">detailed report</a> is
available which describes packages which have changed since the last two
releases.


<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Installation Manual'); :>
</ul>

<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<: &permute_as_matrix('install', @langsinstall); :>
</table>
</center>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual, however
some parts of it still need work. This particularly applies to filling in
details specific to the <:= $arches{'arm'} :> architecture, and to getting
all the translations up to date. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>
mailing list. You can browse the sources
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">via web</a> or
check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.


<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.

<p>Potato isn't released yet, so there can't be any updates to it. :-)

#<p>There is no point release for potato at this point. You can find the
#<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
#on any Debian archive mirror.
#
#<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
#testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However, these
#fixes are available in the
#<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
#dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
#mirror.
#
#If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install the
#proposed updates by adding the following line to
#<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
#
#<pre>
#  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
#</pre>
#
#After that run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get
#upgrade</kbd>.
