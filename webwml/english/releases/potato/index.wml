<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (a.k.a. Potato) was released on
<:=spokendate ("2000-08-14"):>.  The latest point release of Debian 2.2 is
<current_release_potato>, released on <current_release_date_potato>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 has been obsoleted by
<a href="../woody/">Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 ("woody")</a>.
Security updates are discontinued as of June 30th, 2003.</strong>
Please see
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/debian-devel-announce-200302/msg00010.html">\
the security team survey results</a> for more information.</p>   

<p>For information on the major changes in this release, please refer
to the <a href="releasenotes">Release Notes</a> and to the official
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2000/20000815">press release</a>.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated to the memory of Joel "Espy" Klecker, a
Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian Project, was bedridden
and fighting a disease known as Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy during most of
his involvement with Debian. Only now is the Debian Project realizing the
extent of his dedication, and the friendship he bestowed upon us. So as a
show of appreciation, and in memory of his inspirational life, this release
of Debian GNU/Linux is dedicated to him.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/">Distribution
page</a> for more information on getting Debian.</p>

<p>The following architectures are supported in this release:</p>

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (sort keys %arches) {
      print "<li><a href=\"$(HOME)/ports/$arch/\">$arches{$arch}</a>\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<p>Before installing Debian, please read the <A HREF="installmanual">\
Installation Manual</A>. The Installation Manual for your target
architecture contains instructions and links for all the files you need
to install. You might also be interested in the <a href="installguide/">\
installation guide for Debian 2.2</a>, which is an on line tutorial.</p>

<p>If you are using APT, you can use the following lines in your
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> file to be able to access potato
packages:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org potato main contrib non-free
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US potato/non-US main non-free
</pre>

<p>Read the <code>apt-get</code>(8) and the <code>sources.list</code>(5)
<<<<<<< index.wml
manual pages for more information.

<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Installation Manual'); :>
</ul>

<about_lang_setting>

<p>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<: &permute_as_matrix('install', keys %langsinstall); :>
</table>
</center>

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual,
however some parts of it still need work, and much of it is not yet
updated for Debian 2.2.  This particularly applies to details specific
to the <:= $arches{'arm'} :> architecture, and to some of the
non-English translations. If you wish to contribute changes, contact
the <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list. You can browse the documentation sources (which are in
DebianDoc SGML) via the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">CVSweb
interface</a> or check them out
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/~checkout~/boot-floppies/README-CVS?tag=HEAD&content-type=text/plain">
using CVS</a>.

<h3>Security issues</h3>

<p>Debian security team issues updates to packages in the stable release
in which they've identified problems related to security. Please consult the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/">security pages</a> for information about
any security issues identified in `potato'.

<p>If you use APT, add the following line to <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>
to be able to access the latest security updates:

<pre>
  deb http://security.debian.org/ potato/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>After that, run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get upgrade</kbd>.

<h3>Point releases</h3>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of several critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.

<<<<<<< index.wml
<<<<<<< index.wml
<<<<<<< index.wml
<p>Potato has just been released, so there are no Errata yet.
=======
<p>Potato has no point releases yet.  However, a Debian 2.2r1 is being
planned with improvements in the installation system and other
critical updates.
=======
<p>Potato is currently at its first point release, 2.2r1. See the
<a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
for details on changes.
>>>>>>> 1.25
=======
<p>The first point release, 2.2r1, was released on November 14, 2000.
The second point release, 2.2r2, was released on December 3, 2000.
The third point release, 2.2r3, was released on April 17, 2001.
See the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog</a> (and
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato/non-US/ChangeLog">
ChangeLog for non-US</a>) for details on changes.
>>>>>>> 1.31

<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an
extended testing period before they are accepted into the archive.
However, these fixes are available in the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
mirror (and on the same location at our
<a href="ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
non-US server</a> and its mirrors).

<p>If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install
the proposed updates by adding the following line to
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:

<pre>
  \# proposed additions for a 2.2 point release
  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US dists/proposed-updates/
</pre>
=======
manual pages for more information.</p>
>>>>>>> 1.59

<p>Contrary to our wishes, there are some problems that exist in the
potato release, even though it is declared <em>stable</em>. We've made
<a href="errata">a list of the major known problems</a>, and you can
always <a href="reportingbugs">report other issues</a> to us.</p>

<p>Data integrity is granted by a digitally signed <code>Release</code> file.
To ensure that all files in the release belong to it, MD5 checksums of all
<code>Packages</code> files are copied into the
<code>Release</code> file.  Digital signatures for this file are
stored in the file <code>Release.gpg</code>, using this key: <a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2002.asc">\
ftpmaster</a>.</p>

<p>To verify the <code>Release</code> file, you'll have to fetch both
files and execute <code>gpg --verify Release.gpg Release</code> after
importing the keys it is signed with.</p>

<<<<<<< index.wml
# someone please verify if this is still true for 2.2r3:
# 
# <h3>Building CD images</h3>
# 
# <p>People wishing to create custom CD images for 2.2r2 will need to use
# the CVS version of `debian-cd' and <strong>not</strong> the version currently
# installed in potato.

<h3>Unofficial Internationalized Installation Support</h3>

<p>An internationalized version of the installation system for i386 is <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/current-i18n/">available</a> for
testing and use.  You need to use the 'idepci' or 'compact' flavors.

<<<<<<< index.wml
<p>This system is projected to be incorporated in Debian Potato as of
2.2r3.  It will be supported for i386 flavors that support
framebuffer, and for other architecture depending on whether the
porters are able to incorporate it.

<<<<<<< index.wml
<p>CDs for Alpha and SPARC for 2.2 initially had some problems not
being bootable.  Be sure if you buy CDs that you request those
labelled ``2.2rev0a'' or better.
>>>>>>> 1.18

<<<<<<< index.wml
#<p>There is no point release for potato at this point. You can find the
#<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
#on any Debian archive mirror.
#
#<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
#testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However, these
#fixes are available in the
#<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
#dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
#mirror.
#
#If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install the
#proposed updates by adding the following line to
#<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
#
#<pre>
#  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
#</pre>
#
#After that run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get
#upgrade</kbd>.
=======
=======
>>>>>>> 1.31
=======
<p>Due to some remaining problems with the internationalized
installation system, it is unlikely to be included officially in a
Potato point release.  We can only hope we can get it shaped up for <a
href="../woody/">woody</a>.


<<<<<<< index.wml
>>>>>>> 1.32
=======
<h3>Unofficial ReiserFS Support</h3>

<p>There seem to be at least two unofficial versions of the
installation system for i386 supporting ReiserFS.

<p>One version is from John H. Robinson, IV, and is available with
some instructions at <a
href="http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/">
http://chao.ucsd.edu/debian/boot-floppies/</a>.

The other is from Marc A. Volovic and is available at <a
href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/">
http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/linux/rfs/</a>.


<h3>Unofficial Linux Kernel 2.4 Support</h3>

<<<<<<< index.wml
>>>>>>> 1.36
=======
<p>
Adrian Bunk has provided a set of packages for i386 Potato systems
which provide compatibility for Linux Kernel 2.4.x.  Please read <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">
http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html</a> for instructions,
warnings, and lines to add to <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>.

<h2><a name="reporting-bugs">Reporting Problems</a></h2>

<p>If you have a problem with the installation system, please report
bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt> package.  Information you
should submit with your report is discussed in the <a
href="i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-troubleshooting">Installation
Manual</a>.

<p>If you have suggestions or corrections for the <a
href="#new-inst">Installation Manual</a>, you should also file those
as bugs against the <tt>boot-floppies</tt>, which is the package in
which that documentation is maintained.

<p>If you have issues with the installation system which aren't
appropriate for a bug (e.g., you're not sure if it's truly a bug or
not, the offending piece of the system is unclear, etc.) you should
probably send an email to the mailing list, <a
href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">
&lt;debian-boot@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.

<p>If you have problems with the system after installation, you should
try to track down the offending package and file a bug against that
package.

<p>For information on how to file bugs, see the 
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking web page</a>.

<h2><a name="credits">Credits (or Blame)</a></h2>

<h3>Installation System</h3>

<p>Many Debian developers, translators, documenters, testers, and
users have contributed to the development of the installation system
-- too many to mention, in fact.  Adam Di Carlo was the maintainer of
the boot-floppies during the period of the Potato release.  Other
significant contributors can be found in the <code>Maintainers</code>
file of the <code>boot-floppies</code> package.

<p>Thanks to Bill Bennet, The ComputerHelperGuy, for his donation of
Potato <a href="http://www.chguy.net/potato.html">official CDs</a> to
the Debian boot-floppies team.
