<h2><a name="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>The code name for the next Debian release will be ``potato'', which is
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>This release is currently frozen.  That means that things are still in
testing prior to it being released as the next stable distribution.

<p>Debian has a strict policy of never announcing release dates;
therefore, the release date for ``potato'' is not yet known.

<p>The following architectures will be supported in potato:

<ul>
<: foreach $arch (keys %arches) {
      print "<li> " . $arches{$arch} . "\n";
   } :>
</ul>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 will be available from the Internet or from CD
vendors, please see <a href="../../distrib/">this page</a> for more
information on getting Debian.

<:

$about_lang_setting = "If you have set your browser's localization
properly, you can use the above link to get the right HTML version
automatically -- see <A href=\"$base_url/intro/cn\"><setlang></A>.
Otherwise, pick the exact architecture, language, and format you want
from the table below.\n";

<h2><a name="release-notes">Release Notes</a></h2>

<p>To find out what's new for Debian 2.2, see the Release Notes for your
architecture.  The Release Notes also contain detailed instructions for
users who are upgrading from prior releases.

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('release-notes/', 'Release Notes'); :>
</ul>

<: print $about_lang_setting; :>

<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<:= &permute_as_matrix('release-notes/index', 'english', 'croatian', 'czech',
		      'german', 'japanese', 'portuguese', 'russian');
:>
</table>
</center>

#<p>For the i386 architecture, a <a href="i386/reports">detailed report</a>
#is available which describes packages which have changed since the last two
#releases.


<h2><a name="new-inst">New Installations</a></h2>

<p>Installation instructions, along with downloadable files, are broken
out by architecture:

<ul>
<:= &permute_as_list('install', 'Install Manual'); :>
</ul>

<: print $about_lang_setting; :>

<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 bgcolor="#DDDDDD"> 
<tr bgcolor="#44CCCC">
  <th align="left"><strong>Architecture</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Format</strong></th>
  <th align="left"><strong>Languages</strong></th>
</tr>
<:= &permute_as_matrix('install', 'english', 'croatian',  'czech', 
		      'finnish', 'french', 'german', 
		      'japanese', 'portuguese', 'russian', 'spanish');
:>
</table>
</center>

<p>A lot of effort has been put into the Debian Installation Manual in order
to support non-i386 distributions.  However, some architectures (notably
<:= $arches{'arm'} :>) still need work -- see the document itself for
information on how you can contribute.

<p>These web pages will be updated with new versions of the Installation
Manual for potato as they become available.  If you wish to contribute
changes, see the section and the manual; you can also retrieve the <a
href="source/">SGML source</a> -- patches are the best form of comments. 
Contributors or readers wonder exactly what is new should see the <a
href="source/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>.


<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of critical problems or security updates, the
released distribution is updated.  Generally, these are indicated as point
releases.

<p>Potato isn't released yet, so there can't be any updates to it. :-)

#<p>There is no point release for potato at this point. You can find the
#<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a>
#on any Debian archive mirror.
#
#<p>Fixes to the released stable distribution often go through an extended
#testing period before they are accepted into the archive.  However, these
#fixes are available in the
#<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato-proposed-updates/">
#dists/potato-proposed-updates</a> directory of any Debian archive
#mirror.
#
#If you use <tt>apt</tt> to update your packages, you can install the
#proposed updates by adding the following line to
#<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:
#
#<pre>
#  deb http://http.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/
#</pre>
#
#After that run <kbd>apt-get update</kbd> followed by <kbd>apt-get
#upgrade</kbd>.
