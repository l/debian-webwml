<H1>Errata for Debian 2.0 on x86 machines</H1>

<P>There are no reported errata in the installation or upgrade process
at this time.

<P>The following are problems with software upgrades that you should be careful of:                   
<ul>                                                                                                  
   <li>(Jul 24) There is a Y2K problem in the version of CVS in 2.0. A fixed version
       will be released to slink as soon as the author releases a new version.
   <li>(Jul 24) A security bug in svgalib was discovered too late to allow the fix
       into 2.0. If you use svgalib you should upgrade to the version in unstable.
       It should be available in a few days.
   <li>(Jul 24) There is a security hole in cfingerd, though Debian is not vulnerable as
       shipped. You need to turn on certain options in the config file to allow
       the vulnerability. To be safe, upgrade to the version in slink.
</ul>
