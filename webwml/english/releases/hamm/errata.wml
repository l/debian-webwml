<H1>Errata for Debian 2.0 on x86 machines</H1>

<P>There are no reported errata in the installation or upgrade process
at this time.

<P>The following are problems with software upgrades that you should be careful of:                   
<ul>                                                                                                  
   <li>(Jul 24) There is a Y2K problem in the version of CVS in 2.0. A fixed version
       will be released to slink as soon as the author releases a new version.
   <li>(Jul 24) A security bug in svgalib was discovered to late to allow the fix
       into 2.0. If you use svgalib you should upgrade to the version in unstable.
</ul>
