<H1>Updates to Debian 2.0</H1>

<P>Several packages in Debian 2.0 have been updated since its release
on July 24th to reflect security enhancements and other changes too
important to leave until the next major release.  It is strongly
suggested that those using packages that have updates in
the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable-updates/">stable-updates</a>
distribution upgrade to the versions
there.  Those using the new package tool <EM>apt</EM> may wish to add
the following line to their <TT>/etc/apt/sources.list</TT> file to
faciliatate easy upgrades to the newer packages, changing the URI as
appropriate:
<blockquote>
<TT>deb http://ftp1.us.debian.org/debian dists/stable-updates/</TT>
</blockquote>
