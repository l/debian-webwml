</H2>

<P>The minimum list of packages to install to be able to run unstable-branch
packages is below.  Install these packages one at a time in exactly the
order listed.  When versions are mentioned, that is a minimum suggested
version, any later version should also be acceptable.

<H2><A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Upgrading bash</A>
</H2>

<P>
<P>While you can install many libc6 package with just ldso and libc6, you will
probably want to upgrade a few other packages as well.  Since bash-2.01
fixes problems experienced with Netscape and helper applications, it is one
of the more likely packages to need updated.  However, it is also one of the
few packages that is capable of rendering your system useless if upgraded
incorrectly.  Install the packages below one at a time in exactly the order
listed.
<P><EM>IMPORTANT: If you use dselect to do the initial upgrade of these
packages, there is a very good possibility of breaking bash and therefore
making your system unusable.</EM>

<UL>
<LI>ncurses3.0_1.9.9e-2</LI>
<LI>ncurses3.4_1.9.9g-5</LI>

<LI>bash_2.01-5</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Other Suggested Packages</A>
</H2>

<P>These packages are not absolutely essential for the functioning of the
packages in unstable, but are still very useful.  The new dpkg-dev may be
necessary for unpacking source archives from unstable, and the new dpkg-ftp
is needed if you wish to use the ftp method of dselect to upgrade your
system to the unstable distribution.

<LI>dpkg-ftp_1.4.9</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Other Possible Conflicts</A>
</H2>

<P>Since perl is used in many package installation scripts, problems with with
library upgrades may temporarily break perl, which may break other package
installations.  To be safe, install the new libgdbm1 and then the new
libgdbmg1 packages by hand before upgrading perl.
