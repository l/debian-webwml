<H2><A NAME="s1">1. Introduction</A></H2>

<P>The Debian project is currently in the process of putting together the next
release of the Debian system.  This version will utilize the new libc6, a
replacement for the prior libc5 which includes many enhancements and brings
the Linux C library back into sync with the GNU project.  We are doing this
in a way to allow you to continue to utilize your older software by
providing development and operating environments for both C libraries. 
However, all packages in the new release will be linked with the new C
library.  This has made it slightly more difficult to install packages from
the unstable branch of our development tree into a working system.  There is
a slight possibility of making your system unbootable in the process, this
guide is intended to help you avoid such problems.
