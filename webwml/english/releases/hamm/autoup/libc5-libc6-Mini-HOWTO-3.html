<P>If you wish to do libc6 development, you should first purge all the '-dev'
packages on your system, the new development system will use packages with
the suffix '-dev' for libc6 development and '-altdev' for libc5 development. 
You will wish to install the latest libc5 package, and altgcc if you wish
continue to do libc5 development as well.  Some libraries haven't been
recompiled for the new libc6 yet, check that all your vital libraries are
available before upgrading.  Linking libc5-based libraries with libc6-based
programs will have unpredictable results.
