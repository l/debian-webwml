#use wml::debian::template title="Upgrading to Debian 2.0 on x86 machines"

<P>To avoid problems in upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a special upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describes that procedure.

<P>There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
  <ol>
  <li>autoup.sh<br>
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is available at the following sites:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/autoup/">http://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/autoup/</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/hamm/main/upgrade-i386/">http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/hamm/main/upgrade-i386/</a></li>
        </ul>
  <li>apt-get<br>
       This is the command line part of Debian's future
     package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
     download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
     able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use a CD,
     an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
     speed, variety, and latest versions.  
     Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.
     The 'Bo' version is at:
     <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/hamm/main/upgrade-i386/">http://archive.debian.org/debian/dists/hamm/main/upgrade-i386/</a>.
     The Bo version of apt-get is well tested. apt-get is officially part of the packaging system
     starting with slink.
  <li>By hand<br>
       A HOWTO can be found at:
     <a href="$HOME/releases/hamm/autoup/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">
     $HOME/releases/hamm/autoup/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>
     but as the autoup.sh simply automates this process this is the
     least convenient option.
  </ol>

<H3>Questions and Answers</H3>
<pre>
Q: Why not just use dselect's ftp method like normal?
A: It will not order the package installation correctly so
   can't guarantee a smooth upgrade. Work is being done on APT,
   a new front-end to dpkg. With apt, all future upgrades will
   be easier than ever and will not suffer from this type of
   inconvenience.

Q: Ok, I did the upgrade, am I safe to do things again?
A: Yes, you can use dselect again.
