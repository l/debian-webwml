<H1>Upgrading to Debian 2.0 on x86 machines</H1>

<P>To avoid problems in upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a special upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describes that procedure.

<P>There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
  <ol>
  <li>autoup.sh<br>
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is available at the following sites:
        <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/">http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a>
        </ul>
  <li>apt-get<br>
       This is the command line part of Debian's future
     package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
     download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
     able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use a CD,
     an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
     speed, variety, and latest versions.  
     Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.
     The 'Bo' version is at:
     <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>.
     Or you can simply grab the
     <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/apt-get.bo.current.deb">latest version</a>.
     The Bo version of apt-get is well tested. apt-get is officially part of the packaging system
     starting with slink, the current unstable release. It is still under development so
     the version in slink should not be relied on for mission critical systems.
  <li>By hand<br>
       A HOWTO can be found at:
     <a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">
     http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>
     but as the autoup.sh simply automates this process this is the
     least convenient option.
  </ol>

<H3>Questions and Answers</H3>
<pre>
Q: Why not just use dselect's ftp method like normal?
A: It will not order the package installation correctly so
   can't guarantee a smooth upgrade. Work is being done on APT,
   a new front-end to dpkg. With apt, all future upgrades will
   be easier than ever and will not suffer from this type of
   inconvenience.

Q: Ok, I did the upgrade, am I safe to do things again?
A: Yes, you can use dselect again.
