<H2><A name="mail_lists" href="MailingLists/">Mailing lists</A></H2>

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore e-mail is a preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several mailing lists.

<P>There are several publicly available mailing lists. For more information,
see <a href="MailingLists/">Debian mailing lists</a> page.

<P>There are many other Linux mailing lists, which are not Debian-specific.
Please refer to
<A HREF="http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/">this index</A>.

<HR>
<H2><A name="maintainers">Reaching Package Maintainers</A></H2>

<P>There are two ways of reaching package maintainers. If you need to
contact the maintainer because of a bug, simply file a bug report (see the
Bug Tracking System section below). The maintainer will get a copy of the
bug report.

<P>If you simply want to communicate with the maintainer, then you can use
the special mail aliases set up for each package. Any mail sent to
&lt;<EM>package name</EM>&gt;@packages.debian.org will be forwarded to the
maintainer responsible for that package.

<HR>
<H2><A name="bts" href="Bugs/">The Bug Tracking System</A></H2>

<P>The Debian GNU/Linux distribution has a bug tracking system which
details bugs reported by users and developers.  Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt
with.

<P>To report a bug, you can use one of the bug pages listed below, or you
can use the Debian package 'bug' to automatically file a bug report.

<P>Information on submitting bugs, viewing the currently active bugs, and
the bug tracking system in general can be found at the
<A HREF="Bugs/">bug tracking system web pages</A>.

<HR>
<H2><A name="consultants" href="consultants/">Consultants</A></H2>

<P>Debian is free software and offers free help through mailing lists. Some
people either don't have the time or have specialized needs and are willing
to hire someone to maintain or add additional functionality to their Debian
system.  See the <A href="consultants/">consultants page</A> for a list
of people/companies.

<HR>
<H2><A name="irc">On-line Real Time Help Using IRC</A></H2>

<P><a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</a> is a way
to chat with people from all over the world in real time. An IRC channel
dedicated to Debian can be found on the
<a href="http://www.openprojects.net/">Open Projects IRC
network</a>.

<p>To connect, you need an IRC client. Some of the most popular clients are
ircII, BitchX, tkirc, X-Chat and Zircon, all of which have been packaged for
Debian. Once you have the client installed, you need to tell it to connect
to our server, which is called <code>irc.debian.org</code>. In most clients,
you can do that by typing:

<pre>
/server irc.debian.org
</pre>

<p>Once you are connected, join channel <code>#debian</code> by typing

<pre>
/join #debian
</pre>

<p>Note: X-Chat, Zircon and other GUI-based clients are different. They use
an intuitive graphical interface for joining servers/channels.

<p>At this point you will find yourself among the friendly crowd of
<code>#debian</code> inhabitants. You're welcome to ask questions about
Debian there. For a list of channel rules, see the
<a href="http://www.linpeople.org/rules.html">LinPeople rules</a> page.

<p>If you can't find an answer to your problem in #Debian, try channels
like #LinPeople, #LinuxHelp, or #help.
