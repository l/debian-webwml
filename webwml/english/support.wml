<h2><a name="doc" href="doc/">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>Before searching for support from someone else, it's usually good to try
to find an answer to your problem yourself. That way you will usually get
the answers you need, and even if you don't, the experience of reading the
documentation will likely be useful for you in the future.</p>

<p>There is a fair amount of documentation available in Debian -- please
refer to the <a href="doc/">Debian documentation</a> web page.</p>

<H2><A name="mail_lists" href="MailingLists/">Mailing lists</A></H2>

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore e-mail is a preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several mailing lists.

<P>There are several publicly available mailing lists. For more information,
see <a href="MailingLists/">Debian mailing lists</a> page.

<P>There are many other Linux mailing lists, which are not Debian-specific.
Please refer to
<A HREF="http://oslab.snu.ac.kr/~djshin/linux/mail-list/">this index</A>.

<hr>

<h2><a name="usenet">Usenet newsgroups</a></h2>

<p>A lot of our <a href="#mail_lists">mailing lists</a> can be browsed as
newsgroups, in the <kbd>linux.debian.*</kbd> hierarchy. This can also be
done using a web interface such as
<a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google Groups</a> or
<a href="http://gmane.org/">Gmane</a>.

<p>There are also a couple of proper newsgroups available that are related
to GNU/Linux. Despite the fact they're not specific to Debian, they can
still provide Debian users with a lot of information.</p>

<h2><a name="web">Web sites</a></H2>

<p><a href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">debianHELP</a> is a web portal
on which you can submit questions about Debian and have them answered by
other users.</p>

<H2><A name="maintainers">Reaching Package Maintainers</A></H2>

<P>There are two ways of reaching package maintainers. If you need to
contact the maintainer because of a bug, simply file a bug report (see the
Bug Tracking System section below). The maintainer will get a copy of the
bug report.

<P>If you simply want to communicate with the maintainer, then you can use
the special mail aliases set up for each package. Any mail sent to
&lt;<EM>package name</EM>&gt;@packages.debian.org will be forwarded to the
maintainer responsible for that package.

<HR>
<H2><A name="bts" href="Bugs/">The Bug Tracking System</A></H2>

<P>The Debian GNU/Linux distribution has a bug tracking system which
details bugs reported by users and developers.  Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt
with.

<P>To report a bug, you can use one of the bug pages listed below, or you
can use the Debian package 'bug' to automatically file a bug report.

<P>Information on submitting bugs, viewing the currently active bugs, and
the bug tracking system in general can be found at the
<A HREF="Bugs/">bug tracking system web pages</A>.

<HR>
<H2><A name="consultants" href="consultants/">Consultants</A></H2>

<P>Debian is free software and offers free help through mailing lists. Some
people either don't have the time or have specialized needs and are willing
to hire someone to maintain or add additional functionality to their Debian
system.  See the <A href="consultants/">consultants page</A> for a list
of people/companies.

<HR>
<H2><A name="irc">On-line Real Time Help Using IRC</A></H2>

<P><a href="http://www.irchelp.org/">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</a> is a way
to chat with people from all over the world in real time.
IRC channels dedicated to Debian can be found on the
<a href="http://www.freenode.info/">freenode IRC network</a>.</p>

<p>To connect, you need an IRC client. Some of the most popular clients are
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/xchat.html">XChat</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/bitchx.html">BitchX</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/non-us/ircii.html">ircII</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/irssi-text.html">irssi</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/epic4.html">epic4</a> and
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/ksirc.html">KSirc</a>,
all of which have been packaged for
Debian. Once you have the client installed, you need to tell it to connect
to the server. In most clients, you can do that by typing:</p>

<pre>
/server irc.debian.org
</pre>

<p>Once you are connected, join channel <code>#debian</code> by typing

<pre>
/join #debian
</pre>

<p>Note: clients like XChat often have a different, graphical user interface
for joining servers/channels.</p>

<p>At this point you will find yourself among the friendly crowd of
<code>#debian</code> inhabitants. You're welcome to ask questions about
Debian there. For a list of channel rules, see the
<a href="http://www.linpeople.org/rules.html">LinPeople rules</a> page.

<p>If you can't find an answer to your problem in #Debian, try channels
like #LinPeople, #LinuxHelp, or #help.

<p>Furthermore, please remember that there is a very large number of other
networks with Debian IRC support, like, for instance, the newly estabilished
<a href="http://www.oftc.net/">OFTC</a> IRC network.
