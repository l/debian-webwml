#use wml::debian::template title="Submit Mirror Information"

If you would like to submit information about a mirror of Debian
(ftp archive, web, Incoming), you can do so using this form. There is
an example at the bottom of the page in case you are unsure how
to proceed. If you need to submit changes, simply make
a new (complete) submission and add a comment stating it is an update.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> not all information provided will be
displayed in the mirror list (such as the mirror maintainer address).

<H3>Examples</H3>
<pre>
Site: ftp.debian.org
Aliases: saens.debian.org
Archive-http: /debian/
     This is for http://ftp.debian.org/debian/ . It should point at the root of the
     Debian archive.
Archive-ftp: /debian/
     This is for ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/
Archive-rsync: debian/
     This is the directory used for rsync access. BTW, this is NOT anonymous accessible.
     Most sites will not be accessible via rsync.
Name of site maintainer: debian-admin@debian.org
     The maintainer address will not be shown on the public lists
Country: US
Comment: Any notes you feel would help others
</pre>

And another example
<pre>
Site: www.uk.debian.org
Aliases: open.hands.com
WWW-http: /
     This means the Debian web pages can be accessed as http://www.uk.debian.org/
WWW-rsync: debian-web/
     This is the directory used for rsync access to the web pages. BTW, this is NOT anonymous accessible.
Maintainer: Philip Hands &lt;abc@address.goes.here&gt;
Country: UK
</pre>
<pre>
Site: ftp.uk.debian.org
Aliases: open.hands.com
Archive-http: /debian/
Archive-ftp: /debian/
Archive-rsync: debian/
Maintainer: Philip Hands &lt;abc@address.goes.here&gt;
Country: UK
</pre>

<p>Sites should be listed under the name they shoud be listed under, with other names listed
under Aliases (in other words, probably backwards from the DNS entries). This means that
web and archive mirrors should get seperate listings as in the second example above.

<p>If you maintain copies of old versions of Debian you can submit the access point by
submitting a new entry. In the new submission list only the access points under the
Archive-* listings and add a comment stating what the new entry is for. For example:
<pre>
Site: ftp.debian.org
Archive-http: /debian-archive/
Archive-ftp: /debian-archive/
Archive-rsync: debian-archive/
Country: US
Comment: The locations listed mirror old versions of Debian
</pre>
