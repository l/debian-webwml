#use wml::debian::template title="Types of Mirrors"

<p>There are two types of Debian mirrors, <em>official</em> and
<em>unofficial</em>.

<p>Anyone can mirror Debian. You don't even need our permission.
Some sites with good bandwidth, though, like to help Debian by becoming an
Official mirror.
Official mirrors get an address of the form ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org
or www.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org (both if you mirror the archive and web
pages). These are the best advertised and most used sites; the face of
Debian for most people. In exchange, your organization may put a logo
on the main Debian page (on the copy on your mirror) with a link to your
organizations web site.

<p>If you are not interested in becoming an official mirror, set up your
<a href="ftpmirror">FTP mirror</a> or <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a>
and <a href="submit">register the mirror</a>.

<p>The following are the requirements for an official mirror site:
<UL>
<LI>The site must be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine must
	not be heavily loaded.
<LI>It must have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective country).
	Bandwidth equivalent to a T1 connection or better is preferred.
<LI>For FTP mirrors: the Debian FTP hierarchy must be available under /debian
	(this is done for consistency between sites &mdash; you may simply
	place a symlink if you want to keep the mirror somewhere else).
	<br>
	The whole FTP archive should be mirrored. If there are space
	constraints, you can exclude the unreleased ports (dists/sid) and
	the new distribution under development (dists/unstable), but please
	keep the whole stable release (dists/stable).
<LI>For FTP mirrors: the FTP archive should be made available using HTTP
	(ftp://ftp.site/debian/ should also be accessible as
	http://ftp.site/debian/). We are asking this from all official FTP
	sites because with HTTP/1.1, web transfers have the potential of
	being more efficient than with FTP, so we are trying to make a move
	in that direction.
<LI>For WWW mirrors: a virtual server, with its own IP address.
#	If possible the mailing list and bug archives should be mirrored too.
#	TODO: mirroring for this hasn't been set up yet on our hosts -- Joy
<LI>For WWW mirrors: content negotiation must be enabled in the HTTP server.
	Apache supports this quite well. This is to allow us to serve the web
	pages in multiple languages transparently (for those who have set up
	their browser properly).
	<br>
	See the section on <a href="webmirror#cn">content negotiation</a>.
<LI>Disk space commitments (with room for expansion):
	<ul>
	  <li>at least 16 GB for FTP mirror (or much less, depending on what
	      you exclude)
	  <li>at least 400 MB for WWW mirror
	</ul>
<LI>The mirror must be updated at least once a day. If possible, set up
	push-mirroring from Debian sites.
</UL>

<P>Please note that these are just guidelines. If you are unsure of something,
send a note to <A href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">mirrors@debian.org</A>
with your questions.

<P>Note for WWW mirrors: all of our CGI scripts are run centrally on
cgi.debian.org, so you don't need to worry about them.

<P>Official mirrors should be registered just like any other mirror using
the <a href="submit">mirror submission form</a>. Additionally, the
address of the machine along with the name and e-mail of the person
who will be maintaining the mirror should be mailed to
<A href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">mirrors@debian.org</A> along with a request
to become an official site so that the DNS will be set up.
When everything is working, your site will be added to the web pages.

<P>Multiple official sites can be set up in each country. In large countries, like
the US, and countries with more than one major backbone that aren't well connected,
like Australia, it is even a good idea. The first site will be given the aliases
ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org and ftp1.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org (similarly for WWW). Future
sites will simply be given an alias of the second type with the number incremented
appropriately.
