#use wml::debian::template title="Types of Mirrors"

<h3>There are two types of Debian mirrors, <i>Official</i> and <i>Unofficial</i></h3>

<p>Anyone can mirror Debian. You don't even need our permission.
Some sites with good bandwidth, though, like to help Debian by becoming an
Official mirror.
Official mirrors get an address of the form ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org
or www.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org (both if you mirror the archive and web
pages). These are the best advertised and most used sites; the face of
Debian for most people. In exchange, your organization may put a logo
on the main Debian page (on the copy on your mirror) with a link to your
organizations web site.

<p>If you are not interested in becoming an official mirror, set up your
<a href="ftpmirror">FTP mirror</a> or <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a>
and <a href="submit">register the mirror</a>.

<p>The following are the requirements for an official mirror site:
<UL>
<LI>The site must be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine must
	not be heavily loaded.
<LI>It must have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective country).
	Bandwidth equivalent to a T1 connection or better is preferred.
<LI>For ftp: the debian ftp hierarchy must be available under /debian
	This is done for consistency between sites. All the officially released
	ports of Debian should be mirrored (both stable and unstable) unless there
	are space constraints.
	The released ports can be found by looking in dists/stable/main
	in the archive.
	If space permits, you should also mirror the archive for the ports of Debian
	that are under development.
<LI>For ftp: we are asking that all official ftp sites also make the ftp archive
	available using http (ftp://ftp.site/debian should be accessible as
	http://ftp.site/debian). With http/1.1, web transfers have the potential of being
	more efficient than with ftp so we are trying to make a move in that direction.
<LI>For www: a real virtual server with its own IP address. If possible
	the mailing list and bug archives should be mirrored too. If you are unable to
	mirror these, you must redirect requests for them to another site.
<LI>For www: cgi scripts are run centrally on cgi.debian.org so you don't
	need to worry about them.
<LI>For www: content negotiation must be enabled. This is to allow us to serve
	the web pages in multiple languages transparently (for those who have set up
	their browser properly). Apache supports this quite well. See the section
   on <a href="webmirror#cn">content negotiation</a>.
<LI>Disk space commitments (with room for expansion):
	<ul>
	<li>1.5+GB for www (includes list and bug archives)
	<li>6+GB for ftp
	</ul>
<LI>The mirror must be updated at least once a day. If possible, mirror the
	bug archives more frequently.
</UL>
Please note that these are just guidelines. If you are unsure of something,
send a note to <A href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">mirrors@debian.org</A>
with your questions.

<P>Official mirrors should be registered just like any other mirror using
the <a href="submit">mirror submission form</a>. Additionally, the
address of the machine along with the name and e-mail of the person
who will be maintaining the mirror should be mailed to
<A href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">mirrors@debian.org</A> along with a request
to become an official site so that the DNS will be set up.
When everything is working, your site will be added to the web pages.

<P>Multiple official sites can be set up in each country. In large countries, like
the US, and countries with more than one major backbone that aren't well connected,
like Australia, it is even a good idea. The first site will be given the aliases
ftp.<country>.debian.org and ftp1.<country>.debian.org (similarly for www). Future
sites will simply be given an alias of the second type with the number incremented
appropriately.
