<p>Setting up a push server consists of two basic tasks: setting up rsync
access (for normal, <q>pull</q> mirroring) and setting up ssh trigger mechanism
(for <q>pushing</q> the pull mirroring).
</p>

<p><small>(For more information on what a push server is, please read
<a href="push_mirroring">the explanation of push mirroring</a>.)</small>

<toc-add-entry name="rsync">Setting up rsync</toc-add-entry>

<p>Install <code>rsync</code> 2.1.1 or greater. If your site is running
Debian, just install the latest
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/rsync">rsync</a> package.
</p>

<p>Create <code>rsyncd.conf</code> file and put something similar to this
in it:
</p>

<pre>
uid = nobody
gid = nogroup
max connections = 25
socket options = SO_KEEPALIVE

[debian]
  path = /srv/debian/mirror
  comment = The Debian Archive (~250 GB)
  auth users = authorized_account1,authorized_account2,authorized_accountN
  read only = true
  secrets file = /etc/rsyncd/debian.secrets
</pre>

<p>Add an entry for each site you are pushing to in the
<code>/etc/rsyncd/debian.secrets</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
authorized_account1:a_password
authorized_account2:another_password
authorized_accountN:password
</pre>

<p>You have now given the downstream mirrors access to the archive on your
machine.
</p>

<p>You will probably want to start the rsync daemon from inetd. To do this,
you have to add rsync service in <code>/etc/services</code> file (if it
isn't already there), like this:
</p>

<pre>
rsync           873/tcp
</pre>

<p>
To enable the daemon from inetd, add the following to your
<code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
rsync      stream      tcp         nowait      root /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon
</pre>

<p>
(Remember to send inetd an HUP signal to tell it to reread its config file
after modifying the file.)
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="sshtrigger">Setting up ssh trigger mechanism</toc-add-entry>

<p>Create a new ssh key for the account that you use to mirror Debian. Make
sure you don't overwrite your original ssh key by using the -f option, for
example:
</p>

<pre>
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/identity.mysite
</pre>

<p>Make sure that the new public key (~/.ssh/identity.mysite.pub) contains
this at the beginning:
</p>

<pre>
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty,command="~/sync &amp;"
</pre>

<p>You need to set up a script that will contact the downstream mirrors.
Create a file called <code>signal</code>, containing this:
</p>

<protect>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# This script is called to signal the remote host that it is time to
# mirror the archive.

echo Signalling $1
ssh -o"BatchMode yes" -o"user $2" "$1" -i $HOME/.ssh/identity.mysite sleep 1
</pre>
</protect>

<p>This script will login to a remote host using the special ssh key you
created above, provided that each downstream mirror operator adds that
key to their own ~/.ssh/authorized_keys (also replacing <q>sync</q> with
<q>ftpsync</q> or whatever their command to start the mirroring is called).
The script itself will not do anything useful remotely, the single command
will be run as specified by the key setting.</p>

<p>To actually signal the mirrors, you need to run <code>./signal
&lt;site&gt; &lt;username&gt;</code> after your own rsyncing is done.
Thus, as soon as your site is finished mirroring from your upstream site,
you will start pushing to those downstream from you.
</p>

<p>You can place these commands either at the end of your
<code>ftpsync</code> script, or if it's more convenient for you, in a new
script, and then run that script from <code>ftpsync</code>, for example:
</p>

<protect>
<pre>
#!/bin/sh

# This script is called by websync to signal the downstream mirrors.

./signal some.other.site archvsync
./signal and.another.site othersiteaccount
</pre>
</protect>
