<p>Setting up a push server consists of two basic tasks: setting up rsync
access (for normal, <q>pull</q> mirroring) and setting up ssh trigger mechanism
(for <q>pushing</q> the pull mirroring).
</p>

<p><small>(For more information on what a push server is, please read
<a href="push_mirroring">the explanation of push mirroring</a>.)</small>

<toc-add-entry name="rsync">Setting up rsync</toc-add-entry>

<p>Install <code>rsync</code> 2.1.1 or greater. If your site is running
Debian, just install the latest
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/net/rsync">rsync</a> package.
</p>

<p>Create <code>rsyncd.conf</code> file and put something similar to this
in it:
</p>

<pre>
uid = nobody
gid = nogroup
max connections = 25
socket options = SO_KEEPALIVE

[debian]
  path = /srv/debian/mirror
  comment = The Debian Archive (~250 GB)
  auth users = authorized_account1,authorized_account2,authorized_accountN
  read only = true
  secrets file = /etc/rsyncd/debian.secrets
</pre>

<p>Add an entry for each site you are pushing to in the
<code>/etc/rsyncd/debian.secrets</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
authorized_account1:a_password
authorized_account2:another_password
authorized_accountN:password
</pre>

<p>You have now given the downstream mirrors access to the archive on your
machine.
</p>

<p>You will probably want to start the rsync daemon from inetd. To do this,
you have to add rsync service in <code>/etc/services</code> file (if it
isn't already there), like this:
</p>

<pre>
rsync           873/tcp
</pre>

<p>
To enable the daemon from inetd, add the following to your
<code>/etc/inetd.conf</code> file:
</p>

<pre>
rsync      stream      tcp         nowait      root /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon
</pre>

<p>
(Remember to send inetd an HUP signal to tell it to reread its config file
after modifying the file.)
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="sshtrigger">Setting up ssh trigger mechanism</toc-add-entry>

<p>Create a new ssh key for the account that you use to mirror Debian. Make
sure you don't overwrite your original ssh key by using the -f option, for
example:
</p>

<pre>
ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/identity.mysite
</pre>

<p>Make sure that the new public key (~/.ssh/identity.mysite.pub) contains
this at the beginning, with IPADDRESS being the IP of your upstream mirror:
</p>

<pre>
no-port-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty,command="~/bin/ftpsync",from="IPADDRESS"
</pre>

<p>You need to set up a script that will contact the downstream mirrors.
The ftpsync tarball contains the script <code>runmirrors</code> which is handling all
needed tasks for you. Simply change your ftpsync.conf to include the setting
<code>HUB=true</code>, copy the <code>runmirrors.conf.sample</code> to
<code>runmirrors.conf</code> and <code>runmirrors.mirror.sample</code> to
<code>runmirrors.mirror</code> and configure the config file to suit your system.
Then list all your downstream mirrors inside runmirrors.mirror and the ftpsync/runmirror
duo will do all the heavy lifting for you.
</p>

<p>The effect will be that your system will try to ssh to your downstream mirrors,
after your own mirror updated, so they can start their own updates. This assumes
you gave your downstream mirror operators the ssh key you told runmirrors to use
and that they added it to their own ~/.ssh/authorized_keys as described above.
