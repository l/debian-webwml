#use wml::debian::template title="Debian worldwide mirror sites" BARETITLE=true

<p>Debian is distributed (<em>mirrored</em>) on hundreds of
servers on the Internet. Using a nearby server will probably speed up
your download, and also reduce the load on our central servers and
on the Internet as a whole.</p>

<p>Debian mirrors can be primary and secondary. The definitions are
as follows:</p>

<p class="centerblock">
  A <strong>primary mirror</strong> site has good bandwidth, is available
  24 hours a day, and has an easy to remember name of the form
  ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org.
  <br />
  They are all automatically updated whenever there are updates to
  the Debian archive.
</p>

<p class="centerblock">
  A <strong>secondary mirror</strong> site may have restrictions on what
  they mirror (due to space restrictions).
  Just because a site is secondary doesn't necessarily mean it'll be
  any slower or less up to date than a primary site.
</p>

<p>Use the site closest to you for the fastest downloads possible
whether it is a primary or secondary site.
The program
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/net/netselect">\
<em>netselect</em></a> can be used to
determine the site with the least latency; use a download program such as
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/web/wget">\
<em>wget</em></a> or
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/net/rsync">\
<em>rsync</em></a> for determining the site with the most throughput.
Note that geographic proximity often isn't the most important factor for
determining which machine will serve you best.</p>

<p>
If you don't know which mirror to use or your system moves around a lot, you
can use the <a href="http://httpredir.debian.org/">mirror redirector service</a>
in your apt sources.list.
It dynamically redirects package download requests to the best mirror
available based on a number of factors such as mirror availability,
location, architecture and freshness.
Use this address in your
<a href="http://manpages.debian.org/man/5/sources.list">sources.list</a>
to use the mirror redirector:
</p>

<code>
http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
</code>
