#use wml::debian::template title="Mirroring"

<P>The world is a big place and without the large number of
mirrors around the world many people would have
difficulty acquiring Debian.

<P>Of course, that means that we need people to create and maintain
these mirrors. That means you. If you are in a position to donate disk
space and connectivity to making Debian more accessible, then this
page is for you.

<p>There are two types of Debian mirrors, <em>official</em> and
<em>unofficial</em>. <a href="types">Read more about the mirror types</a>.
The <a href="size">mirror size</a> is also an important factor in
determining whether and how to mirror Debian.

<P>The Debian FTP archive contains all the packages, source and installation
material. You can mirror the FTP archive, in part or as a whole. See the
pages on <a href="ftpmirror">setting up an FTP mirror</a> for more
information on methods of mirroring, how to do partial mirroring, when to
mirror and more.

<p>You can keep your mirror private, but most people choose to
<a href="submit">add their mirror site to our database</a> which contains
information about all of our mirrors. This is a good way to make a mirror
known, since the users can see it in the
<a href="../misc/README.mirrors">list of Debian mirrors</a> and the
<a href="../misc/README.non-US">list of mirrors of Debian non-US packages</a>.
A <a href="mirrors_full">thorough listing</a> is also provided for the
mirror maintainers to be able to discern the best sites to mirror from.

<p>Currently we do not require any mirrors for the web site (although any
new applications will be duly considered). But if you are already hosting a
mirror of our web pages, check the <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a> pages
for reference.

<p>One of the developers has made a script to check the timestamp files,
which are used to determine how recently has a mirror been updated, and
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~md/mirrors-list.txt">outputs the dates</a>,
if they are available.
