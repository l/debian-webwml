#use wml::debian::template title="Mirroring"

<P>The world is a big place and without the large number of
mirrors around the world many people would have
difficulty acquiring Debian.

<P>Of course, that means that we need people to create and maintain
these mirrors. That means you. If you are in a position to donate some disk
space and connectivity to making Debian more accessible, then this
page is for you.

<P>The Debian FTP archive contains all the packages, source and installation
material. You can mirror the FTP archive, in part or as a whole. You can
even keep the mirror private, but most people choose to add FTP sites to the
<A HREF="../misc/README.mirrors">mirror list</A>.

<p>Currently we do not require any mirrors for the web site (although any
new applications will be duly considered). But if you are already hosting a
mirror of our web pages, check the <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a> pages
for reference.
