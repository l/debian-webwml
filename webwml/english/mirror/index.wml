<p>Debian is distributed all around the world using
<em><a href="http://foldoc.org/mirror+site">mirrors</a></em>
in order to provide users with better access to our archive and to reduce
the load on our servers.</p>

<p>
If you don't know which mirror to use or your system moves around a lot, you
can use the <a href="http://httpredir.debian.org/">mirror redirector service</a>
in your apt sources.list.
It dynamically redirects package download requests to the best mirror
available based on a number of factors such as mirror availability,
location, architecture and freshness.
Use this address in your
<a href="http://manpages.debian.org/man/5/sources.list">sources.list</a>
to use the mirror redirector:
</p>

<code>
http://httpredir.debian.org/debian
</code>

<p>The following Debian archives are mirrored:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Debian packages</strong> (<code>debian/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The Debian package pool -- this includes the vast majority of .deb
      packages, the installation materials and the sources.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="list">Debian mirrors that include the
      <code>debian/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>CD images</strong> (<code>debian-cd/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The repository of CD images: Jigdo files and ISO image files.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="$(HOME)/CD/http-ftp/">Debian mirrors that
      include the <code>debian-cd/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Old releases</strong> (<code>debian-archive/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The archive of old released versions of Debian.
      <br>
      See <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">Distribution Archives</a>
      for more information.
  </dd>

<h2>Information for mirror owners</h2>

<p>Debian mirrors are maintained by volunteers, so
if you are in a position to donate disk space and connectivity, create a
mirror and contribute to making Debian more accessible.</p>

<p>See the pages on <a href="ftpmirror">setting up a mirror of the Debian
archive</a> for more information on methods of mirroring, how to do partial
mirroring, when to mirror and more.</p>

<p>You can mirror the Debian archive in part or as a whole &mdash; check
the <a href="size">mirror size</a>.</p>

<p>You can keep your mirror private, but most people choose to
<a href="submit">add their mirror site to our database</a> which contains
information about all Debian mirrors. This is a good way to make a mirror
known, since the users can see it in our mirror lists.
Your organization also gets a mention at the <a href="sponsors">mirror
sponsors web page</a>.</p>

<p>If there isn't already an official Debian mirror in your country, and
your mirror has good bandwidth, you might want it to <a href="official">\
become an official mirror</a>.</p>

<p>There are two public <a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a> about
Debian mirrors,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-announce/">debian-mirrors-announce</a>
and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/">debian-mirrors</a>.
We encourage all mirror maintainers to subscribe to the announcement list as
it will be used for any important announcements. This list is moderated and will
receive only a low amount of traffic. The second mailing list is meant for general
discussion and is open to all.</p>

<p>Debian mirrors have timestamp files we use to determine how recently
they have been updated. Here are some statistics the mirror maintainers
provide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><url "http://mirror.debian.org/status.html"></li>
  <li><url "http://ftp.de.debian.org/dmc/today/"></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions that aren't answered on these web pages, you
can contact us at <email mirrors@debian.org> or using IRC, #debian-mirrors on
<tt>irc.debian.org</tt>.</p>
