#use wml::debian::template title="Mirroring Debian" BARETITLE="true"

<p>The world is a big place and without <a href="../misc/README.mirrors">the
large number of mirrors around the world</a>, many people would have
difficulty acquiring Debian. Debian mirrors are maintained by volunteers, so
if you are in a position to donate disk space and connectivity, create a
mirror and make Debian more accessible.</p>

<p>The Debian FTP archive contains all the packages, source and installation
material. You can mirror the FTP archive in part or as a whole &mdash; check
the <a href="size">mirror size</a>. See the pages on <a href="ftpmirror">\
setting up an FTP mirror</a> for more information on methods of mirroring,
how to do partial mirroring, when to mirror and more.</p>

<p>You can keep your mirror private, but most people choose to
<a href="submit">add their mirror site to our database</a> which contains
information about all of our mirrors. This is a good way to make a mirror
known, since the users can see it in the
<a href="../misc/README.mirrors">list of Debian mirrors</a> and the
<a href="../misc/README.non-US">list of mirrors of Debian non-US packages</a>.
A <a href="mirrors_full">thorough listing</a> is also provided for the
mirror maintainers to be able to discern the best sites to mirror from.

<p>If there isn't already an official Debian mirror in your country, and
your mirror has good bandwidth, you might want it to <a href="official">\
become an official mirror</a>.

<p>Currently we do not require any new mirrors for the web site (although
any applications will be duly considered). But if you are already hosting a
mirror of our web pages, check the <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a> pages
for reference.

<p>Debian mirrors have timestamp files we use to determine how recently have
they been updated. Here are some statistics the mirror maintainers have
provided:</p>

can contact us at <email mirrors@debian.org>.</p>
