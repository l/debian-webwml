<p>Debian is distributed all around the world using mirrors
in order to provide users with better access to our archive.</p>

<p>The following Debian archives are mirrored:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Debian packages</strong> (<code>debian/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The Debian package pool -- this includes the vast majority of .deb
      packages, the installation materials and the sources.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="list">Debian mirrors that include the
      <code>debian/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>CD images</strong> (<code>debian-cd/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The repository of CD images: Jigdo files and ISO image files.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="$(HOME)/CD/http-ftp/">Debian mirrors that
      include the <code>debian-cd/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Old releases</strong> (<code>debian-archive/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The archive of old released versions of Debian.
      <br>
      See <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">Distribution Archives</a>
      for more information.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Information for mirror owners</h2>

<p>Debian mirrors are maintained by volunteers, so if there are no good mirrors
near you and you are in a position to donate disk space and connectivity,
consider creating a mirror and contribute to making Debian more accessible.
See the pages on <a href="ftpmirror">setting up a mirror of the Debian
archive</a> for more information about mirroring.</p>
