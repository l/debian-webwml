<p>Debian is distributed all around the world using
<em><a href="http://foldoc.org/?query=mirror+site">mirrors</a></em>
in order to provide users with better access to our archive and to reduce
the load on our servers.</p>

<p>The following Debian archives are mirrored:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Debian packages</strong> (<code>debian/</code>)
  <dd>The Debian package pool -- this includes the vast majority of .deb
      packages, the installation materials and the sources.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="list">Debian mirrors that include the
      <code>debian/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>CD images</strong> (<code>debian-cd/</code>)
  <dd>The repository of CD images: Jigdo files and ISO image files.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="$(HOME)/CD/http-ftp/">Debian mirrors that
      include the <code>debian-cd/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Old releases</strong> (<code>debian-archive/</code>)
  <dd>The archive of old released versions of Debian.
      <br>
      See <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">Distribution Archives</a>
      for more information.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>WWW pages</strong>
  <dd>The main Debian website.
      <br>
      The <a href="webmirror">Debian web mirrors</a> provide <a href="$(HOME)">http://www.debian.org/</a> around the globe.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>Prior to Debian 3.1, there was also a <em>Non-US packages</em> archive
(<code>debian-non-US/</code>) which included Debian packages that could
not be distributed in the United States due to software patents or use
of encryption. These packages were incorporated into the main archive
in Debian 3.1 and the non-US archive is discontinued.</p>

<h2>Information for mirror owners</h2>

<p>Debian mirrors are maintained by volunteers, so
if you are in a position to donate disk space and connectivity, create a
mirror and contribute to making Debian more accessible.</p>

<p>See the pages on <a href="ftpmirror">setting up a mirror of the Debian
archive</a> for more information on methods of mirroring, how to do partial
mirroring, when to mirror and more.</p>

<p>You can mirror the Debian archive in part or as a whole &mdash; check
the <a href="size">mirror size</a>.</p>

<p>You can keep your mirror private, but most people choose to
<a href="submit">add their mirror site to our database</a> which contains
information about all Debian mirrors. This is a good way to make a mirror
known, since the users can see it in our mirror lists.
Your organization also gets a mention at the <a href="sponsors">mirror
sponsors web page</a>.</p>

<p>If there isn't already an official Debian mirror in your country, and
your mirror has good bandwidth, you might want it to <a href="official">\
become an official mirror</a>.</p>

<p>There are two public <a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a> about
Debian mirrors,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-announce/">debian-mirrors-announce</a>
and
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/">debian-mirrors</a>.
We encourage all mirror maintainers to subscribe to the announcement list as
it will be used for any important announcements. This list is moderated and will
receive only a low amount of traffic. The second mailing list is meant for general
discussion and is open to all.</p>

<p>Currently we do not require any new mirrors for the web site (although
any applications will be duly considered). But if you are already hosting a
mirror of our web pages, check the <a href="webmirror">web mirror</a> pages
for reference.</p>

<p>Debian mirrors have timestamp files we use to determine how recently have
they been updated. Here are some statistics the mirror maintainers have
provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li><url "http://mirror.debian.org/status.html"></li>
  <li><url "http://ftp.de.debian.org/dmc/today/"></li>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions that aren't answered on these web pages, you
can contact us at <email mirrors@debian.org> or using IRC, #debian-mirrors on
<tt>irc.debian.org</tt>.</p>
