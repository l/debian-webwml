<p>Debian is distributed all around the world using
<em><a href="http://foldoc.org/mirror+site">mirrors</a></em>
in order to provide users with better access to our archive.</p>

<p>The following Debian archives are mirrored:</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Debian packages</strong> (<code>debian/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The Debian package pool -- this includes the vast majority of .deb
      packages, the installation materials and the sources.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="list">Debian mirrors that include the
      <code>debian/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>CD images</strong> (<code>debian-cd/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The repository of CD images: Jigdo files and ISO image files.
      <br>
      See the list of <a href="$(HOME)/CD/http-ftp/">Debian mirrors that
      include the <code>debian-cd/</code> archive</a>.
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Old releases</strong> (<code>debian-archive/</code>)</dt>
  <dd>The archive of old released versions of Debian.
      <br>
      See <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/archive">Distribution Archives</a>
      for more information.

<h2>Information for mirror owners</h2>

<p>Debian mirrors are maintained by volunteers, so if there are no good mirrors
near you and you are in a position to donate disk space and connectivity,
consider creating a mirror and contribute to making Debian more accessible.
See the pages on <a href="ftpmirror">setting up a mirror of the Debian
archive</a> for more information mirroring.</p>

<p>There are two public <a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a> about
Debian mirrors,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-announce/">debian-mirrors-announce</a>
and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/">debian-mirrors</a>.
We encourage all mirror maintainers to subscribe to the announcement list as
it will be used for any important announcements. This list is moderated and will
receive only a low amount of traffic. The second mailing list is meant for general
discussion and is open to all.</p>

<p>If you have any questions that aren't answered on these web pages, you
can contact us at <email mirrors@debian.org> or using IRC, #debian-mirrors on
<tt>irc.debian.org</tt>.</p>
