#use wml::debian::template title="Push Mirroring"

<p>Push mirroring is a form of mirroring using rsync that minimizes the time
it takes for changes to the main archive to reach mirrors. The server mirror
uses a triggering mechanism to inform the client mirror it needs to be
updated.

<p>Push mirroring takes a little more effort to set up since the maintainers
of the upstream and downstream mirror must exchange information. The benefit
is that the upstream mirror initiates the mirror process immediately after
its archive has been updated. This allows changes to the archive to
propagate extremely quickly.

<h2>Explanation of the method</h2>

<p>First some background on ssh. Ssh allows people to connect to accounts
on different machines in a secure way. Not only are passwords never passed
in the clear, once you connect to a machine you are basically guaranteed that
future connections will be to the same machine. This prevents many man-in-the-middle
attacks.

<p>One capability ssh has is the ability for a user to take the public identity
key for a user on another machine and add it to a file of authorized keys on your
machine. By default, the user on the other machine (who has the private identity
key associated with the public identity key given to you)
then has login privileges to your account. It is possible, though, to add text
to an authorized key restricting the type of access a person accessing your
account using that key has.

<p>So to protect the downstream mirror, the key provided by the upstream mirror
has text added to it to limit it to only give the person accessing your account
permission to do one thing - start the program on your machine that updates
your mirror. Even if someone (an evil third party) was able to break the key,
the most they could do is to start the mirror program on your machine. 
You do not even have to worry about multiple copies of the program being started
as a lockfile is used.

<p>On the upstream end, rsync can be configured to restrict who can mirror
a given area by username and password. These are totally separate from <kbd>/etc/passwd</kbd>
so a push server doesn't have to worry about giving others access to their machine.
As it is set up, the username and password are passed in the clear. This
shouldn't be a problem though, as the worst that can happen is that a
third party gains the ability to mirror the Debian pages from that site.

<h2>Setting up a push client mirror</h2>

<p>It is best to set this up using the account of an ordinary user, not
root. The contents of the public ssh key given to you by the upstream mirror
should be placed in <kbd>~&lt;user&gt;/.ssh/authorized_keys</kbd>.

<p>To become a push client for the FTP archive, you will need the files
<a href="ftpsync">ftpsync</a> and <a href="ftpsync.conf">ftpsync.conf</a>.
Edit ftpsync.conf and follow the directions in there using
the information provided to you by the upstream mirror.

# The files have different names so that you may use the same account to
# mirror both archives.

<p>To become a push client for the WWW pages, you will need the files
<a href="websync">websync</a> and <a href="websync.conf">websync.conf</a>.
Edit websync.conf and follow the directions in there using the information
provided to you by the upstream mirror.

<h2>Push-Primary client sites</h2>

<p>Push-Primary client mirrors, also referred to as Tier-1 mirrors, are the
push client mirrors which are allowed to mirror from our master archives.

<p>If your site is <strong>very</strong> well connected (both very good
bandwidth and well connected to major backbones) and you are willing to let
other sites mirror from your site, you may want to let us know so we can
consider you for a push mirror. However, don't expect it to happen very soon
because we already have a fair number of Tier-1 mirrors.

<p>If your site is becoming a Push-Primary for the FTP archive, you will
need the <a href="id_rsa.pub.ftp-master">public SSH2 key for
archvsync@ftp-master.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>If your site is becoming a Push-Primary for the WWW pages, you will need
the <a href="id_dsa.pub.www-master">public SSH2 key for
archvsync@www-master.debian.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Setting up a push server mirror</h2>

<p>Given the large number of mirrors and the size of the Debian archive, it
is not feasible for all the mirrors to use the master archive site as the
upstream source for Debian (i.e. their push server mirror). It is much more
efficient if the load is distributed among a number of push mirrors
distributed throughout the globe.

<p>Push server mirrors should be push client mirrors of the master archive
(or perhaps another push server), and they should contain a mirror of the
entire Debian archive.

<p>See the <a href="push_server">details on setting up a push server</a>.
