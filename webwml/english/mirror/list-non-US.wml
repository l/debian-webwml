<h1 align="center">Debian non-US packages</h1>

<p>Prior to the release of Debian 3.1, United States laws placed
restrictions on the export of certain defense articles, which,
unfortunately, included some types of cryptographic software.
PGP and SSH, among others, fell into this category.
It was legal however, to import such software into the US.</p>

<p>To prevent anyone from taking unnecessary legal risks, some Debian
packages were only available from a site in Leiden, The Netherlands, until 
the release of Debian 3.1, which incorporates this software thanks to
changes in United States law.</p>

<p>You should not need the non-US archive unless you are using a version of
Debian from before Debian 3.1.</p>

<p>Available access methods are:</p>

<blockquote>
	<url "ftp://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/">
	<br />
	<url "http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/">
	<br />
	rsync://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US/  (limited)
</blockquote>

<p>To use these packages with APT, you can add the following lines to your
sources.list file:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://non-us.debian.org/debian-non-US stable/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>

<p>Read sources.list(5) on your Debian system for more information.</p>
