<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of 21 January 2002.

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 40 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>Debian 2.2 (current stable release, `potato')</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 9 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture (from stable, testing and unstable)</strong></dt>
  <dd>ranges from 2.6 GB to 4.2 GB (roughly)</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>on average 1.5 GB and growing</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.

<p>You can also see <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/~mmagallo/">graphs
of Debian archive size growth</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian non-US FTP site?</h3>

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 2.6 GB. 100-180 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.

<h2>How big are the web pages?</h2>

<p>The mirrored portion of our web pages (www.debian.org) is roughly
650 MB.</p>
