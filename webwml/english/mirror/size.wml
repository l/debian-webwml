Note that unstable will grow as a release approaches. If the same version is in both
stable and unstable, the version in unstable will be a symlink to the one in stable.

<h4>sid (this is where unreleased ports of Debian are kept)</h4>
roughly 1100000 sid (and growing)
<br>It will shrink whenever a new port is released. Of course, that means the
stable and unstable parts of the archive will grow.


<h3>How big are the web pages?</h3>

<h4>whole thing</h4>
roughly 2200000

<h4>Parts that not all mirrors mirror:</h4>
<pre>
 310000  Bugs
1400000  Lists-Archives (and growing)
