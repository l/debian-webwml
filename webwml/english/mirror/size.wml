Note that unstable will grow as a release approaches. If the same version is in both
stable and unstable, the version in unstable will be a symlink to the one in stable.

roughly 2 GB (and growing)
<br>It will shrink whenever a new port is released. Of course, that means the
stable and unstable parts of the archive will grow.
