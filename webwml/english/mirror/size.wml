<h2>How big is the Debian archive?</h2>

# (note for the English editors on how to update some of the numbers below)
# dak psql database on ftp-master is 'projectb'
# and there's a copy on merkel
# projectb=> select sum(files.size) from files,binaries,architecture
#            where architecture.id=binaries.architecture and
#            architecture.arch_string='i386' and files.id=binaries.file;
# projectb=> select architecture.arch_string as Architecture, sum(files.size)
#            from files,binaries,architecture where
#            architecture.id=binaries.architecture and files.id=binaries.file
#            group by architecture.arch_string;
# however, this might not work completely reliably, it will report smaller
# figures. dunno exactly why; asked elmo and he didn't have an answer.
# thankfully, later checks showed that the difference from the real thing
# is sufficiently small (<= 100 MB or so) to be ignored -joy

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of May 2007.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 235 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>architecture independent packages</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 20.5 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture</strong> (from oldstable, stable, testing and unstable)</dt>
  <dd>Ranging roughly from 12.8 GB to 19 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>Anywhere between 2 GB and 12 GB, but growing.</dd>

<dt><strong>sources</strong></dt>
  <dd>About 33 GB.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian CD archive?</h3>

<p>The CD archive varies greatly across mirrors &mdash; the Jigdo files are
around 100-150 MB per architecture, while the full DVD/CD images are
around 15 GB each, plus extra space for the 'update' CD images,
Bittorrent files, etc.</p>

<p>For more information about the CD archive mirroring, please see
the <a href="../CD/mirroring/">Debian CD mirror pages</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian non-US archive?</h3>

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 1.1 GB. 60-110 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.</p>

<p>(Note that the non-US archive is deprecated since 2005.)</p>

<h2>How big are the web pages?</h2>

<p>The mirrored portion of our web pages (www.debian.org) is roughly
2 GB.</p>
