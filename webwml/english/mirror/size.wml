<h2>How big is the Debian archive?</h2>

# psql -U nobody projectb
# projectb=> select sum(files.size) from files,binaries,architecture
#            where architecture.id=binaries.architecture and
#            architecture.arch_string='i386' and files.id=binaries.file;
# projectb=> select architecture.arch_string as Architecture, sum(files.size)
#            from files,binaries,architecture where
#            architecture.id=binaries.architecture and files.id=binaries.file
#            group by architecture.arch_string;

# however, this might not work completely reliably, it will report smaller
# figures. dunno exactly why, elmo didn't have a good answer.

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of December 2006.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 205 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>architecture independent packages</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 16.5 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture</strong> (from oldstable, stable, testing and unstable)</dt>
  <dd>Ranging rougly from 11.5 GB to 15.3 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>Anywhere between 1.6 GB and 11 GB, but growing.</dd>

<dt><strong>sources</strong></dt>
  <dd>About 27 GB.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian CD archive?</h3>

<p>The CD archive varies greatly across mirrors &mdash; the Jigdo files are
around 50 MB per architecture, while the full DVD/CD images are around 9 GB
each, plus extra space for the 'update' CD images, Bittorrent files, etc.</p>

<p>For more information about the CD archive mirroring, please see
the <a href="../CD/mirroring/">Debian CD mirror pages</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian non-US archive?</h3>

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 1.1 GB. 60-110 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.</p>

<p>(Note that the non-US archive is deprecated since 2005.)</p>

<h2>How big are the web pages?</h2>

<p>The mirrored portion of our web pages (www.debian.org) is roughly
2 GB.</p>
