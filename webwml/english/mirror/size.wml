<h3>How big is the Debian FTP site?</h3>

# psql -U nobody projectb
# projectb=> select sum(files.size) from files,binaries,architecture
#            where architecture.id=binaries.architecture and
#            architecture.arch_string='i386' and files.id=binaries.file;
# projectb=> select architecture.arch_string as Architecture, sum(files.size)
#            from files,binaries,architecture where
#            architecture.id=binaries.architecture and files.id=binaries.file
#            group by architecture.arch_string;

# however, this might not work completely reliably, it will report smaller
# figures. dunno exactly why, elmo didn't have a good answer.

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of 31 July 2001.

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 32 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>Debian 2.2 (current stable release, `potato')</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 9 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>ranges from 2.3 GB to 3.7 GB (roughly)</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>on average almost one GB and growing</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.

<h3>How big is the Debian non-US FTP site?</h3>

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 550 MB. 38-65 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.

<h3>How big are the web pages?</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>www.debian.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 440 MB</dd>

<dt><strong>lists.debian.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 3.2 GB</dd>

<dt><strong>packages.debian.org</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 150 MB</dd>
</dl>

<p>All of these sizes are growing constantly, but at slower pace than the
FTP site.
