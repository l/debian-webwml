<h2>How big is the Debian archive?</h2>

# (note for the English editors on how to update some of the numbers below)
# dak psql database on ftp-master is 'projectb'
# and there's a copy on merkel
# projectb=> select architecture.arch_string as Architecture,
#            sum(files.size)/1024/1024/1024 as Size
#            from files,binaries,architecture
#            where architecture.id=binaries.architecture
#            and files.id=binaries.file
#            group by architecture.arch_string
#            order by Size;
# projectb=> select sum(size)/1024/1024/1024 from files where
#            filename ~ '.diff.gz$' or filename ~ '.dsc$'
#            or filename ~ '.orig.tar.gz$';
# projectb=> select sum(files.size)/1024/1024/1024
#            from files, binaries, architecture
#            where architecture.id=binaries.architecture
#            and files.id=binaries.file
#            and architecture.arch_string='i386';

# wc -c'ing files inside the debian/ directory might occasionally give
# slightly different results than the SQL queries, but the difference
# is usually negligible -joy

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of March 2008.</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 335 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>architecture independent packages</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 28 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture</strong> (from oldstable, stable, testing and unstable)</dt>
  <dd>Ranging roughly from 18 GB to 25 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>Anywhere between 2.5 GB and 14 GB, but growing.</dd>

<dt><strong>sources</strong></dt>
  <dd>About 43 GB.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian CD archive?</h3>

<p>The CD archive varies greatly across mirrors &mdash; the Jigdo files are
around 100-150 MB per architecture, while the full DVD/CD images are
around 15 GB each, plus extra space for the <q>update</q> CD images,
Bittorrent files, etc.</p>

<p>For more information about the CD archive mirroring, please see
the <a href="../CD/mirroring/">Debian CD mirror pages</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian Security archive?</h3>

<p>The debian-security archive is around 38 GB.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian Volatile archive?</h3>

<p>The debian-volatile archive is around 3 GB.</p>

<h2>How big are the regular updates to the mirrors?</h2>

<p>For the main Debian archive, please see
