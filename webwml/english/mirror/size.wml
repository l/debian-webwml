# psql -U nobody projectb

# however, this might not work completely reliably, it will report smaller

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of 21 April 2004.

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 100 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture (from stable, testing and unstable)</strong></dt>
  <dd>ranges from 5.5 GB to 8 GB (roughly), architecture independent
        packages also take roughly 8 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>
  <dd>on average 0.6 GB but growing.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.

<h3>How big is the Debian non-US FTP site?</h3>

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 1.1 GB. 60-110 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.

<h2>How big are the web pages?</h2>

<p>The mirrored portion of our web pages (www.debian.org) is roughly
950 MB.</p>
