<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures instead,
according to their <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/">popularity</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian CD archive?</h3>

<p>The CD archive varies greatly across mirrors &mdash; the Jigdo files are
around 100-150 MB per architecture, while the full DVD/CD images are
around 15 GB each, plus extra space for the <q>update</q> CD images,
Bittorrent files, etc.</p>

<p>For more information about the CD archive mirroring, please see
the <a href="../CD/mirroring/">Debian CD mirror pages</a>.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian Security archive?</h3>

<p>The debian-security archive is around 44 GB.</p>

<h3>How big is the Debian Backports archive?</h3>

<p>The debian-backports archive is around 55 GB.</p>

<h2>How big are the regular updates to the mirrors?</h2>
