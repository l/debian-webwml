<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of 23 April 2001.

<dl>
<dt><strong>the whole thing</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 24 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>Debian 2.2 (current stable release, `potato')</strong></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 9 GB.</dd>

<dt><strong>a released architecture</strong></dt>

<dt><strong>an unreleased architecture</strong></dt>

<p>Note that the archive is constantly growing; testing will grow especially
as a release approaches. Also, we do not recommend reducing size of a mirror
by excluding specific distributions; exclude specific architectures or even
sources instead.

<p>The whole non-US archive is roughly 550 MB. 38-65 MB per released
architecture, a bit less for each unreleased architecture.
