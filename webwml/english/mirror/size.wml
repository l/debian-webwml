<h3>How big is the Debian FTP site?</h3>

<p>Numbers on this page are from the archive as of 2 Oct 2000.

<dl>
<p><dt><b>the whole thing</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 16 GB (and growing).</dd>

<p><dt><b>Debian 2.2 (current stable release, codenamed potato)</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 7.3 GB.</dd>

<p><dt><b>current unstable (codenamed woody)</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 5.8 GB.

  <p>Note that unstable will grow as a release approaches. If the same
  version is in both stable and unstable, the version in unstable will be
  a symlink to the one in stable.
  </dd>

<p><dt><b>unreleased ports (codename sid)</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 1.9 GB

  <p>sid will shrink whenever a new port is released. Of course, that means
  the stable and unstable parts of the archive will grow.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>How big are the web pages?</h3>

<dl>
<p><dt><b>www.debian.org</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 882 MB

  <p>Not all mirrors mirror Bugs/, which takes up about 410 MB of the above
  (and that part may dissappear or shrink soon, even).

  <p>If a mirror does not mirror a particular subdirectory, they must use a
  redirect to another site so that all links will work.
  </dd>

<p><dt><b>lists.debian.org</b></dt>
  <dd>Roughly 2.4 GB (and growing)</dd>
</dl>
