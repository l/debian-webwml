<p>Official Debian archive mirrors get an address of the form
ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org. These are the best advertised
and most used sites; the face of Debian for most people.</p>

<p>This is the current list of official Debian archive mirrors:</p>

<officialarchivemirrors>

<p>If there isn't already a ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org for
your country, you can apply for one. Your donation would be suitably
acknowledged on our <a href="official_sponsors">web pages</a>.</p>

<p>To become an official mirror, your site should meet the following
criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The site must be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine must
	not be heavily loaded.
    <li>It must have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective country).
	Bandwidth equivalent to a T1 connection or better is preferred;
        note that for developed countries, this minimum is much higher.
    <li>The routers in front of the server shouldn't have any global
        access bans or major limitations of bandwidth.
    <li>The server needs to be able to sustain the traffic, i.e. have
        reasonable limits on the HTTP, FTP and rsync daemons, including
        tuning the maximum number of connections in general and the maximum
        number of connections from a single IP.
    <li>Disk space commitments (with room for expansion) -- see the
	<a href="size">mirror size page</a>.
    <li>The whole Debian archive should be mirrored, using a method that
	preserves time stamps of mirrored files (e.g. rsync) so that the
	times on files (UTC) match those on ftp.debian.org.
    <li>The mirror hierarchy must be available under <kbd>/debian</kbd> (and
	<kbd>/debian-non-US</kbd> if you mirror the non-US site, too).
	Rationale: for consistency between sites &mdash; you may simply
	place a symlink if you want to keep the mirror somewhere else, or
        set up a virtual host.
    <li>The mirror should be made available at least via these protocols:
        <ul>
            <li>FTP (ftp://<var>your.server</var>/debian/)
                <br>
                FTP is the most senior and still very widely used file
                transfer protocol.
            </li>
            <li>HTTP (http://<var>your.server</var>/debian/)
                <br>
                HTTP is used because with HTTP/1.1 transfers have the
                potential of being more efficient than with FTP.
            </li>
            <li>rsync (rsync://<var>your.server</var>::debian/)
                <br>
                Rsync is the preferred method of mirroring, and one of
                the main functions of an official mirror is to help the
                proliferation of secondary mirrors.
            </li>
        </ul>
    <li>The mirror must be updated at least once a day, and the time of
	updating should be noted with a timestamp file in the project/trace/
	subdirectory of the mirror.
        <br>
        This means running
        <kbd>date -u &gt; .../debian/project/trace/<var>your.server</var></kbd>
        after your daily rsync is finished; and
        <kbd>date -u &gt; .../debian-non-US/project/trace/<var>your.server</var></kbd>
        after the non-US daily rsync is finished, if you mirror debian-non-US.
        <br>
        It's trivial to set up, doesn't waste much resources, but is useful
        in order to maintain a trace of mirroring.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that these are just guidelines, but we will be more likely to
accept your site as an official mirror if the above conditions are met. If
you are unsure of something, <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">ask us</a>.
</p>

<p>Register you mirror using the <a href="submit">mirror submission
form</a>. After that is processed, send e-mail requesting to become an
official site, including exact information on bandwidth consumption and
limits for your site, to <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">\
mirrors@debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>If possible, you should set up <a href="push_mirroring">push mirroring</a>
from another mirror, preferably one that is high in the mirror hierarchy
(Push-Primary or Push-Secondary).</p>

<p>Multiple official sites can be set up in each country, but only if there
is demand for such a thing. In large
countries, like the US, and countries with more than one major backbone that
aren't well connected, like Australia, it is even a good idea. The first
site will be given the aliases ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org and
ftp1.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org. Future sites will simply be given an alias
of the second type with the number incremented appropriately.</p>
