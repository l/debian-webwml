<p>Official Debian FTP mirrors get an address of the form
ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org. These are the best advertised
and most used sites; the face of Debian for most people.</p>

<p>The <a href="../distrib/ftplist">current list of official FTP mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If there isn't already a ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org for
your country, you can apply for one. Your donation would be suitably
acknowledged on our <a href="../donations">web site</a>.</p>

<p>To become an official mirror, your site should meet the following
criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The site must be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine must
	not be heavily loaded.
    <li>It must have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective country).
	Bandwidth equivalent to a T1 connection or better is preferred.
    <li>Disk space commitments (with room for expansion) -- see the
	<a href="size">mirror size page</a>.
    <li>The whole FTP archive should be mirrored, using a method that
	preserves time stamps of mirrored files (e.g. rsync) so that the
	times on files (UTC) match those on ftp.debian.org.
    <li>The mirror hierarchy must be available under /debian (and
	/debian-non-US if you mirror the non-US site, too).
	Rationale: for consistency between sites &mdash; you may simply
	place a symlink if you want to keep the mirror somewhere else.
    <li>The mirror should be made available using HTTP and rsync
	(ftp://ftp.site/debian/ should also be accessible as
	http://ftp.site/debian/ and rsync://ftp.site::debian/).
	Rationale: with HTTP/1.1, web transfers have the potential of being
	more efficient than with FTP, so we are trying to make a move in
	that direction. Rsync, on the other hand, is the preferred method of
	mirroring.
    <li>The mirror must be updated at least once a day, and the time of
	updating should be noted with a timestamp file in the project/trace/
	subdirectory of the mirror.
</ul>

<p>Please note that these are just guidelines, but we will be more likely to
accept your site as an official mirror if the above conditions are met. If
you are unsure of something, <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">ask us</a>.
</p>

<p>Register you mirror using the <a href="submit">mirror submission
form</a>. After that is processed, send e-mail requesting to become an
official site, including exact information on bandwidth consumption and
limits for your site, to <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">\
mirrors@debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>If possible, <a href="push_mirroring">push mirroring</a> should be set up
from Debian sites.</p>

<p>Multiple official sites can be set up in each country. In large
countries, like the US, and countries with more than one major backbone that
aren't well connected, like Australia, it is even a good idea. The first
site will be given the aliases ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org and
ftp1.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org. Future sites will simply be given an alias
of the second type with the number incremented appropriately.</p>
