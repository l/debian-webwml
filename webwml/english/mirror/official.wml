<p>Official Debian archive mirrors get an address of the form
ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org. These are the best advertised
and most used sites; the face of Debian for most people.</p>

<p>This is the current list of official Debian archive mirrors:</p>

<officialarchivemirrors>

<p>The sponsors of the official mirrors are specially
<a href="official_sponsors">acknowledged on our web pages</a>.</p>

<p>If there isn't already an ftp.<var>&lt;country&gt;</var>.debian.org for
your country, you can apply for one. To become an official mirror, your site
should meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The site should be reliable and be up 24 hours a day. The machine should
	not be heavily loaded.</li>
    <li>It should have a decent connectivity (relative to the respective country).
	Bandwidth equivalent to a T1 connection or better is preferred;
        note that for developed countries, this minimum is much higher.</li>
    <li>The routers in front of the server shouldn't have any global
        access bans or major limitations of bandwidth.</li>
    <li>The server needs to be able to sustain the traffic, i.e. have
        reasonable limits on the HTTP, FTP and rsync daemons, including
        tuning the maximum number of connections in general and the maximum
        number of connections from a single IP.</li>
    <li>Disk space commitments (with room for expansion) &mdash; see the
	<a href="size">mirror size page</a>.</li>
    <li>The whole Debian archive should be mirrored.</li>
    <li>The mirror hierarchy should be available under <kbd>/debian</kbd>.
	Rationale: for consistency between sites &mdash; you may simply
	place a symlink if you want to keep the mirror somewhere else, or
        set up a virtual host.</li>
    <li>The mirror should be made available at least via these protocols:
        <ul>
            <li>HTTP (http://<var>your.server</var>/debian/)
                <br />
                HTTP is used because with HTTP/1.1 transfers have the
                potential of being more efficient than with FTP.
            </li>
            <li>FTP (ftp://<var>your.server</var>/debian/)
                <br />
		FTP is the most senior protocol, and still very widely used.
            </li>
            <li>rsync (rsync://<var>your.server</var>::debian/)
                <br />
                Rsync is the preferred method of mirroring, and one of
                the main functions of an official mirror is to help the
                proliferation of secondary mirrors.
            </li>
        </ul></li>
    <li>The mirror should be updated with <a href="anonftpsync">anonftpsync</a>,
        a script which provides these important functions:
        <ul>
          <li>It uses rsync and preserves time stamps of mirrored files, so
              that the times on files (UTC) match those on the rest of the
              mirror network.</li>
          <li>An additional timestamp file with the name of the mirror in the
              <kbd>project/trace/</kbd> subdirectory of the mirror needs to exist.
              <br />
              This means running
              <kbd>date -u &gt; .../debian/project/trace/<var>your.server</var></kbd>
              after your daily rsync is finished.
              <br />
              It's trivial to set up, doesn't waste much resources, but is useful
              in order to maintain a trace of mirroring.</li>
          <li>The <kbd>/doc</kbd> tree and the <kbd>/project</kbd> tree
              need to be mirrored.</li>
        </ul></li>
    <li><a href="push_mirroring">Push mirroring</a> needs to be set up; feel free
	to contact us to get in touch with the maintainer of another mirror.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that these are just guidelines, but we will be more likely to
accept your site as an official mirror if the above conditions are met. If
you are unsure of something, <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">ask us</a>.
</p>

<p>Register your mirror using the <a href="submit">mirror submission
form</a>. After that is processed, send e-mail requesting to become an
official site, including exact information on bandwidth consumption and
limits for your site, to <a href="mailto:mirrors@debian.org">\
mirrors@debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>Multiple official sites can be set up in each country, but only if there
is demand for such a thing. In large
countries, like the US, and countries with more than one major backbone that
aren't well connected, like Australia, it is even a good idea. The first
site will be given the aliases ftp.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org and
ftp1.&lt;country&gt;.debian.org. Future sites will simply be given an alias
of the second type with the number incremented appropriately.</p>
