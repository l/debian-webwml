<toc-add-entry name="whether">Whether to mirror</toc-add-entry>

<p>While we appreciate all new mirrors, every prospective mirror maintainer
should make sure that they can answer these questions before trying to
start their own mirror:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is a mirror necessary at my location? Maybe there are already
      mirrors nearby.</li>
  <li>Do I have the resources to host a mirror? Mirrors take up considerable
      disk space and bandwidth, one has to be able to commit to the cost.</li>
  <li>Is a mirror the right choice? Sometimes people mistakenly start
      a mirror, when they actually want to run a caching proxy.</li>
# such as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-proxy">apt-proxy</a>
# not sure if we want to plug just apt-proxy as soon as this -joy, 2007-11-08
</ul>

<toc-add-entry name="what">What to mirror</toc-add-entry>

<p>The <a href="./">main mirror page</a> lists the archives available for
mirroring.</p>

<ul>
<li>
Users will look for the debian/ archive to install Debian over
the network, to build CDs from (with jigdo), and to upgrade already
installed systems.</li>

<li>
debian-cd/ is an archive that isn't identical across all the different
mirror servers. On some sites it contains jigdo templates to build CD images
from (used in combination with files from debian/), on some it contains
already built CD images, and on some sites both.
<br />
Please see the page for <a href="$(HOME)/CD/mirroring/">mirroring the CD
images</a> for further information on this.</li>

<li>
debian-archive/ contains the true <em>archive</em>, the old and obsolete
versions of Debian. It will generally be interesting only to a small segment
of users.</li>

</ul>

<p>Please see <a href="size">the mirror size</a> page for
more precise information about mirror sizes.</p>

<p>The debian-security/ archives contain the security updates released by
the Debian security team. It sounds interesting to everyone, but since the
security updates are sporadic, one would have to mirror it very often to be
up to date (or use <a href="push_mirroring">push mirroring</a>) so we do not
recommend it. Debian makes every effort to maintain the high availability of
security.debian.org instead.</p>

<p>NB: the debian-non-US/ archive is deprecated since the 3.1
(<em>sarge</em>) release in June 2005.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="wherefrom">Where to mirror from</toc-add-entry>

<p>Many people seem to think that <code>ftp.debian.org</code> is the
canonical location of Debian packages and that it will be best for them
to mirror from that site. This is <strong>not true</strong>.</p>

<p><code>ftp.debian.org</code> is merely one of several servers that get
updated from an internal Debian server. That address is presently located
on a single server in the United States, and it still exists mainly for
backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The <a href="official">official mirrors</a> are meant to be a good place
to mirror from. Any of the servers in the <a href="list-full">full list of
mirrors</a> that have the tags <q><kbd>Type: Push-Primary</kbd></q> or
<q><kbd>Type: Push-Secondary</kbd></q> should be good to mirror from.
Please use one that is close to you both network-wise and geographically.</p>

<p>There is no real difference between different <em>Push-Primary</em>
mirror servers as far as mirroring is concerned. On the other
hand, if many people use ftp.debian.org (and unfortunately, they do), this
needlessly wastes the donated bandwidth.</p>

<p>Mirror administrators in the United States should mirror from
ftp.us.debian.org (the official mirror address from the US, which is a
Push-Primary mirror). But, since that address is also a round-robin alias
for several machines, it usually makes sense to determine which of the
components is the best and then mirror from that particular one.
<br />
<small>The upside of doing that is that it avoids the risk of failures
when performing a two-stage rsync (different stages might end up on
different machines during time windows where they have different data,
causing a race condition). The downside is that it concentrates on
a single site the performance of which may vary, but that is currently
inherent to our mirror network in general.</small></p>

<toc-add-entry name="how">How to mirror</toc-add-entry>

<p>The recommended method of mirroring is with
the so called <a href="anonftpsync">anonftpsync</a> script.</p>

<p>The mirroring protocol which we recommend is
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/rsync">rsync</a>.</p>

<p>Please do not mirror Debian using <kbd>wget</kbd> and other tools
based on FTP. They may seem to work well, but will have numerous
issues (they can't detect hard links, it's harder to make partial
mirrors, etc).</p>

<h3>rsync setup</h3>

<p>We recommend to use <a href="anonftpsync">this script</a> to mirror the archive.
Follow the directions in the script to set up mirroring.</p>

<p>Here is some advice for those who prefer different methods:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Run rsync with at least these options: <kbd>--recursive --times
      --links --hard-links --delete</kbd>.</li>

  <li>Avoid mirroring index files (Packages, Sources, etc) before
      all the new data files (.deb, .orig.tar.gz, etc) are in place.
      Use two stages of rsync - first transfer the data files while
      excluding the index files, and then transfer everything else.
      <br/>
      This can be done by using <kbd>--exclude</kbd> to skip Packages*,
      Sources* and Release* files, or by using only the pool/ subdirectory
      in the first stage.
      See <a href="anonftpsync">our script</a> for an example.</li>

  <li>If you have extra disk space, also use the <kbd>--delete-after</kbd>
      option to avoid some of the temporary update problems.</li>

  <li>If you don't have enough disk space to mirror everything, use the
      <kbd>--exclude</kbd> option to exclude portions of the archive from
      mirroring. Commonly this includes various architectures you might not
      want; for example, this would exclude <em>all</em> architectures:
      <br />
<: 
print "<code>--exclude binary-$_/ --exclude *_$_.deb --exclude *_$_.udeb --exclude installer-$_/ --exclude Contents-$_*</code><br>\n"
  foreach (sort keys %arches);
:>
      Check the <a href="#partial">section on partial mirroring</a> as well.</li>

  <li>After rsync is done mirroring, add a time stamp file to the
      <code>project/trace/</code> subdirectory of the Debian mirror
      named after your server. This means running
      <kbd>date -u &gt; .../debian/project/trace/<var>your.server</var></kbd>
      after your daily rsync is finished.</li>

  <li>We strongly advise against excluding the <tt>project/</tt>, <tt>doc/</tt>
      and other subdirectories. Usually these are minor in size and yet useful to
      users.
      Especially <tt>project/trace</tt> helps very much if there are any mirror issues.</li>

  <li>Usually the upstream rsync servers will allow anonymous access.
      In case they require authentication, set up usernames and passwords
      in your script, either via the RSYNC_PASSWORD environment variable,
      or using the <kbd>--password-file</kbd> option.</li>
</ul>

<toc-add-entry name="partial">Partial mirroring</toc-add-entry>

<p>Considering the already <a href="size">large size of Debian archive</a>,
some people prefer to mirror only parts of it they need. If you want to
exclude something, you should exclude architectures.</p>

<p>With <a href="anonftpsync">anonftpsync</a>, this can be done by
editing the ARCH_EXCLUDE variable.
There are also other specially written scripts.
However, they are not suited for official mirrors.</p>

<p>We strongly advise against excluding the <tt>project/</tt>, <tt>doc/</tt>
and other subdirectories. Usually these are minor in size and yet useful to
users.
Especially <tt>project/trace</tt> helps very much if there are any mirror issues.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="when">When to mirror</toc-add-entry>

<p>The main archive gets updated twice a day.
The mirrors commonly start updating around 9:00 and 21:00 (both times UTC),
but these are never fixed times and you should not fixate your mirror on them.</p>

<p>We recommend mirroring once every day. Mirroring more often than twice a
day is pointless and will most likely lead to getting you banned &mdash; never do
that.</p>

<p>Your mirror should update a few hours after one of the main archive
mirror pulses.
You should check if the site you're mirroring from leaves a time stamp
file in their <kbd>project/trace/</kbd> subdirectory. The time stamp file
will be named like that site, and it will contain the completion time of
their last mirror update. Add a couple of hours to that time (to be safe)
and mirror then.</p>

<p>The easiest way to automatically have the mirror run every day is to use
cron. See <kbd>man crontab</kbd> for details.</p>

<p>Note that if your site is being triggered with a push mechanism, then you
don't need to worry about any of this.</p>

<h3>Push-triggered mirroring</h3>

<p><q>Push</q> mirroring is a form of mirroring that we have developed
to minimize the time it takes for changes to the archive to reach mirrors.
An upstream mirror uses an SSH trigger to tell the downstream mirror to
update itself. The <q>pushing</q> is usually limited to a secure trigger
that takes no variable data, so the rest of the mirroring process is
simply <q>pull</q> like with a cron job.</p>

<p>Push mirroring is necessary to keep multiple servers in synchronization
(such as servers in DNS round-robin aliases like <tt>ftp.us.debian.org</tt>),
and we commonly use it for our first and second tier mirrors. For <q>normal</q>
mirrors, this method requires a lot of effort to set up which doesn't
actually pay off compared to a well tuned cron job.</p>

<p>For a more detailed description of how this works, why it is secure, and
how to set a push mirror, please see <a href="push_mirroring">the complete
explanation</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="settings">Recommended additional settings</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you are going to make the Debian mirror available through HTTP, please
add the following settings to your Apache configuration (presuming, of
course, you will use Apache), within the
<code>&lt;Directory <var>/path/to/your/debian/mirror</var>&gt;</code>
block, where <var>/path/to/your/debian/mirror</var> should be the actual
name of the directory where you keep the mirror:</p>

<pre>
   Options +Indexes +SymlinksIfOwnerMatch
   IndexOptions NameWidth=* +SuppressDescription
</pre>

<p>This enables the directory indices and makes sure and that following
symlinks will work. The file names in the directory indices won't be truncated,
and (mostly nonexistent) descriptions won't be shown.</p>

<p>In Apache 1.3.x, the following option may also be added:</p>

<pre>
   DirectoryIndex .
</pre>

<p>Do not add that option in Apache 2.x.</p>
