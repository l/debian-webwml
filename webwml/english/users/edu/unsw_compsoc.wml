<p>
  COMPSOC, as a society that represents over five thousand students
  to various bodies, both inside and outside of UNSW, have
  centralised on using Debian on all their hosts. Reasons for this
  include the fact that Debian will run, without tweaking, on a large
  range of hardware - of different architectures, and of differing
  age.  This single fact vastly simplifies administration, and makes
  it easier to centralise many tasks. The quality control and
  package management are also bonuses for us.
