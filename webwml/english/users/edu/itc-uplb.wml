#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on most of our servers, delivering services such as e-mail, 
    chat (XMPP), LDAP, web hosting, etc.  We have about 20 servers on which 
    Debian runs on, some running Lenny, some running Etch.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of the reliability and freedom it offers us to 
    provision any computing services we want.
