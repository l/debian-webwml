<p>
  The Economics Department runs Debian on all its servers (there are
  four main ones), on five workstation-servers that are used by
  graduate students, and on over 20 workstations in almost all
  graduate student offices. It is also used by several faculty
  members, although a few others use Red Hat and most use other
  operating systems.
</p>
<p>
  In large part, we use Debian for historical reasons. When we first
  started to use Linux, our local expert was a visiting graduate
  student who was (and is) a Debian developer. We continue to use it
  primarily because of the ease of upgrading and the efforts of the
  Debian security team.
