    Our cluster includes over 30 worker nodes and several servers 
    (<url http://rostlab.org/ganglia>).

    We chose Debian 'stable' because of its low maintenance need due to it being 
    unchanging for the long lifetime of stable releases. Also, we find the way 
    the distribution is build (configuration files, packaging policy) very 
    convenient and well-thought-out.  Thank you for the great distribution.
