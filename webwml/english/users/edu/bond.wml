#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Bond University's IT School uses Debian as a platform to teach
students various technical subjects (e.g. Unix system administration,
computer security, modular programming and others), and most of
our research and development infrastructure is Debian-based.
We have benefited greatly from the stability, security and upgrade
capabilities of Debian over the last ten years and are convinced
that Debian is the best Linux distribution for maintaining servers.

<p>
The number of workstations and servers differs every semester: about
20-40 physical workstations, about the same in virtual workstations,
15-30 servers running just about anything under the sun.
