    We are a university in partnership with the Robertson College in Canada, 
    which delivers degrees to our students who take their exams here.  Most of 
    the content from their training is done on Windows and Cisco.  As the 
    supervisor of the Linux part of this training, which is not considered by 
    the Canadians, I decided to set up three servers, two running Debian and 
    one running Ubuntu, for our lab work. We have configured usual network 
    services such as DNS, DHCP, Apache, MySQL, SAMBA, Nagios…  Additionally, we 
    have three computer science rooms, each having at least 20 machines with 
    Windows/Debian dual boots.
