<p>
    Debian has been the official Linux distribution of the Department for at 
    least 10 years.  For a few years we were the official Chilean mirror of the 
    distribution.  The department computer lab are using Debian, and the 
    computer classes are based on the Debian distribution.  The computers in
    the administrative office of the Department are using Debian.  Many of the
    professors have Debian on their computers.  Many of our computer clusters 
    are also using Debian.
