#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We are using Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 on 5 of our servers.  These
  servers are for the Internet connection, firewalling, masquerading
  and web/mail/FTP/DNS services. We use the Apache webserver, the
  BIND9 nameserver, iptables, the Squid proxy cache, Postfix
  mailserver, qpopper, proftpd ftp daemon and a couple of other
  little tools and programs.
</p>
<p>
  We've chosen Debian, because one admin (me) and some of the other
  admins have tested Debian successfully at home and wanted to
  reinstall the servers.
