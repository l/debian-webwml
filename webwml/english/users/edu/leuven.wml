#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian as one of 3 standard platforms (the others being Sun
  Solaris and HP Tru64) for members of the department
  and it is the only standard platform for our student labs.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we maintain more than 200 Debian workstations (user desktop 
  machines) and more than 20
  Debian servers (samba, database, web, print ...) in a
  semi-automatic way: all are kept up to date based
  on a few master machines. The masters are installed and configured
  manually, but distribute their state (installed packages and 
  configuration) every night automatically to the others.
</p>
<p>
  We have been doing this with Debian
  since 1997.  The reason for choosing Debian over other Linux
  distributions are obvious : ease of package administration, smooth
  upgrades, installs, ... other distributions might offer other
  software packages, but none offer the same degree of quality ...
  if it's available in Debian, it just works.
