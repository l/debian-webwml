#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian as one of 4 standard platforms (the others being Sun
  Solaris, HP-UX and Compaq Tru-64) for members of the department
  and it is the only standard platform for our student labs.
</p>
<p>
  Currently we maintain about 150 Debian workstations and a handful
  of Debian servers (samba, database, web, print ...) in a
  semi-automatic way: all are kept up to date automatically, based
  on a few master machines and we have been doing this with Debian
  since 1997.  The reason for choosing Debian over other Linux
  distributions are obvious : ease of package administration, smooth
  upgrades, installs, ... other distributions might offer other
  software packages, but none offer the same degree of quality ...
  if it's available in Debian, it just works.
