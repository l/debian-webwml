#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  All but one of the ten machines in the lab are running Debian the other 
  runs Red Hat 6.0. Two are running Sarge and the rest Woody. Three of them 
  are laptops. We use Debian for every day work (internet, office tasks, 
  programming, etc.) and we are also running an Openmosix cluster (laptops 
  included) to run our simulations.
