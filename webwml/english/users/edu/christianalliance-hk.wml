#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    At CAIS we use Debian on our two main servers which provide for the 
    school's needs in terms of file and application services, mail and web 
    servers. We also teach students to install and configure their own Debian 
    systems for both desktop and basic server use. We have thirty five computers 
    installed with Debian.

<p>
    The school puts an emphasis on open source software and encourages students 
    to use open source software both at school and at home.
