#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We currently have three servers that are running Debian, and the only 
    non-Debian OS used is an OpenBSD. Some of the packages we use are:
    openldap+bdb, samba, postfix, mailman, courier-[imap,pop3], squirrelmail,
    amavis-new, clamav, syslog-ng, bind9, freeradius, mysql, apache2, vsftpd.
</p>

<p>
    Our decision to use Debian is based on its package management system
    (APT), ease of maintenance, security patches and stability.
