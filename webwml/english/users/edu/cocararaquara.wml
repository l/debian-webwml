<p>
  We decided to use Debian after testing various distributions, but
  we really decided when a Debian developer showed us the real
  GNU/Linux. Thanks to pzn@debian.org.

<p>
  We use Debian Woody (kernel 2.4.18) to "hold" our link to
  Internet, using radio frequency, pcmcia modules and so on. We use
  IPTables and Squid to share the connection with the internal
  network. All in only one server.  Other schools use the same
  solution.  Live long and prosper, Debian.
