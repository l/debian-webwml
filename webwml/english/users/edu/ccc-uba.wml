#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are UBA's NOC.  We use the stable brach of Debian GNU/Linux on a few 
    workstations and on almost all of our servers.  We also have a Debian
    mirror.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because it is stable, simple and fast to install and to
    use, and because it is Free Software.
