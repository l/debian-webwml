<p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux to run a server for the department, with 
    internal web pages and shared FTP/Samba home directories.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Linux to grant multiuser and desk-independent access to the users, 
    easier configurability and updating, and a totally cost-free solution, and 
    in particular Debian for the extreme stability and availability.
