<p>
    We use Debian on 9 production servers and around 15 development/integration 
    servers. The IT department of IAESTE Czech Republic is responsible for 
    maintenance and development of organization-specific intranet solutions, 
    e-mail and file sharing services. There are about 150 active intranet 
    accounts used by volunteers and employees of IAESTE CR. We also host around 
    40 public websites/microsites dedicated to various projects of IAESTE CR and 
    associated organizations.

<p>
    Debian was chosen for universality, ease of maintenance, stability and good 
    community support.
