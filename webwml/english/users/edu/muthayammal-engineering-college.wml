#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    In our department, Debian is used on 4 systems and it provides a wonderful 
    support to the students for their projects. We use the following servers:
    NFS, DNS, ftp. Debian is also used for surfing the net.

<p>
    Easy upgrades and security are the added advantages.
