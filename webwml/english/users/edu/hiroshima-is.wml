#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Our school runs Debian-Edu / Skolelinux.  A central server houses the user 
    accounts of all members of the school.  We have several thin-client servers 
    facilitating the re-use of older hardware.  Then there are regular 
    workstation installs, including on a class set of netbooks. In total we have 
    one computer for every two students, and one for every staff member. 90 
    percent of these computers are running Debian-Edu.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian-Edu for its pre-configuration of all services, and focus on 
    software for schools.  Debian allows us to spend our IT budget on hardware 
    alone.
