#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on 42 computers for thesis consultation, databases, web 
    browsing and courses for students and teachers. The main applications
    in use are Iceweasel, Chromium, Ted, Zotero, VLC, Xournal, Audacity, GIMP 
    and Inkscape. Furthermore, we use Debian on one computer for scanning 
    materials with Xsane, SimpleScan and as a print server with CUPS.  Also, 
    one of our members uses Debian as his main operating system for 
    everything in the daily use (LibreOffice, Iceweasel, Icedove, Liferea).

<p>
    We chose Debian over other GNU/Linux distributions because of its sense of 
    community, principles, development way, stabilty and always nice work in the 
    maintenance and security of all included software.

<p>
    Thank you for making Debian the best GNU/Linux distribution, in all 
    meanings.
