    Our courses are designed and directly linked to the needs of the
    corporate clients ensuring our students receive the right industry
    training and education. In GNU/Linux we have selected Debian for it's
    stability and strict adherence to GNU/Linux and Debian is known for
    relatively strict adherence to the Unix and free software philosophies
    and as well as using collaborative software development and testing
    processes. In lab-3 we run one permanent Debian server and eight other
    systems for the students to practice Debian.
