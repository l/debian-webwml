#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We are an animation and information center for young people, we
  have set up a computer room for everyone use.  We have our own email
  server, we offer in addition to Internet connectivity, web hosting
  for all our users and we also do basic Linux training for everyone
  who wants to join.
</p>
<p>
  Our computer room has 8 computers running Debian woody and 2 more
  which are destined to perform administrative tasks as
  firewalling, proxying, NIS, NFS, DHCP, printing, databases, DNS,
  email, and web serving.
</p>
<p>
  When I was told to set this computer room, I had my ideas clear about
  it, as a Debian user, I believe it is one of the distributions which follow
  the Linux spirit, besides offering a lot of packaged software.
  The other distributions I've tried always have been disorganized and a
  headache, it's painful for users like me to find the things in their
  right place, I've always avoided the use of graphical tools to set the
  optimal configurations, besides the annoying updating system which are
  almost automatic in Debian, then the choice was clear to me.
