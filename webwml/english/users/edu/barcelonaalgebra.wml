<p>
  We are using Debian GNU/Linux to run a little server for the
  department, with internal web pages and shared home
  directories. The services are to be competitive with the
  university's own server, which runs a text-only HP-UX without any
  of the modern instruments and applications (no TeX, old (2.0)
  navigator, poor termcap support, very poor technical support, no
  modern shell), so we decided to run our own server. Also the
  server controls the two departmental printers, serving a lpd and a
  cups queue.

<p>
  We choose Linux to grant multiuser and desk-independent access to
  the users, easier configurability and updating, and totally
  cost-free solution, and in particular Debian for the extreme
  stability and availability. Moreover, our cousin department is
  serving a stable ftp distribution, so it was also a matter of
  bandwidth.
