#use wml::debian::users

<p>We maintain 2 servers which use apache2, dokuwiki, owncloud, and gitolite.</p>
<p>We also maintain 6 workstations, a couple of laptops and a custom 24-core 
machine which we use for development and experiments. These machines run 
various compilers such as GCC, Intel, and Oracle Suncc, debuggers/analyzers 
such as Intel vtune and development-related tools such as autotools, flex, 
and bison.</p>
<p>All are Debian-based for stability first (we always use STABLE) and 
for uniform administration. Debian was chosen because of stability and timely 
security updates.</p>
