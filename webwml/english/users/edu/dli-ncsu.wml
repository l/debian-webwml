#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on several desktops and laptops as well as on the central data 
    server we use to manipulate geospatial data prior to ingest into the DSpace 
    digital repository.  This instance of Debian provides everyone on our 
    project access to data via Samba without fear of virus and malware issues.  
    It also does most of the project data crunching.

<p>
    I chose Debian for its stability, security, documentation, and superb
    package support.
