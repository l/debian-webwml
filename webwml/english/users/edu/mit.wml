#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  In the MIT AI lab the <q>Officially Supported</q> flavor of GNU/Linux
  is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
  Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
  compute cycles.
</p>
<p>
  The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
  reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
  here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
  semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
  system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
  problems).
