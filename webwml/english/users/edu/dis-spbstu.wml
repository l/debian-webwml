#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian since 2008; it is a primary Linux system for us.  At the 
    moment Debian GNU/Linux is running on four servers and five office 
    workstations, whose work is critical.  Debian is also used in laboratories
    for research and educational projects. Thanks a lot, Debian!
