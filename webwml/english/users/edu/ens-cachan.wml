<p>
    The Debian distribution is the largest distribution used in this 
    university-like school, including more than 20 laboratories.  The best and 
    the original use of Debian is the network one: routers (under ATM and 
    Gigabit Ethernet technologies, with dynamic routing inside and outside 
    campus), firewall (stateful filtering on each router), VPN gateway (based 
    on the OpenVPN project).  Debian is also used in all DSI (Direction of 
    Information Systems) Linux servers, databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle), 
    network services (DNS, proxy, LDAP, news, etc.) and workstations in free 
    access rooms.  Finally, all current Debian distributions have been installed 
    on the meso-calculator (Nec TX7 with 32 Itanium2 processors) without 
    touching to the original and only supported distribution from Red Hat.

    Also, for years the ENS-Cachan has hosted an official FTP mirror of the 
    Debian distribution.  The students organize Debian install parties.

<p>
    The choice of the Debian distribution is historical (the most used Linux 
    distribution amongst the system administrators), philosophical (independence 
    from commercial contraints), and pragmatical (Debian is easier to 
    administrate than to install ;-) ).
