<p>
  Before Debian was adopted, the Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) used
  several different Linux distributions: one for servers, another for
  touchscreens, another for itaniums, another for desktops, etc, and the
  use of Linux was not widespread.  Each of these other distributions
  were capable in their niche, but had limitations which did not allow
  them to be used in other capacities.  As the use of Linux at the GSC
  grew, it became burdensome to maintain all these different
  distributions.  We decided to standardize on Debian GNU/Linux, since
  it is the only distribution that gives of the power and flexibility we
  need to cover all these different machine requirements.

<p>
  Debian GNU/Linux was first deployed at the GSC as a desktop
  workstation operating system and now is running on roughly 50
  workstations.  More importantly, our whole data tracking system is run
  on about 80 Debian GNU/Linux machines with touchscreen monitors and
  barcode scan guns.  Once Debian proved its mettle on the desktop and
  data tracking arenas, it was used when we replaced our web servers,
  ftp server, and mail server, greatly reducing the total cost of
  replacement.
