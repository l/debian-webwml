#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We are running 200 Linux PCs distributed all around the university (number 
  constantly growing!), a Linux computer cluster, two student pools and 
  several servers with Debian woody. Apart from the servers, all computers 
  are integrated in the NIS+ domain and get their home-directories via NFS 
  from a central SUN E450. They get updated via apt-get whereby all packages 
  are adapted to the local circumstances beforehand, so that the users in the 
  faculties do not have to do any system administration. The most important 
  data of the clients are stored in a central MySQL database, which is 
  connected during the installation and everyday administrative processes.

  Debian was mainly chosen for its ease of administration and software 
  updates. Its well-tested release policy reduces the amount of updates and 
  guarantees stability. Furthermore lots of free documentation is available 
  which allows insights into the technical details of the system.
