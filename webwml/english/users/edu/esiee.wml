  ESIEE has been introducing Linux for the past few years in its IT
  infrastructure, on several levels.
</p>
<p>
  The first part is the migration from HP/UX workstation used for
  application-specific tasks - such as electronic design tools and
  mathematics software - to standardized PCs running Linux. At the
  moment, 75% of the workstations have been replaced. The last 25%
  will be replaced once the electronic CAD software vendors will
  have ported their applications to Linux.
</p>
<p>
  The second part is the introduction of Debian as a dual-boot
  system on the students-accessible computers. The goal of the
  introduction of Linux is to bring more flexibility for the
  planning of lessons, as Linux can replace both HP/UX workstations
  for scientific tasks and Windows computers for Internet access and
  office work.  The third part is the migration of servers from
  HP/UX, Banyan Vines and Windows NT to Debian-based Linux
  systems. The switch was accelerated when it was decided to replace
  the aging Banyan solution with an LDAP/Samba account system on the
  Windows computers that are accessible to the students and the
  staff of the school.  The long term objective is to replace as
  much Windows computers as possible, even for the administrative
  personnel.
</p>
<p>
  Debian was chosen for its ease of administration and installation
  through the use of .debs and FAI, allowing installation of labs of
  12 computers within 20 minutes without the need for a CD or a
  floppy and without any user interaction. The creation of packages
  from vendor binaries enables an easy, consistent and fast way for
  installing the same software across around 200 computers used for
  scientific tasks.
