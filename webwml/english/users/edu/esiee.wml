ESIEE Paris incorporates 2 centres for higher education, founded and run
by the <a href="http://www.esiee-paris.fr/en/institution/ccip.php">\
CCIP</a> as part of its educational commitments.

They provide high-level courses for engineers planning careers in
information or communication science and technology, and for executives
wishing to pursue management positions in top-end high-tech companies.

ESIEE Paris opens the door to a variety of professional careers in the fields
of computer science, electronics, telecommunications and embedded systems.

  ESIEE has been introducing Linux for the past few years in its IT
  infrastructure, on several levels.

Historically, the main reason was the migration from HP/UX workstation used for
application-specific tasks — such as electronic design tools and
mathematics software — to standardized PCs running Linux.

But ESIEE Paris is still using Debian on Workstations and servers.

More than 500 workstations are working under Debian as a dual-boot
system on the students-accessible computers.

Many of computer-aided design softwares are running under Debian.

On the other hand, ESIEE Paris uses Debian on about 20 servers
to provide different IT services for the school such as LDAP,
Samba, web servers (Apache and Tomcat), databases, etc.

<p>
  Debian was chosen for its ease of administration and installation
  through the use of packages and FAI, allowing installation of labs of
  12 computers within 20 minutes.

Stability, scalability, existence of many packages and easy administration
are the principal reasons of our choice and why we continue to trust Debian.
