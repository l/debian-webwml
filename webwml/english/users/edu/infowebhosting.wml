#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have been using Debian on our primary Linux server for more than two 
    years now, and we are really happy about the performance and the security 
    that Debian provide us every day.
</p>

<p>
    We mainly use Debian for our firewall, our DNS, DHCP servers, and also for 
    our mail hub.
