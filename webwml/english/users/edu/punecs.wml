<p>
  We adopted Debian after scanning all the distros available grading them
  with max. weightage on "Programming Convenience" and "maintainability".
  Debian "outperformed" all other distros with a great margin.
</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    Programming Convenience: With its abundant packages and its clever
    interface (apt) it's pretty easy to install a library or search for one.
    90% of chances you'll get in the repository. Moreover all the cleverer
    tools of Programming (IDE, libraries, modules, modes etc.) you'll get
    in the repository and moreso just an <em>apt-get install &lt;package-name&gt;</em>
    does it all for you, you are back to coding.
	</li>
  <li>
    Maintenance: Debian rocks at Package Management. No distro gets
    even closer to this. We've had nightmares going thru the "rpm"
    dependencies earlier.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  All our server/client machines in the Department run on Debian.
