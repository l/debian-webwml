<p>
  Debian GNU/Linux is used in 90% of the hosts in the
  Department. The users are Computer Science graduate and
  undergraduate students, researchers and the University staff.
</p>
<p>
  We have almost 200 hosts, 150 being X-terminals diskless (486,
  pentium, pentium-II, K6 and K6II). These X-terminals are connected
  to 8-10 modern servers (Athlon 1.4GHz). There are 2-4 NFS servers,
  WWW-servers, Mail-servers.
