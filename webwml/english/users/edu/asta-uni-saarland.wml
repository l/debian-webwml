#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    All our servers are powered by Debian, including web server, file server, 
    authentication server, mail server, backup server, etc.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian over other distributions because of its stability, security 
    support, package management system, and of course its huge repositories.
