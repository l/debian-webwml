<p>
  Debian is used for some of the servers (WEB, Cricket, Snort,
  Arpwatch, MySQL, ...) while SUN Servers are used as file servers
  and mail servers.  The Mail servers will be changed to Debian
  systems soon.  Distributed computing is done on 5 dual processor
  PCs running Debian. There are plans to set up a cluster for
  distributed computing running Debian.

<p>
  About 50 PCs running Debian are used as public Student
  Workstations.  About 30 PCs running Debian are used as private
  Workstations for the Staff.
