#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Our sites IT infrastructure is based on Debian GNU/Linux.
Debian is used for almost all of the servers at our site.
This includes web servers, mail servers, file
servers, print servers and other services.
</p>
<p>
Also the majority of our desktop systems are running Debian.
That includes about 30 PCs used as public workstations for
students, and about 40 PCs as workstations for our staff.
</p>
<p>
The ease of use and its maintainability as well as its
stability makes Debian GNU/Linux our first choice.
