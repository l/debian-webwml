<p>
    We are using Debian Lenny GNU/Linux (stable) since July 2009.  We are using 
    Debian on one machine that's a web server, it runs the following
    applications: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, PHP, and others.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because it is Free Software, stable, strong, and secure. 
    Debian is cool...
