    The system is used as e-mail, file, and ftp server for the laboratory.  It 
    is also used as the course management system (moodle) for the courses 
    offered by the professors in the laboratory.  The server also provides a 
    good programming environment for students to write programs on information 
    security.  The package GMP is used extensively for the projects, and TeX is 
    used to process almost all papers and reports.
