#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian in an IBM rs6000 B50 server. It started solely as a 
  project, but it fired up a whole community of Debian users, we actually 
  use this server for hosting student projects. We choose Debian because we 
  had these choices: SuSE, YellowDog or Debian and I think there is no more 
  I can tell...
