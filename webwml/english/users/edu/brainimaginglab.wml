<p>
  We run a handful of workstations on a slightly customized woody (e.g. 
  2.4.20-openMosix-kernel). These machines mainly do very I/O- and 
  CPU-intensive image-processing using SPM and Matlab. Another server does FTP 
  and SSH-accounting, as well as serving as NFS-repository.

  We chose Debian because we were in need of a really stable base for our 
  research where even a small project takes an enormous amount of time and 
  nerves, and of course because the ease of updating packages, security issues 
  and the feeling of reliability and concept I got over the years using Debian 
  personally.
