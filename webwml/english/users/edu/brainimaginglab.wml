#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use a Debian-derived distribution (UBUNTU) for our clients as well as
  Sarge on a critical server. On the server-side, Debian is still the best
  choice concerning Linux. We appreciate the reliability of the
  versions chosen, the predictability of software-versions as well as the
  fact that critical updates and fixes are available on the spot.
