<p>
  There are 34 machines running Debian (woody). Students, using these 
  machines, are granted a 50 Mb harddisk space, and can use ordinary
  office software (OpenOffice, Lyx and so on); on the machines there are
  installed programs for numeric calculus (such as Matlab), too. This lab is
  completely dedicated to Linux; in the campus many other laboratories are 
  equipped with Linux, but on multi-boot computers.

<p>
  Debian has been selected for stability and for being a system which 
  allows simple upgrading.
