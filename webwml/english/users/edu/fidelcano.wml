#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian on every computer of our institution; we have 22
  computers used by our students, 3 more assigned to teachers, 3
  supporting administrative staff and 1 24/7 Internet connected 
  server.  We support the grading and accounting process using
  software that is being developed at
  <url "http://structio.sourceforge.net/"> in addition to the
  thousands of programs offered by the distribution.
</p>
<p>
  These resources are used by all the academic community, children
  from 6 and teachers up to 60 experience the system.  Our internal
  DNS, NIS/NFS rings, wireless operation, CVS, HTTP, FTP, Dict,
  chat, email, routing schemes services are supported also by Debian.
</p>
<p>
  We are using Debian exclusively since 2001.  Its numerous packages,
  ease of administration, wide documentation, and friendly community
  vindicated our choice.  We have a more comprehensive description
  in Spanish at <url "http://www.gfc.edu.co/si/linux/">
</p>
<p>
  Our students are also learning and installing at their homes and
  their parents are on the way, too. They are also exploring, learning, 
  creating, promoting and sharing with others their knowledge, and also 
  helping some non-profit organizations in our city.
