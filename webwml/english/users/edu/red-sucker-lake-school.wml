    The school has 75 workstations (20 more on the way), most running Debian 
    GNU/Linux Squeeze.  The school has two productions servers running Lenny. 
    One is a GNU/Linux terminal server for the computer lab and the other is a
    NTP/file/database/apt-cacher-ng/DNS/DHCP/HTTP server.  The students install
    Debian Squeeze on a variety of machines for learning to set up desktops and
    servers.  They use netinstalls and now have a preseed.cfg for automatic
    installations by PXE. Students and parents bring machines in to have Debian
    GNU/Linux installed.

    We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of the huge repository and the APT
    packaging system which lighten our load immensely.  A year ago we were
    running XP but had endless malware problems even with multiple firewalls and
    anti-virus scanning-on-access.  Students and staff appreciate the 
    performance of Debian GNU/Linux even on old PCs. The parallel booting 
    process is amazing.  The extreme flexibility of Debian GNU/Linux is the 
    perfect answer to most of our problems with IT.  It allows us to get the 
    best performance from our hardware. Thanks, Debian.
