<p>
    We have one server (Pentium III 500mhz, 128MB) running Debian Sarge; we use 
    it as intranet web server (apache/mysql/php), ticket server (OTRS) and for 
    schedulated mail backup/analys/removal (using software programmed by 
    ourselves). We chose Debian for stability, lightness, maintenance simplicity 
    and for it is cost-free.
