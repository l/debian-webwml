#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian for a wide variety of servers, including 8 print
  servers, a SMB file server, 4 AFS servers, as well as a number of
  web, ftp, and dhcp servers.  We also have two 16 node clusters
  running on Debian, and over 60 public workstations.
</p>
<p>
  In short, why do we use Debian?  apt-get and security.debian.org!
