#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Debian is our primary platform on server site and supported
desktop system for end users (20,000 students and staff).
We run 200 Debian servers for various services: 10 AFS servers
(40,000 volumes), university-wide email and calendar services
(SOGo), Xen virtualisation, 200 virtual web servers, database
servers (Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL), terminal servers, etc.
We directly support 500 user stations with dual
boot (Windows and Debian) in public laboratories.

<p>
We use Debian for its stability and functional package system.
