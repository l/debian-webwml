#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We at Thiagarajar College of Engineering, Madurai, have a 32 node cluster
for the Hadoop MapReduce Framework running on Debian. All our servers in
Data Center including our web server, LDAP server, mail server, database
server, firewall, proxy server and DNS servers run on Debian. Debian is so
widely used in our college that we have a separate intranet repository
containing disc images and packages for various versions of Debian. We are
also actively migrating Windows and Macintosh based machines to run
Debian. We found Debian to be much more stable and secure.
</p>
<p>
Practical sessions and laboratories on C Programming, System Software
and Network Programming are conducted with the help of Debian
machines. Users can logon to their accounts from any machine in
college and use samba based shares provided to them. Demo stalls on
Debian are organized on Software Freedom day every year. This has
encouraged students to use Debian when working on their projects.
</p>
<p>
The number of client workstations that houses Debian would be around 110
in the Central Computing Center and another 100 computers in various labs
in Computer Science Department.
</p>
<p>
Debian has enabled us to automate several System Administration tasks.
Several cron jobs and shell scripts are currently being used. iptables
is very useful in Network Management activities.
