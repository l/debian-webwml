#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Our college uses Debian in the six HP Blade30p, two ML350, and in one TB 
    NAS box. We are running Kerberos, OpenLDAP, Samba, Exim, Cyrus, 
    SquirrelMail, Mailman, PostgreSQL, Bind, Apache, Squid, VsFTPd, sshd in 
    these servers. Apart from these we use Debian in three other lower-end HP 
    servers [NIS, NFS]. The number of client workstations that houses Debian 
    would be around 110 in the Central Computing Center and another 35 computers 
    in the Parallel Processing Lab of the Computer Science Department.

<p>
    The reason for using Debian is due to its stable packages. It is also easy
    to maintain and upgrade.
