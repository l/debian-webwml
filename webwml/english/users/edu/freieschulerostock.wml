<p>
  Debian is more stable than other Linux distributions.  Debian provides
  easy migration from older to newer versions using the simple dselect tool,
  after having edited the apt-get list. We have one server since 3 years 
  to manage the DSL Internet link and to provide squid for Windows NT 
  authorization.
