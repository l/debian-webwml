#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have an 18 computer Sparc Ultra 5 room, an Enterprise 450
  acting as a server for more than 1000 users, a Sparc Ultra 10 that
  holds our web site, mail lists, course web pages and
  administrative tasks.  Debian is being used since June 2001 on
  those machines, and we are able to easily administer our systems,
  and many new programs.  Our students use many tools from those
  that come with Debian.
