  We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
  developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
  was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
  easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
  underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
  Debian.

  Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
  policies. These are two important points in an educational
  environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
  Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
  of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
  then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
  choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a
  means to bring people to change their mind about free software and
  software development in general.

  The INSIA has about 300 students this year (i.e. on September, 2002). We have 
  150 brand new Intel-based workstations, running Debian/stable + some 
  self-packaged pieces of software such as XFree86, which we need because i845 
  video chipset are not supported in XF4.1. We also have 10 servers running 
  various services, such as Apache web server, Postfix mail server, etc...
