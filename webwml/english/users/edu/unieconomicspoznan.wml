<p>
  The server room has four Debian servers. The servers run SMTP software
  (postfix / qmail), database software (mysql), DNS (bind9), HTTP (apache), 
  FTP (proftpd), also things like: MUD game server and music streams.
  We are planning on setting up a laboratory for the students with Debian
  workstations.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian mainly because of the ease of updates and installing new
  packages and because Debian has so much software to choose from and the
  lists are easily extensible.
