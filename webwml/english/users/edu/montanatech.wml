#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  At the CS Department of Montana Tech, we run Debian 3.0 on our two main
  department servers (one's the nfs server, the other's the main server
  people use for interactive off-campus logins), and on 11 other hosts
  set up as a general-purpose lab used by roughly 60 students of three of
  our courses.
</p>
<p>
  We have no assigned systems administrator, so it was very important that
  our systems run with a minimum of fuss, day in and day out.  Debian 3.0
  has lived up to this challenge:  the students use our servers for
  networking assignments, C and C++ programming, and the systems have
  been trouble-free.
</p>
<p>
  Debian's package system (we usually just access it via dselect) is
  a big win.  Security updates are hassle-free, and our systems meet
  our current needs quite comfortably.  I've used a variety of
  commercial Unixes, and Debian's packaging system and reliability
  beats them all, hands-down.  (For what it's worth, I've been a
  full-time systems administrator in both academic and industry
  settings, so my experience with commercial systems has been both
  prolonged and painful...)
