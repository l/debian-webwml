<p>
  Within Bioinformatics, all the machines, both servers and
  workstations have been standardized on using Debian. This is
  generally because of the high levels of support available from
  Debian, and the simplified administration that the Debian package
  management system provides.  Lesser, but still strong reasons are
  the care and quality checking that most maintainers put in their
  packages.
