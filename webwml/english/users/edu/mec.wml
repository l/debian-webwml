#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  All the client and server systems in our computer department's various
  computer labs run Debian GNU/Linux. We have 60 workstations, 5 servers, 
  and 20 Remote Boot thin clients. We've been using Debian for the past two 
  years. It is of course the most stable OS we ever had.
</p>
<p>
  Our servers run software such as apache, proftpd, wu-imap, exim,
  squirrelmail, squid, bind, sshd  and a lot more. All our workstations 
  use icewm, kde or gnome.
