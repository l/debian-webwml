#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have around 100 Debian based physical servers and Virtual Machines 
    running on Xen using Ganeti cluster manager, Bcfg2 configuration management 
    system and agile/CI deployment methodologies.  The services range from Web 
    Content Management Systems for UK Higher/Further Education Institutions and 
    bodies, to a large UK Academic Survey Tool, to JISC funded research and 
    development projects such as semantic web and mobile web technologies.
</p>

<p>
    We use Debian because it's reliable and stable over long service life cycles 
    whilst allowing us to rapidly deploy Open Source Software based environments.
