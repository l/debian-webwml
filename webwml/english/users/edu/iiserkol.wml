<p>
    The Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata has 
    deployed Debian GNU/Linux on about 20 Intel Dual Core HCL workstations
    and 20 Intel Core2Duo Dell workstations. As of November 2008, most of
    them are running Debian "etch", while a few are running Debian testing 
    "lenny". The machines are used for scientific research, programming 
    and code compilation as well as for web browsing and Internet 
    access/e-mail. Debian "etch" runs on our Mail Server (Sendmail 
    + SpamAssassin + ClamAV + Apache + SquirrelMail + Courier Imapd), NFS 
    and NIS server and the network firewall (iptables). Apart from that, 
    Debian GNU/Linux also runs on the personal computers and laptops of 
    some faculty members and students.

<p>
    The main reasons for choosing Debian GNU/Linux:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Debian's stability, security and reliability.</li>
    <li>Availability of a huge number of pre-packaged software.</li>
    <li>Proactive sysadmin and some local users.</li>
</ul>
