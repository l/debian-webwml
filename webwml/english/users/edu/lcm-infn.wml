    In the laboratory we have a 31-nodes cluster, built with Debian, all of them 
    in diskless root, 17 HPC (4 of them in an InfiniBand network) and one CUDA 
    workstation. We're using Condor in the main cluster, and Torque and Maui in 
    the HPC cluster, which is dedicated to the simulation of our Theoretical 
    Physics Department.

<p>
    The choice of Debian is due to its stability, security and its simplicity.
    Also we like Debian for the vast choice of packages and support that one
    can need.
