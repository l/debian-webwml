	<p>The University of Aberdeen is among the UK's top research universities, 
	as noted in the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE 2008) - a year long
	independent evaluation of the quality of research undertaken across 
	Britain's universities.</p>

	<p>The Electronics Research Group (ERG) of the School of Engineering part 
	of the College of Physical Sciences at the University of Aberdeen 
	performs research relating to the design, simulation, optimisation, and 
	benchmarking of systems. It functions as one of the School of 
	Engineering's Research Groups.</p>

	<p>The research group operates its own dedicated research network. The 
	testbed supports the work performed in the research laboratories and 
	remote test sites. The prime use of the testbed is to investigate 
	communications systems and identify potential performance problems, 
	suggest appropriate techniques which may improve performance, and to 
	analyse the impact of implementing specific techniques.</p>

	<p>In order to perform this research, the research group runs a number of 
	services including web, mail and DNS on Debian stable servers. We first 
	began to use Debian on our mail and DNS servers in 2011 on sparc64 servers, 
	although we are now almost entirely using amd64. The stability of Debian 
	allows us to spend less time maintaining these supporting services and 
	more time working on our research.</p>

	<p>We have also used Debian stable and Debian testing in testbeds. The 
	ease in which we can deploy a number of machines configured into the 
	topology we need and be able to get to performing the actual research 
	makes Debian perfect for this use. When we use Debian stable we can also 
	know that other researchers will be able to more easily replicate our 
	setup in order to reproduce our research.</p>
