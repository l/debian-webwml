<p>
  Being a private school, the Lycée Molière does not benefit from all the
  State sponsored grants public schools would normally do. Offering to 
  pupils the same quality of teaching as in other schools is therefore
  sometimes a major challenge.
</p>
<p>    
  When it came to provide the common Internet services to the school, the
  GNU/Linux solution became obvious to us. Our network is made of +/- 30 
  Macintosh Imacs (still running MacOS, for the moment at least!) on the 
  workstation side, and of 1 mail server (exim, cyrus-IMAPd and 
  squirrelMail), one web server (apache), one DNS server (bind9), one file 
  server (netatalk) and one proxy server (Squid + squidGuard), on the 
  server side.
</p>
<p>
  As the school is noway in the position to hire a full-time IT admin, all 
  those machines have to be as stable and secure as possible and what other 
  distribution would do that better than Debian?
</p>
