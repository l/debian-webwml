#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Except for one heretic (who uses Slackware) we all use Debian ever since 
  said heretic introduced it to the institute in the mid-1990s (he switched 
  later, God knows why...).  We have 5 servers, 29 workstations, and 3 
  notebooks with Debian.
</p>
<p>
  The software is mostly scientifically relevant stuff like LaTeX, C++, some
  graphic tools like xfig, standard apache and e-mail/internet stuff and
  things that help to scan and burn.
</p>
<p>
  Why we run Debian: Very convenient upgrading mechanism, security issues, 
  rarely need the latest drivers for fancy hardware anyway (so no drawback in 
  using Debian), installation via net (local mirror) straightforward - well, 
  and of course additionally all the standard reasons why Linux over Windows, 
  but that is not Debian specific.
