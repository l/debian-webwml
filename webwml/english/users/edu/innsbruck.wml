#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian on workstation clusters (currently about 30 dual processor
  nodes) running software in the field of theoretical and computational
  chemistry (<a href="http://www.turbomole.com/">TURBOMOLE</a>).  The most 
  important reason why we decided on Debian in 1998 was the ease of package
  management (apt-get).
