#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian for our all Internet servers like mail, web, DNS, fileserver, 
    proxy, DHCP-VLAN server, NOC, mirror, etc. We have 10 servers that use 
    Debian Sarge and 1 Debian Sid. For education purposes we use Debian for PCs 
    in labs. Almost all students use Debian as operating system.
