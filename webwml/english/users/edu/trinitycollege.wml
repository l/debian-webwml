<p>
  Debian was selected for its ease of upgrading and applying security 
  updates, and large selection of packages. We currently maintain several
  Linux labs with workstations running Debian custom installed with FAI.
  We also use Debian on several student maintained Beowulf clusters 
  consisting of a total of 20 Sun Ultra 5s. The primary department file 
  server is also running Debian.

<p>
  The college is current running five servers with Debian and is in the 
  process of replacing most of the remaining Red Hat and Solaris servers with 
  Debian.
