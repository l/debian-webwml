#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have about 160 workstations which are automatically installed with
  additional science/math/astronomical software. We also have about 10
  servers. All machines run stable.
</p>
<p>
  We have chosen Debian because of stability, functionality, level of 
  development, flexibility and adaptability.
