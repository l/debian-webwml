<p>
  We are using Debian on our servers (3 of them) and increasingly on
  workstations (about 15 to date). Debian also powers our cluster of about 40 
  nodes. Our reasons are mainly security and ease of administration, but 
  stability is also an important factor -- and we run testing on most 
  machines without negative experiences. The other main factor is the strong 
  Debian support available everywhere. Thanks, Debian!
