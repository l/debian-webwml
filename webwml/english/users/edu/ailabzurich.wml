#use wml::debian::users

<p>
The Department of Informatics uses almost exclusively open source
software in general and Debian/GNU Linux in particular on their server
infrastructure.

Currently we run Debian on around 20 physical and 40 virtual machines
(KVM). Figures which are constantly growing.
</p>
<p>
Services provided on these machines include DHCP, LDAP, SMTP, IMAP,
webmail, mailing lists, CalDAV, Samba, redundant storage, backup, Subversion and Git
repositories, web proxy, Drupal and Joomla websites, MediaWiki, Tomcat,
PostgreSQL and MySQL, configuration management and inventory.

Migration of DNS on to Debian machines is planned, after which our
central IT services will be entirely Debian-based.
</p>
<p>
The most important reasons to us for using Debian is its stability,
security and upgradeability. Furthermore, we also like its flexibility
when it comes to mixing in packages from testing or unstable to systems
running Debian stable. This enable us to profit both from the stability
of Debian (based on the conservativeness of Debian stable) and to be up
to the state of the art for exactly those packages where it is required.

Additionally, Debian is among the most complete distributions, i.e. most
of the software we need is already packaged for Debian.
