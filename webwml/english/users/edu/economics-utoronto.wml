<p>
    Presently we use Debian on 8 of our 9 Linux servers; the holdout is a legacy 
    installation of another distribution that is no longer maintained but is 
    required for certain software usage. Debian is the distribution of choice 
    because of the timeliness and completeness of updates, the breadth of 
    software available, and the ease of software installation and management. It 
    is often possible to have a Debian machine fully functional in under 20 
    minutes from bare metal using very limited tools.

<p>
    Our Debian-based Linux systems are used for many tasks, some of these are: 
    web servers, file servers, database servers (postgresql and mysql), 64-bit 
    task servers for large scale graduate research project (running R, Stata, 
    Matlab), two peer reviewed journal sites, network backup and install point, 
    and many other uses.
