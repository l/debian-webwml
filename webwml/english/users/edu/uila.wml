  Since 2000, the-One-True-Linux (Debian GNU/Linux) has been the
  facto standard distro for network (web, mail, proxy, printer,
  file) servers at the UILA campus. It is widely used at the
  Computer Service Office (UPT Komputer), the Faculty of Computer
  Science, the Faculty of Science, as well as the Faculty of
  Engineering.  UILA is also proudly hosting mirrors such like
  <a href="http://www.id.debian.org/">http://www.id.debian.org/</a> ; <a href="http://kambing.vLSM.org/">http://kambing.vLSM.org/</a>
  <a href="http://sdn.vLSM.org/">http://sdn.vLSM.org/</a>; and 
  http://gnu.vLSM.org/.

<p>
  We have selected the Debian distro because of its easiness to be
  maintained. Unfortunately, it is not easy to be installed (yet).
  Thus, we still use another distro for the user
  workstations/X11/KDE.
