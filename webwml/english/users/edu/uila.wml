<p>
  Since 2000, the-One-True-Linux (Debian GNU/Linux) has been the
facto standard distribution for servers and routers.
It is widely used at faculty level, such as the Faculty of Computer
  Science, the Faculty of Science, as well as the Faculty of
Engineering.
It is also a standard operating system at university level.
UI is also proudly hosting mirrors of free software at 
<url http://kambing.ui.ac.id/> and <url http://sdn.vlsm.org/>.
</p>
<p>
Around 75 servers are using Debian as operating system.
</p>
<p>
We choose Debian because it has the best package management, high grade
security updates and slim installation for server or any specialized
installation.
It can be customized easily and the neat documentation provided in
/usr/share/doc makes it easy to start configuring a new technology.
