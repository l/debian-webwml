<p>
	Our school is using Debian Linux for a variety of tasks such as: teaching
	undergraduate students geophysical data processing and modelling. Our
	researchers and postgraduate students are using Debian for numerical
	simulation and modelling. Our Debian servers run mission critical file
	storage and printing facilities, form a core of our communication
	infrastructure, web publishing, software development, and network
	administration. We have chosen Debian because of stability, functionality,
	level of development, flexibility and adaptability.
