#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We power our linux workstations, notebooks and servers (a total of
  130 at the moment, growing fast) with a self-made
  autoinstallation of Debian (just converting to woody, we plan to
  publish it when it is ready). Our conf-update package handles the
  initial installation and hardware detection and configuration as
  well as upgrades, all non-interactive. Several servers (e.g.
  mail, a compute server) are also handled this way.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian years ago, because we have the full possibility to
  change everything to our needs and because it is relatively easy
  to do upgrades (security,...). The well tested state of each
  release gives us a reassuring stable base to build our additions
  and upgrades (e.g for new hardware) on.
