#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    I am the lead architect of this private educational institution and am 
    providing training on Linux, mostly Debian and its derivatives.  We have two 
    labs where all of the over 30 systems have been running Debian since 2007.  
    The Debian OS runs the Apache web server for training in PHP and MySQL.  We 
    also have Debian installations on most of the numerous laptops that our 
    students bring here.  Debian is really the best OS for organisations like 
    ours.
