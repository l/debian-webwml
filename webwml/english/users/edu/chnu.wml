#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian in teaching and office work.  We study the proper Debian, and 
    Grass GIS, Quantum Gis, Open Office and other Open Source software.  The 
    number of workstations with Debian Squeeze is ten.
</p>

<p>
    I (Vasyl Cherlinka, sysadmin) chose Debian because I love Debian, and for me 
    there is simply no other alternative.  Thank you for your work in the 
    creation and promotion of Debian.
