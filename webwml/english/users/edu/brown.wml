#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Debian is our primary *nix platform, with over 460 desktops and server
machines on our department network. We also have a small number of
CentOS servers and about 140 Windows desktop machines.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian for several reasons, among them:  easy upgrades, the large
  number of packages, well-thought-out package defaults, and stability.
With a small staff and demanding community, Debian helps us streamline
our support efforts.
