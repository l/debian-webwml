#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Debian is our primary *nix platform, with over 300 desktops and server
  machines on our department network.  Previously a Sun shop, we still
  have some Suns and we also support Red Hat Linux and Windows.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian for several reasons, among them:  easy upgrades, the large
  number of packages, well-thought-out package defaults, and stability.
