#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  So far, we have about 550 machines running Woody, of which just
  over 40 are servers. Most of the Woody boxes are used in our 21
  teaching labs where our undergraduate students undertake their
  coursework. The remaining boxes are scattered around academics and
  system administrators desks.
</p>
<p>
 The GNU compilers, XFree, Mozilla, Emacs, vi, apache, mutt, pine,
 mysql and postgresql are the most used software on the machines.
</p>
<p>
 We chose Debian over other Linux distributions because of its
 administrator friendliness and general security awareness.
