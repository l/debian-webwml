<p>
  Physics and Astronomy runs Debian on the main departmental server. 
  There are workstations and servers throughout the department that run on
  Debian which are used by faculty, staff and grad students.  In the
  science theaters, a lab of twenty+ Debian workstations is open for all
  physics students to use with a central Debian lab server.

<p>
  We find Debian as reliable and as easy to use than the previous SGI Irix
  machines and the Sun Sparc machines.  Some of the Sparc's have been
  converted to Debian OS.  We still do computational work with SGI
  and Sun's but hope in the future to have a Debian cluster up and running
  (funding permitting).
