#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We're using Debian for a laboratory of 20+ dual-boot desktop computers
  for undergraduate and graduate students. We chose Debian for its support
  of a very big diversity of packages (drscheme and support of various
  versions of the gcc compiler, etc.), stability and ease of administration.
