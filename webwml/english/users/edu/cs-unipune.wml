#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have been using Debian for more than ten years.  There are 45 systems in
    the LAB. 40 of them have Debian installed. The following packages are used 
    heavily on the systems: ghc, emacs, vim, gcc, nasm, alloy, python, jdk.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is preferred because of stability, light-weight and the open 
    philosophy.
