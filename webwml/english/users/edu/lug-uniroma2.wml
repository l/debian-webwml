#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We run Debian as main operating system on all our machines.  We have a 
    cluster of more than 10 machines using Xen for virtualization and HTCondor 
    for distributed computing.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian over the competitors because we strongly believe in the 
    impact of collaboration on the overall quality, and because to us, software 
    freedom is one of the most valuable requirements.
