#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on two gateways that connect the school and two other 
    buildings on the campus to the Internet since 2008.  Furthermore, we use 
    some Debian installations in VirtualBox to teach our students basic system 
    administration. They all run Debian Squeeze. On the gateways we run a DHCP 
    and DNS server, Squid and an iptables firewall.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of its stability and ease of maintainability. What 
    is especially nice for us (as we have only limited resources), is the easy 
    upgrade path Debian provides from one release to another, which prevents us 
    from having to reinstall every two years.
