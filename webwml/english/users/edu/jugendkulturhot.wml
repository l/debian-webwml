<p>
    We're using Debian etch on all Internet terminals (4 PCs, etch, Gnome, 
    OpenOffice, Firefox &mdash; kind of Kiosk system) and on our 2 webservers 
    (etch, Apache2, MySQL, PHP5, SSL, IPTABLES). A Fileserver (SAMBA) and 
    the Linux-based firewall (IPTABLES) are running on Debian too.

<p>
    Why Debian? &mdash; It's easy to configure, has the best package support and
    documentation, and it's the most stable system we've ever run. Further  
    it's very simple to update (APT &amp; APTITUDE).  The file structure couldn't 
    be easier to understand and everything feels very compact and organized. 
    Thank you GUYS for that wonderful and awesome system.  90 percent of our 
    kids are using Ubuntu (Debian-based Linux) and they love it...
