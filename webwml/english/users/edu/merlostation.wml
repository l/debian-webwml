#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  At this public school, Debian is used on a small number of
  workstations and a couple servers serving the Debian boxes for
  home directories, DNS, etc.  Debian is used by the students
  primarily for programming and computer graphics classes, extensive
  use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
  boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
  problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
  keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
  desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the
  simplest form possible for the student-run network.  MSNRSTHS is a
  public magnet school in the Beaverton School District.
