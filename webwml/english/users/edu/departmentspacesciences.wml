  Why do we use Debian?  I think Debian is one of the most stable Linux
  distributions available.  And it's so easy to install packages on
  Debian. Anyone can do "apt-get install gtypist". What's so difficult? I
  think, if you don't want pure Debian, you can always try Knoppix.

  We have every PC working on Debian (except one which is on Windows ... I
  really don't know why :) ).  We are basically using Debian in a small
  cluster of eight nodes for running MPI applications using MPICH. Most of
  the things work out of the box.
