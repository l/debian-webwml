#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  GNU/Linux is the default desktop operating system at Harvard EECS.
  Debian is a popular choice, and we are currently working on installing
  it as our default distribution.  Ease of configuration, security updates
  and package management are its primary advantages.  An automated install
  process is in the works; we also locally mirror Debian packages.
