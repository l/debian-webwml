#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Debian currently runs on the main webserver (cthulhu.gdc.wpi.edu -
  Dual Pentium Pro), and the main login server, which handles mail
  as well (lovecraft.gdc.wpi.edu - Alpha DS-10 - currently down due
  to hard drive failure). It is being considered for the three new
  servers that are planned for deployment in the next month.

<p>
  I'm no longer the organization's sysadmin (I graduated) - however,
  I chose Debian for the systems I had control of because of my
  familiarity (using Debian since 0.96R2 - former maintainer of
  apsfilter and abuse), and because of the high security by default
  - as well as the application support, and hardware support for the
  Alpha.
