#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Debian currently runs on our main webserver (lumi.gdc.wpi.edu
— Dual AMD Opteron 4180), which also hosts our game servers.

It is planned to be installed on our other server (poe.gdc.wpi.edu
— Dual AMD Opteron 240) soon when it is retooled to serve new needs
in our organization as Debian has served us extremely well so far.
</p>
<p>
We chose Debian when building our newest server (lumi.gdc.wpi.edu)
due to its ease of setup, its stability, and for the
administrator's familiarity with it as a long-time Debian user.

The excellent APT system, and Debian's security were also
factors in the decision to use Debian on our machines.
