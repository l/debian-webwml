    We are a group working on the origin and the early evolution of life.  Many 
    of our analyses are based on the comparison of protein and genetic 
    sequences.  We find the software that comes with Debian very useful and easy
    to use since we are not specialists in computer matters.  It helps us on 
    five servers and nine workstations used by our undergraduate, masters and
    doctoral students.
