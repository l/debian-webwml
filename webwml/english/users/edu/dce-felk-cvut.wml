<p>
    Debian is used on 20 diskless workstations for education of the subject 
    Computer Systems (mainly for use in control applications) X35POS. The 
    subject has already been taught on Linux for four years.  We use Unionfs 
    and Ingo Molnar's realtime patches to allow control application development 
    now. There are two other labs in our department which allows dualboot to 
    Debian (about 20 more systems). More Linux (Debian, Gentoo, Slackware, 
    etc..) based systems (servers and desktops) are used by department staff 
    and to drive other projects.

    Debian has the advantage of a very broad package repository and seamless 
    maintenance. It does not enforce complicated configuration tools and allows 
    adaptation to our specific needs.
