  In November 2003, it was decided that all new Unix servers will run Debian
  GNU/Linux, except where vendor support contracts require otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  As of June 2006, more than 50 of our 90 central Unix servers run Debian. 
  These deliver services like email, DNS, DHCP, Radius, LDAP, web applications 
  and version control.  For <a href="http://www.surfnet.nl/">SURFnet</a>, the 
  ISP for universities in The Netherlands, we deliver lots of services using the 
  Debian platform: the Mailman-based 
  <a href="http://www.non-gnu.uvt.nl/mailman-ssls/">SURFnet Secure List 
  Server</a> the <a href="http://detective.surfnet.nl/">SURFnet Network 
  Detective</a>; machines for implementing a backend for the <q>SURFnet 
  Fedaratie<q> based upon the <a href="http://www.a-select.org/">A-Select 
  Authentication System</a>, and a <a href="http://wwwkeys.nl.pgp.net:11371/">\
  OpenPGP Keyserver</a>.
</p>
<p>
  We've chosen Debian for its reliable security update availability, strong 
  presence on the GNU/Linux server market, because of available knowledge and 
  experience in the UvT sysadmin group, flexibility of the OS, no license 
  costs (not even for security updates), and possibility to run a locally 
  controlled software distribution server.
