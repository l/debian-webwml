#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  In November 2003, it was decided that all new servers will run Debian
  GNU/Linux, except where vendor support contracts require otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, more than ten of the central servers run Debian.  We'll likely
  have about 20 servers running Debian soon, for services like e-mail, DNS,
  DHCP, Usenet News and version control.
</p>
<p>
  We've chosen Debian for its reliable security update availability, strong 
  presence on the GNU/Linux server market, because of available knowledge and 
  experience in the UvT sysadmin group, flexibility of the OS, no license 
  costs (not even for security updates), and possibility to run a locally 
  controlled software distribution server.
