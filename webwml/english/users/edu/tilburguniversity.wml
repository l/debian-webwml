#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  In November 2003, it was decided that all new Unix servers will run Debian
  GNU/Linux, except where vendor support contracts require otherwise.
</p>
<p>
  As of April 2012, more than 2 out of 3 of our over 150 central Unix servers run Debian. 
  These deliver services like email, DNS, DHCP, Radius, LDAP, web applications 
  and version control.
</p>
<p>
  We've chosen Debian for its reliable security update availability, strong 
  presence on the GNU/Linux server market, because of available knowledge and 
  experience in the UvT sysadmin group, flexibility of the OS, no license 
  costs (not even for security updates), and possibility to run a locally 
  controlled software distribution server.
