<p>
  At University of Valencia (Spain) Debian "woody" is used as
  development platform for the workstations of the
  <a href="http://robotica.uv.es/grupos/artec/SimCivil/en_index.html">Dynamics Simulation Group</a>
  of the Robotics Institute. There are also a file server and a CVS
  repository. The reason to use Debian has been mainly its high
  stability and security, and its package management system.
