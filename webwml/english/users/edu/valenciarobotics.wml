<p>
  At University of Valencia (Spain) Debian "etch" is used as 
  development platform for the workstations of the 
  <a href="http://robotica.uv.es/LSYM">\
  Laboratorio de Simulación y Modelado LSYM</a>
  of the Robotics Institute.  There are also a file server, 
  an issue tracker and a Subversion repository on a machine using Debian 
  "sarge". The reason to use Debian has been mainly its high 
  stability and security, and its package management system.
