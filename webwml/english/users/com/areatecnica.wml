#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We are using Debian on 100% of branch office servers (75 units), 100%
VPN routers for external ATM (15 units), 80% of central servers (43 units,
distributed systems, non host part), and 40% of desktops (160 units).
</p>
<p>
These data are dated end of 2010. Since then, Caja de Guadalajara has
joined Cajasol, and Cajasol has joined Banca CÃ­vica in 2011.
Technological resources are currently being reorganized,
so, we can not write exactly amounts of systems with Debian.
</p>
<p>
  We have chosen Debian because of stability, functionality, level of
  development, flexibility and adaptability. We like Debian.
