<p>
  We are using Debian for now on some servers and communication services,
  18 computers currently, for our firewall, corporate web server, VPN, 
  routers and application servers. All of them currently are using woody.
  Debian is our preferred operating system, but we are now using some
  other OSs.
</p>
<p>
  We have chosen Debian because of stability, functionality, level of
  development, flexibility and adaptability. We like Debian.
