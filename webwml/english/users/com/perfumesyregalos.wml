<p>
    www.perfumesyregalos.com is a PHP + MySQL e-shop based on Prestashop.  Our 
    main activity is selling perfumes and beauty products.  We use Debian on our 
    local server in order to provide a testing platform and a safe and stable 
    means for backups and a software repository.  Our main hosting provider uses 
    Debian too, with lighttp as webserver, PHP, python, and a lot more packages.
    Our programming staff uses Debian on their development workstations.  
    They're experienced GNU/Linux users and use Debian for programming other 
    kinds of web applications with Python and Django.
