    We employ one workstation for inventory/financial management (including 
    payroll), and one server (web, DNS, e-mail), both running Debian 
    GNU/Linux <q>lenny</q>.  Our workstation is a simple setup using the Xfce 
    desktop with GNU Cash and some other proprietary financial software. The 
    server runs Apache, MySQL, PHP, MyDNS-ng, Postfix, Courier, ISPConfig, 
    b2evolution, and Squirrelmail.

    We chose Debian for its rock-solid stability, ease of installation and 
    configuration, and awesome ability to not only run on old, second-hand
    hardware, but to turn that hardware into powerful production machines
    perfect for our needs.  We also like Debian's Social Contract. None of the
    other options were as successful in this implementation.  Thank you Debian
    GNU/Linux for the freedom and flexibility! Truly the Universal Operating
    System.
