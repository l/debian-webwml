#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We provide web, mail and file services on-site to our SME
  customers. After being long time SuSE users, we switched completely over
  to Debian GNU/Linux one and a half year ago. The online upgrade
  facilities greatly reduced the need for on-site technical work, reducing
  cost both for our customers and us. Especially the quick online security
  updates and the ease of installation reduce the administrative load on
  our decent number of deployed systems.
