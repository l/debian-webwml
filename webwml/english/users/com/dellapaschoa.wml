#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Actually we have one server, three software development workstations and one 
    laptop using Debian.  Today we use C++, CGI, Gtkmm, Glade and PostgreSQL for 
    all.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is the most secure, stable and robust distribution of GNU/Linux. 
    We are very satisfied with this choice.
