#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have deployed Debian on our customer's servers, and have installed more 
    than a thousand servers.  We are an IT company which develops for Linux.  
    Currently we install our products on a Debian platform.
</p>

<p>
    We believe that Debian has the most information related to the distribution 
    and the available packages.
