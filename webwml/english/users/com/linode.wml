<p>
    Linode, a cloud hosting company, offers Debian as a distribution option to 
    our 400,000-plus customers. When deploying a new Linode, Debian is the 
    default Linux Distribution for our customers.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian as the default option because of its long life cycle and 
    reputation for stability.  To that end, our Distro Template Team keeps all 
    Debian images up to date and ready for deployment. Also, Debian is one of 
    the core distributions that all Linode Guides and Tutorials are written to 
    support.
