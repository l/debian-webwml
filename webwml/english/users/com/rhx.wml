#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Debian is the operating system we use on all servers for hosting services
    and embedded devices as router and firewall. We also use Debian for our 
    laptops and workstations.
</p>

<p>
    We offer single-sign-on solutions with OpenLDAP, postifx and Phamm 
front-end.
</p>

<p>
    We choose Debian for: large availability of software, stability,
    security and performant packaging system.
