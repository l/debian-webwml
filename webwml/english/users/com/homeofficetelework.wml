#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We had computers that ran Windows OS, but it was very expensive for us. For
  this reason we started to research the Linux World for one year to find out 
  if it is a stable, robust and secure distribution.  We came to a logical 
  conclusion: we found Debian GNU/Linux.

<p>
  We installed Debian on all servers, workstations and laptops. Each day, we 
  are learning about Debian but the whole company knows that Debian is the 
  most secure, stable and robust distribution of GNU/Linux. We are very 
  satisfied with this choice. Thanks to all Debian's Developers.
