#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use a single Debian (Sarge) workstation on our internal network to aid
  and assist our development software and support team. We run bugzilla to
  track internal bugs, and request tracker to track and manage requests from
  our customers.
</p>
<p>
  We have an intranet that allows developers to access viewCVS, bonsai and
  doxygen.  We've found Debian to be stable and flexible, with a good range of
  supported packages.
