<p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux since year 2002 and are now it on six servers 
    for applications, mail, web, proxy, DNS, DHCP, VPN and databases.  We also 
    have it running on 44 workstations. 
</p>
    
<p>
    We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of its quality and amount of packages, 
    existing documentation and its freedom.
