#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Our three companies share one office landscape. We have one Debian server 
    that we use for: ssh gateway to access all other machines by ssh, IMAP 
    server, and squid reverse proxy server for an internal webserver.  We have 
    also used Debian as a firewall (openvpn, firewall.sh, iptables) between 
    the Internet and an internal subnet.
</p>

<p>
    We chose to use Debian because we had heard it was the most stable Linux 
    server. Debian is installed in server mode without desktop software like 
    X/Gnome. We have been using Debian for three years.
