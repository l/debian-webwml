#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Our three companies share one office landscape. We have one Debian server 
    that we use for: ssh gateway to access all other machines by ssh, IMAP 
    server, and squid reverse proxy server for an internal webserver.  We have 
    also used Debian as a firewall (openvpn, firewall.sh, iptables) between 
    the Internet and an internal subnet.
</p>

<p>
    We chose to use Debian because we had heard it was the most stable Linux 
    server. Debian is installed in server mode without desktop software like 
    X/Gnome. We have been using Debian for three years.
</p>

<p>
    We have recently added another Debian server to our landscape, replacing a 
    Red Hat 9 OS. Red Hat 9 was causing our IBM server to shut down 
    unexpectedly, almost every day. We installed Skolelinux 2.0 Sarge
    with KDE (from the DebianEdu project) and it has run stable since the
    day we installed it =) we love Debian!  On this new server (skolelinux) we 
    are running a demo website for potential customers, using WebLogic 8.1,
    J2EE and Oracle 9i.
