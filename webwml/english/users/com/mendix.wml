<p>
    Mendix is a Rapid App Development Platform. The complete Mendix hosting 
    platform is running on Debian, both VMs and hypervisors, currently (April 
    2015) about 3600 installs. The majority of these nodes run Mendix Apps 
    (java) and PostgreSQL databases. But also these services run on top of 
    Debian: backup servers (rsync, btrfs snapshots), routers (bird), 
    webservers (nginx), loadbalancers (keepalived), vpn (openvpn, 
    ipsec-tools/racoon), nameservers (bind), mailservers (postfix), vcs
    servers (git/svn), monitoring servers (nagios/munin). And, of course,
    the people who manage these nodes also run Debian on their desktop.

    We are an incredibly happy Debian user (and contributor) because it is rock 
    solid and we love free and open-source software.
