<p>
    NG Communications is a Belgian telecommunications and managed hosting 
    company.  We've been using Debian on our servers for almost 10 years, 
    including servers that we manage for our customers.  In total we manage over 
    30 servers, using the applications Apache, Nginx, Pure-FTPd, MySQL, 
    PostgreSQL, Postfix and Dovecot on top of Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian for its advanced package management system, excellent 
    security updates and overall stability.
