<p>
    Probanauchpribor LLC uses Debian as Internet and LAN servers (Samba as 
    Windows domain controller), and desktop OS for software development for 
    embedded systems. But the organization have many more Windows machines.
</p>

<p>
    As server platform Debian was chosen for its excellent stability,
    reliability and security updates. As development platform Debian was chosen 
    for availability of software without the need to build and install by hand.
