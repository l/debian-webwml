#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian throughout our whole self-managed infrastructure, including 
    application servers (Ruby on Rails), frontend servers (using HAProxy, 
    Varnish and nginx), database servers (using MariaDB, MongoDB and 
    Elasticsearch), virtualization servers (using Ganeti with KVM), virtual 
    machines and routers (using BIRD, keepalived, pimd etc.) for a total of 
    almost 400 systems. Additionally most of our 120 staff use Debian on their 
    workstations and laptops on a daily basis.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian over the competition because of software availability, 
    high quality standards, stability, comprehensive security support and 
    reasonable release cycle.
</p>

<p>
    For more in-depth analysis on how we use Debian, please have a look at 
    the relevant DebConf16 presentation:
