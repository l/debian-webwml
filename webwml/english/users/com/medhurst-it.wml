<p>
    We have Debian running on almost 50 production servers; a number that is
    growing every week.  We offer a variety of solutions utilising the Debian 
    platform (including web content filtering, firewall services, anti-spam 
    services, web hosting, mail hosting, routing and VPN tunnelling, among 
    others) that provide a secure and stable platform for all of our customers 
    subscribing to our services.

    We looked at a number of Linux distributions before settling on Debian.  It 
    was not a tough decision to make in the end, Debian offered the perfect 
    balance between security, stability and ease of administration.  Debian 
    allowed us to expand on our predominantly Microsoft focused customer base in 
    ways that were no possible without investing in bespoke applications and/or 
    hardware.  While Microsoft products have their many advantages, rarely are 
    you able to build beyond what is on offer out of the box.  Linux made this 
    possible and Debian made this process very, very simple indeed.
