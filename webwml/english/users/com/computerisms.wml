#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use a combination of Debian servers and Ubuntu workstations to build or 
    enhance networks for ourselves and several other small-medium sized 
    businesses and organizations, often in cross-platform environments.  Our 
    Debian servers mostly run software like Samba, Request-Tracker, Ledgersmb, 
    and Mediawiki, but we also have hosting services where we use Apache2 and 
    Qmail, along with various supporting software.  Another common use we use 
    Debian for is firewall and bandwidth management solutions, using software 
    like iptables/xtables, Openswan, and Squid/Dansguardian.

<p>
    The preference for Debian originates from apt, many years ago.  Continued 
    devotion stems from excellent documentation and adherence to open standards, 
    both of which have served very well to prevent the need to look elsewhere.
