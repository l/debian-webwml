<p>
  Ematic Interactive uses Debian because we think it is the most stable and
  secure platform for the web applications, web solutions and extranets we
  build for our clients. 
</p>
<p>    
  We run Debian on our web servers, e-mail servers, proxy servers and file 
  servers. It is used in combination with software like Apache, MySQL, PHP, 
  Bind, Samba, Squid, Snort and many others. This gives our clients the best 
  open source solution available!
