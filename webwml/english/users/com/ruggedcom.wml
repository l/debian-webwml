<p>
    Besides using a number of Debian servers to manage our development builds, 
    testing platforms and developer desktops, we manufacture industrial routers 
    that are Debian based. We take hardened high quality hardware and load it 
    with Debian.
</p>
    
<p>
    We chose Debian because of its consistency, from its rigid adherence to the 
    file system hierarchy and its regular way of reporting changes to its 
    strategy of managing change.
