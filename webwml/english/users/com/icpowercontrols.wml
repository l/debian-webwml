<p>
    We started installing Debian Linux on our internal servers and on our client 
    servers several years ago. Now we are installing Debian GNU/Linux on our 
    embedded industrial systems. 
</p>
<p>
    We selected Debian because it is very reliable, it just keeps working
    without any problems.
