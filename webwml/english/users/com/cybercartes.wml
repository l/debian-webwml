#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have been using four Debian powered servers for five years. We are also 
  using Debian for our development workstations. The main software we use are
  Apache, MySQL, Postfix, PHP, and Perl. 
</p>
<p>
  We are using and trusting Debian due to the great stability and the software 
  packaging engine it offers to us.
