<p>
  United Drug is a leading provider of services to pharmaceutical
  retailers and manufacturers. It is the largest pharmaceutical
  wholesaler on the island of Ireland.  It is also the market leader
  in contract distribution outsourcing (pre-wholesaling) in Ireland
  and has achieved No. 1 position in the UK through its joint
  venture with Alliance UniChem - UDG.

  We currently use Debian on two servers, providing webmail, DNS,
  network monitoring, fax services, numerous internal web
  applications (CRM, Helpdesk, etc.) and other core network
  services. We are planning on more Debian installations in the
  future as we migrate services from WinNT to GNU/Linux.  We chose
  Debian because of the ease of maintenance (nothing beats
  apt-get!), and the biggest reason of all, stability.
