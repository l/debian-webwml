<p>
    ProbeSys is a company dedicated to free software services. We are using 
    Debian on our desktops and we are using it to operate all our customers' 
    servers; which run Posfix, openLDAP, squid, backupPC, GLPI, OCS, heartbeat, 
    Samba, Nagios, Apache, eGroupWare, wifidog, etc. We've chosen it for its 
    security and stability.
