<p>The makers of the
online game <a href="http://secondlife.com/">Second Life</a> run Debian on
their server farm of about 2000 Intel and AMD based servers.  Ian Wilkes,
Director of Operations, explains their choice of operating system: <q>Debian
provides a stable, high-quality distribution supported by
responsive and responsible package maintainers.  It's a key component
of our low-overhead server operations strategy.</q></p>
