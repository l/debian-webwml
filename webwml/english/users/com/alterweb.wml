    <p>AlterWeb supplies webshops based on and hosting for Magento. We distinguish 
    ourselves by focusing on security, speed, reliability and good service. Debian
    is used for all our servers, desktops and laptops.</p>

    <p>We compile Debian from source packages for an optimal configuration on our 
    servers. They are managed with Ansible and we use NGINX, PHP, MySQL, Redis, 
    Varnishe and New Relic packages</p>

    <p>On our workstations we run many different programs such as Sublime, GIMP, 
    Inkscape, FileZilla, Libre Office, Team Viewer, Opera, Chrome, and Firefox.</p>

    <p>We have chosen Debian because of it's reliability, it has minimal consumption 
    of resources and the great package manager (APT).</p>
