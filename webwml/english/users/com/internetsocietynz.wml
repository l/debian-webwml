<p>
  From 14 October 2002 the systems for registering domains in the
  .nz cctld will be running on 10 Dell 2650 servers running Debian
  "woody".  This application will be released under the GPL next
  year including full implementations of client and server software
  for registering domains within a ccTLD. The application is built
  using a mix of PostgreSQL, Apache and mod_perl and includes custom
  replication architecture for replication and redundancy.
