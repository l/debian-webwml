#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    The platform was originally designed by different owners, but there was an 
    ownership transfer and now it is maintained by us.  It has always been based 
    on Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We love Debian because of its flexibility, ease of maintenance and the fact 
    that there are lots of available software which pass through internal Q&amp;A. 
    Also, it is free of vendors' restrictions.  The number of 
    workstations/servers are ~30/400 including physical and virtual machines.
