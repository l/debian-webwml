  Within the scope of its business activities to which it is authorized, T-Mobile
  Czech Republic establishes and operates a public mobile communication network
  on the GSM standard in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands and provides mobile
  telecommunications services pertaining to this network. The comprehensive
  character of the services provided lies especially in the extensive range of
  products and possible combinations thereof. Customers can choose from a wide

<p>
  T-Mobile Czech Republic use Debian GNU/Linux on more than 100 servers from 
  small and medium range SMP to high-end NUMA servers. T-Mobile Czech Republic
  migrated many of customer-oriented and foreign partners oriented Internet
  services to the best available open source solution during the year 2000.
  The Debian GNU/Linux distribution is now the preferred platform for most of 
  our growing number of enterprise Internet services and applications for our
  customers and partners.

<p>
  We chose Debian for many reasons: flexibility, robustness, stability, 
  adaptability, functionality, quality assurance, the large number of well tested 
  packages, superior and sophisticated package management system and easy 
  upgrading mechanism, security issues, support for many ways of installation on
  many architectures and platforms, perfect support for remote administration,
  and many, many more ... We can only say: apt-get into it!
