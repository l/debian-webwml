<p>
T-Mobile Czech Republic a. s. (hereinafter T-Mobile)
  operates a public mobile communications network
  on the GSM standard in the 900 and 1800 MHz bands and
is also authorized to operate a UMTS network.

Since 1st January 2008, T-Mobile has been providing high-speed internet
connection services based on ADSL technology and offering voice
services via a public fixed-line electronic communications network.

In 2009, T-Mobile extended its portfolio to include the ICT services and
as of November 2010, the operator also offers the satellite T-Mobile TV.

Since its establishment, the company has placed emphasis on the
quality of offered services, excellent customer service and proper
conduct towards business partners, employees and the environment.
</p>
<p>
T-Mobile uses Debian GNU/Linux on servers from
  small and medium range SMP to high-end NUMA servers. T-Mobile
  migrated some of customer-oriented and foreign partners oriented Internet
  services to the best available open source solution during the year 2000.

  The Debian GNU/Linux distribution is now one of
several preferred Linux distributions for most of
  growing number of enterprise Internet services and applications for T-Mobile
  customers and partners.	  
</p>
<p>
T-Mobile chose
 Debian GNU/Linux for many reasons: flexibility, robustness, stability,
  adaptability, functionality, quality assurance, the large number of well tested 
  packages, superior and sophisticated package management system and easy 
  upgrading mechanism, security issues, support for many ways of installation on
  many architectures and platforms, perfect support for remote administration,
  and many, many moreâ€¦ We can only say: apt-get into it!
