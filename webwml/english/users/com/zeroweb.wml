#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  I have used Debian for years, I have tried all other flavors of Linux
  but none compare to the robustness and ease of use that Debian has
  produced from the day I started using it. We use it on all 3 servers
  here and it is also implemented in our Virtual Server platform and each
  customer has Debian running as a Virtual Server.
