<p>
  Chemlab.org is a 24/7 streaming media shop, powered by Debian since day
  one.  Debian's best point is that everything works _together_
  perfectly.  The global effort certainly produced an amazing product.  We
  wouldn't even consider another distribution.  The ease of upgrades and
  maintenance is great- administration tasks become almost automated.
