#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Whether we talk about workstations or servers we run purely on Debian 
    GNU/Linux.  In regards to servers we use Debian for multiple webservers, DNS 
    server, firewall and database.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because we believe in the <q>Debian Social Contract</q>, as 
    well as for it's stability and performance.
