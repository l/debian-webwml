#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use the Debian operating system due to ease of implementation.
</p>

<p>
    Our applications, available through SaaS, as well as the traditional 
    distribution model, runs on Debian servers.
</p>

<p>
    The decision to use Debian was based on the selection of additional 
    expandable components, availability of the distribution, a regular cycle 
    for issuing updates, stability and support solutions for a wide range of 
    equipment for dedicated server solutions.
