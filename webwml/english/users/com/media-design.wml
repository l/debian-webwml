#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are a webhosting provider that offers domain registration, shared hosting 
    and dedicated servers.  When we started in 2000 we chose Debian for various 
    reasons, the most important one being that Debian's packaging system and 
    tools were far superior to other distributions at the time.
</p>

<p>
    Since then other distributions have caught up in that respect, but Debian 
    remains our choice for dozens of servers (web, database, mail, DNS, etc) and 
    a few desktops, both in the datacenter and at the office.  Its reliability, 
    maintainability, security support and licensing remain top-notch and ensure we 
    can provide excellent quality to our customers.
