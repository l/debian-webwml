#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use two Debian servers to store our applications and all kinds of work 
    files.  On the servers we have installed Apache, MySQL, Samba, Gallery for 
    photos, and a FTP server.  Also, we have three terminals with Debian, office 
    utilities, and with access to the management system installed on the servers.

<p>
    We decided to use Debian because of its stability, robustness and also by 
    recommendation of people we trust.  It did not seem difficult to us to use 
    this distribution.  Previously we used operating systems and programs from 
    MS, but the high cost of licenses, added to the instability and insecurity, 
    made it easy for us to decide to use Linux.
