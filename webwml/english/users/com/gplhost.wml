    GPLHost is a web hosting company that focuses on open source technology. 
    GPLHost has been successfully serving customers since 2003. Our slogan is 
    <q>open source hosting worldwide</q>. All our servers run under Debian (except 
    specific requirements from customers) as we believe it's the best solution 
    for many reasons.

<p>
    We are contributing to the open source effort in building hosting tools,
    creating a common effort in lowering the costs of hosting. We develop and
    provide all our software under Debian. Our control panel, DTC, is now one of 
    the best open source solution for web hosting, with compatibility with all 
    the software you would need. We bring the best support for this control 
    panel, custom on-demand features, popularity and reliability.  (See

    We have based our business on establishing many partnerships with small as
    well as big companies, establishing branches all around the world. GPLHost
    do team work with individual programmers coming from different origins who
    contribute to the coding of our hosting platform, and work with the big 
    actors of the industry. They help us have an efficient support system, along 
    with good connectivity around the world. In each location we provide 
    hosting, we manage to complete on-site hardware maintenance in under one
