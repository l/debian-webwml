#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on all our remote locations (Samba/NFS/ISC-DHCP/BIND/tinc), on 
    our physical servers and most of our virtual machines hosting our internal 
    services (LAMP mostly). This all accounts for a dozen of servers running on 
    Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of its ease of use, its openness and its amazing 
    community that delivers overall a stable and nice Linux distribution. Debian 
    is also our first choice when we provide Linux training.
