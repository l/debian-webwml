#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian lenny in our office.  We have 7 physical servers and ~10 
    virtual servers, each of them is running Debian.  The servers provide 
    essentially all of the company's services, including (but not limited 
    to) web serving, database serving, IP telephony and IP video surveillance. 
    Also there are about 20 workstations running Debian.  We also use Debian on 
    about 70 diskless 'fat clients' to provide access to our web-based 
    accounting and management system.
