<p>
The Telegraaf Media Group (TMG) uses Debian
GNU/Linux as its preferred operating system for
almost all of its Internet activities. Examples among these 400+ computers
include firewalls, load balancers, mail servers, web servers,
  name servers, database servers, etc.
</p>
<p>
In Debian GNU/Linux, we found a stable and rock-solid
solution which is up-to-date as well. We used to create
our own <q>freeze</q> distributions out of <q>unstable</q> every
once in a while, but nowadays base it on the frequently
released <q>stable</q>.
