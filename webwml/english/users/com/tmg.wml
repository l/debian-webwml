  De Telegraaf uses Debian GNU/Linux as its preferred operating system for 
  almost all of its Internet activities. Examples among these 100+ computers 
  include firewalls, routers, load balancers, mail servers, web servers, 
  name servers, database servers, etc.

<p>
  Creating our own 'Freeze' out of 'Unstable' every once in a while, we have 
  found, in Debian GNU/Linux, a stable and rock-solid solution which is 
  up-to-date as well.
