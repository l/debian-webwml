#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian Stable on servers (Internet and LAN) and Debian Testing 
    on workstations for daily office work.
</p>

<p>
    Debian was chosen for its excellent repository and easy managment.  
    Reliability, powerful user-friendly work-environment is important to us, 
    too.
