#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Debian was chosen as the preferred operating system due to simplicity and 
    ease of use.  It is currently deployed on 2 workstations and 1 server.  The 
    server is running X11 VNC and provides fast central network attached storage 
    for all LAN workstations.
