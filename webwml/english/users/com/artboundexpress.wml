  When it came time to have an outside firm develop a robust
  administrative system and order fulfillment system for our e-commerce
  business, the Debian platform was chosen over other commercial Unixes.
  We now have 5 machines running. More than a few of our administrators
  and developers have been impressed with how security is handled on the
  platform and the total flexibility, although we still have our share
  of Windows around here.

<p>
  We've done very little tweaking, but have enjoyed the work that others
  have accomplished. When I noticed that the Debian Project was looking
  for testimonials, I was happy to oblige. All in all, it was a wise
  choice and hasn't let us down. And the price was right!
