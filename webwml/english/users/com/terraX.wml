#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We all use Debian as desktop and as server. We are webprovider and all
    our machines are running Debian. At last we made a Sarge-update.
</p>

<p>
    The main software on all desktops is Firefox version 1.5 and 
    Thunderbird. For programming we use ZEND, it works very well.  But also 
    multimedia tools like XMMS and realplayer are in use.  My best designs I 
    create with my beloved GIMP.  I've used Debian for nearly 5 years, my 
    partner too.

    We have a lot of machines, and we never had problems with 
    Debian. No crashes, no hangs!  During the time using Debian, we have had 
    to reinstall the secretaries Windows desktop 20 times.  We also tried 
    SuSE, Mandrake and Red Hat, but like Windows, they too have become similar
    to playstations.

<p>
    The completely working APT is nice, because the latest software is always 
    available on PC, which I've never seen on a Windows PC at this price! :D
</p>

<p>
    Personally I would never use another platform, also I would never accept
    another platform on our servers. Debian machines run forever.
