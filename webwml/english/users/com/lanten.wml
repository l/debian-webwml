<p>
    Using Debian on all of our servers was maybe one of the best decisions 
    we've ever made. After 3000+ domains, 2000+ mysql databases and 10000+ 
    e-mail addresses on 10+ machines we've still not experienced problems 
    due to the operating system.

<p>
    We started using it because of our hosting admin being a Debian-maniac. 
    We still find it fine &mdash; sophisticated packet handling, security, 
    reliability, scalability.
