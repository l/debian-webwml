#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian on eight of our servers (64-bit versions), and on two of 
    our workstations. Our servers are running applications written in PHP or 
    Ruby, database software (mysql, postgresql), SMTP server, DNS, and ftp.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because it is a community, and a simple, stable 
    distribution.
