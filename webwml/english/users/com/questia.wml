<p>
    Questia.com (the world's largest online library) extensively use Debian, and 
    love love love it!  A large majority of our production systems are Debian 
    based.  For example, our reverse proxy/http layer is Debian running Apache. 
    Our application tier is Tomcat running on Debian, and there are a ton of 
    miscellaneous back office things running on Debian.  We love you guys.
