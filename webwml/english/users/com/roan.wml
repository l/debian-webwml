#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian on 2 of our main Proxmox based virtual servers, which 
    run and support an additional 6 Debian based servers.
</p>

<p>
    We also run a desktop installation in our company for our admin, and a 
    "bare metal" server for backup, local DNS, and file sharing. The server
    is also used by our web designers for testing new websites and web 
    based applications.
</p>

<p>
    We use Apache, Nginx, Exim, Mysql and Samba, with support for PHP, ruby 
    and python. We have an additional server for testing of new configurations
    and benchmarking.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is our main server system because it's stable, has a good community 
    and a large volume of available documentation online.
