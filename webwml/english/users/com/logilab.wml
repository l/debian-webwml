<p>
    Logilab is a company that has been using, promoting, installing, supporting 
    and maintaining Debian for over 10 years.
</p>
<p>
We have been using Debian since 2002 or 2003 and have had DDs on staff
since then. We sponsor DebConf and give time to Julien Cristau when he
needs some for his work as a release assistant.
