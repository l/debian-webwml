#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We run about eight servers, all running Debian, serving one of the
  largest online tech news sites in Norway.  Debian provides good and
  timely security updates and its developers are usually quite
  responsive to bug reports and such.  We'll be continuing running
  Debian.
