<p>
At Backblaze, we provide unlimited storage to our customers for only $5 per
month, so we had to figure out how to store hundreds of petabytes of customer
data in a reliable, scalable way &mdash; and keep our costs low. After looking at
several overpriced commercial solutions, we decided to build our own custom
Backblaze Storage Pods: 67 terabyte 4U servers for $7,867. A Backblaze Storage
Pod isnâ€™t a complete building block until it boots and is on the network. The
pods boot 64-bit Debian 4 Linux and the JFS file system, and they are
self-contained appliances, where all access to and from the pods is through
HTTPS.
