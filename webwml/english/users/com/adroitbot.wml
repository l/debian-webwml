    <a href="http://www.newzwiz.com/">NewsWiz</a> is our big-data-API As A 
    Service platform delivering financial market insights based on open

    We migrated to Debian over other Linux distributions due to its stability 
    and low resource footprint. We are machine learning experts and work on 
    text. Our distributed product platform is built on top of multiple Debian 
    machines and thus our users get high throughput/stability and security as 
    our core offerings.
