#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    In our Oceanography Department, all servers are running in adverse 
    environmental conditions.  These servers are working on continuous data 
    acquisition from underwater sensor networks.

    We chose the Debian operating system because it is very stable and scalable; 
    we can install Debian on small computers with ARM processors to put them 
    inside a marine buoy, or we can use Debian on powerful servers to run large 
    oceanographic models.
