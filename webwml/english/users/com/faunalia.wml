<p>
    We have been using Debian in its many flavours (from oldstable to unstable) 
    since 2000, both on servers and on desktops.  We focus on Geographic 
    Information Systems (GIS), collaborating with the DebianGIS project since 
    its inception.
</p>

<p>
    We selected Debian because of its rigorous approach to licencing, its ease 
    of use, and stability.
