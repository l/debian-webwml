<p>
    For the last seven years, we have been using a Debian server installed with 
    the ZFS filesystem. The server holds company's data served through sshfs, a 
    dolibarr ERP, the company's website with Joomla and mail archives with 
    dovecot. Data backup is done off-site with a rsync synchronisation.  There 
    are also five Ubuntu workstations.  Thanks to Debian team for the fantastic 
    work!
