<p>
    The company counts a network of thirty servers, five of which are on the 
    Internet.  We have been using the Debian distribution since July 2006 for
    mail (postfix), web (apache2), proxy (squid), FTP (proftpd).  We migrated 
    from Windows 2003 Server to Linux.  "A better world is possible" ... and
    we are enchanted.
