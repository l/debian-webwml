#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on all of our company workstations and servers (about a dozen 
    of each), and on 99 procent of the servers we deploy and support for our 
    customers (hundreds).  We primarily use Perl, PostgreSQL and MySQL, 
    Apache/mod_perl, HTML::Mason, and LaTeX.  The company founder has been a 
    Debian developer since 2001.

<p>
    We use Debian because of the rock-solid stable releases, painless remote 
    upgrades and security support for oldstable for a full year.  Debian's 
    packaging of Perl CPAN libraries is vast and second-to-none.  The PostgreSQL 
    upgrade path that decouples database upgrade from OS upgrade is invaluable.  
    We appreciate that Debian is not developed by a single company.
