<p>
  Frogfoot (ISP) runs Debian on most of our servers and all our workstations.
  The thing we like best about Debian in this environment is the clean upgrade
  path. We have machines that have been upgraded from the Hamm days,
  without a re-install, currently running the latest software versions.
