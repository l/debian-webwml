<p>
    We are using Debian for not only mail, web and DNS but also file, print and 
    database servers.  In addition, our many desktop clients and notebook 
    computers are Debianaised.  Windows systems are used only in VMware which
    is installed in Debian.  We also sell Debian systems to many customers
    which amounts to more than 50 systems.  Micorsoft Office and Adobe 
    Photoshop, Illustrator are replaced by Openoffice.org and Gimp in our 
    office.  Our financial, operational and informational systems are actually 
    working on Debian.  Debian is powerful and is keeping the originality of 
    Linux.
