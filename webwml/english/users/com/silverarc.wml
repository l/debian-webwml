#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Being a solutions provider/consulting company, we use and support
three Linux Distributions Debian, CentOS/RHEL, openSUSE.
 We use Debian because it can scale from a very small installation
(embedded systems) to a large scale server. Even though there is no a
centralized administration tool like openSUSE's yast or CentOS/RHEL's
setup program, the CLI/curses dialogs are fairly comprehensive to get
a base installation going. The configuration files are well documented
with comments and examples for further refinements. And lastly because of its vast repository of packages.
