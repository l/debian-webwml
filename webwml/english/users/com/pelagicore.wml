#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on our web servers because we find it stable, easy to use, 
    full-featured with the software we want, secure, and conformant to our 
    belief in Open Source.  We also use Debian internally as a development 
    platform and recommend it to our customers.  We have a couple of 
    instances of Debian Squeeze running git, svn, apache, exim, ldap, sftp, 
    as well as various other services.
</p>

<p>
    We try to contribute to Debian actively and have sponsored DebConf, as 
    well as contribute package maintenance and other work to Debian.
