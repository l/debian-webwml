    Baldwin Linguas is a small language services agency, providing translation, 
    interpreting, and localization services and multi-lingual web design and 
    mastery.
</p>

<p>
    We have used GNU/Linux since inception, having used Fedora, PCLinuxOS and 
    Ubuntu, and even rolling our own (LinguasOS, based on PCLinuxOS) for a 
    while, but finally joined the Mothership around early 2009, and haven't 
    looked back since.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike other distros, Debian Stable seems to never break stuff.  It lives 
    up to its name, so we can focus on our translation work, rather than waste 
    time fixing stuff.  Heck, even in the upgrade from Lenny to Stable, Debian 
    just worked.  Took a couple of hours to apt-get the upgrade, and B00M, we 
    were back to work, seemlessly.  Amazing! (especially cool that Squeeze was 
    released on my birthday!)
</p>

<p>
    We use Debian on all desktop computers in-house, and our 1 in-house server 
    (in-house server mostly used for file server over ftp, ssh, and a Pootle 
    installation, plus internal dokuwiki. Our main website is hosted 
    off-premises on a CentOS server, sadly).  Our most used applications are 
    OmegaT (this one we install from the project, itself, since Debian's 
    version is old), OpenOffice.org, for translation work, Vim and Iceweasel 
    (online research, communications) for web services work.  I (owner) use 
    Mutt for e-mail.  We use GIMP for creation and manipulation of graphics for 
    web services work and marketing materials.  Many gnu and bash tools see 
    regular use, with a lot of scripting to automate much of the manipulation 
    of textual materials (especially sed, awk, perl).  Everything, really, is 
    on our Debian machines, including all the boring, back-office admin stuff, 
    all webdev tools, all translation tools, all word processing, everything.
</p>

<p>
    If I had to try and use Windows for this stuff, I'd probably shoot myself.
