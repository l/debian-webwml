#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian to run our SMTP Proxy (sarge) (spam server) and our Network
  Management Server (woody) running JFFNMS.  There are a couple of desktops 
  that run Debian unstable just for fun running KDE.  
</p>
<p>
  We use Debian because the package management is so easy to use and the OS
  itself is very stable, even the unstable release.
