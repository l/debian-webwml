<p>
  Arena Sports is an indoor sports company that has five locations
  in the US and Canada exclusively using Debian GNU/Linux for all
  workstations and servers, including IPSec VPN routers.
</p>
<p>
  We have Debian workstations running as cash registers at each facility
  as well as providing office workstations for normal business
  administrative functions.
</p>
<p>
  We have developed custom software for managing indoor sports facilities
  and spun off another company called <a href="http://sports-it.com/">Sports-IT</a>
  which is a web-based facility management system, including
  point-of-sale.
</p>
<p>
  We have proved that Debian GNU/Linux is not just for the tech-savvy
  user, but can be readily embraced by anyone, including jocks. :)
</p>
<p>
  Debian's superior release infrastructure has been key in helping us keep
  down costs on the IT side. The accountants even love it.
