  We began using Debian in 2003, for implementing network servers for our
  customers ranging from small to medium size. All are based on the Intel x86 
  architecture, bringing them file services with Samba, DHCP server, firewall 
  and proxy server, SSH server for remote administration, etc. We also use 
  Debian on our server to handle centralized services like transparent proxy 
  with Squid, IPTABLES, SSH, DHCP server, intranet web server (for testing 
  purposes).

  I started with SuSE 6.1 in 2000, because it had good support for Spanish in
  Venezuela; that was my first Linux experience. After that I met Debian 
  in 2001.  I installed Debian, and started to learn and use it, and the more I 
  learned the more I liked it. So, we started to use Debian for production in 
  2003.

  I chose to use Debian because it's reliable, it has an excellent software
  management with the apt, it's really free and open.  Since then we use open 
  source software whenever it is possible.
