<p>
    We are using Debian on our four production servers, running the database 
    server, and a SMS platform developed by ourselves.  The SMTP server and 
    web server are also running Debian.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is a very mature product; stability, flexibility and documentation 
    is the best around.
