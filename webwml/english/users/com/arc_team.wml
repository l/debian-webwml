#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  The members of the Arc-Team (five archaeologists) run Debian and some other 
  GNU/Linux distributions on three PCs and five notebooks (our whole system). 
  We've installed Grass-GIS, different CADs, some applications for virtual 
  reconstruction, statistics, GPS and survey data management, databases 
  (MySQL), etc.
</p>
<p>
  We use it primarily because we're trying to introduce Open Source OS and 
  Open Source applications to the archaeological research. Besides we there 
  want to spread the philosophy of free software and free data exchange.
  In short, why do we use Debian? Because we want to be free!
