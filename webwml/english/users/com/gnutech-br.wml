#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We run Debian for everything, from desktops to servers.  We have application 
    servers over tomcat (running ERP), web site, e-mail, firewall, proxy, file 
    sharing, telephony/VoIP server, and a NMS.  Everything running on Debian.  
    The total is 16 virtual servers, split in two physical computers for 
    high-avaibility.
</p>

<p>
    We choose Debian to ease the burden of system administration.  Also because 
    Debian has very well maintaned packages and for high security (and of course 
    stability, that we include under security for logical reasons).
