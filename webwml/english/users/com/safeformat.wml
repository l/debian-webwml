    I have been using Debian Linux systems for the past five years and it is the 
    key aspect of my business.  This Open Source operating system provides 
    complete solutions for up to date information technology.  Security is a key 
    part to success in any professional implementation and Debian delivers 
    <q>The cream of the crop</q> approach.  A well tested and reliable Debian 
    solution have and will be the key to success for the future generation of 
    any IT deployment.  I am very honored to be able to be a small part of this 
    team of giants in all aspects of computer science.

    I thank everyone and praise all the developers, testers and users who keep 
    Debian and Opens Source alive!  Without Debian, the world would be a place 
    that has been painted in the books of a great novelist George Orwell 
    (Nineteen Eighty-Four).
