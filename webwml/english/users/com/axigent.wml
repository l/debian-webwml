<p>
  We run Debian on several servers including our web and E-mail server 
  (woody), file server (sarge) and our phone system, Asterisk PBX (sid).
</p>
<p>
  Debian is also deployed at our customers sites when they want a solid server 
  solution and aren't interested in Microsoft.  We also utilize Debian for 
  deploying SMTP Proxy Spam Filters for clients that already have a mail 
  server (all run sarge).  We push Debian whenever we can.  
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to Debian's stability and robust package management system it doesn't 
  make sense to use anything else.
