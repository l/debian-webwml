#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We are running Debian for several applications
both in-house and deployed at customer sites.
We use it for web and email service, Cacti
and MRTG graphing and to run Asterisk PBX.
We also use it as a base for SNMP monitoring,
network asset collection and trouble ticket systems.
</p>
<p>
We have Debian deployed on approximately 50 servers both in house
and at customer locations, serving all of these applications.
We continue to use Debian in environments when we need
a reliable server environment for a purpose-built task.
</p>
<p>
Debian has proven to be  extremely reliable
and we will continue to use and support Debian.
