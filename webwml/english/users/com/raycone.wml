#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian since 1998 since we believe it's the most stable Linux 
  distro around.
</p>
<p>
  We have 2 web and 3 development (Woody) servers running Debian plus 1 
  laptop with Potato.
</p>
<p>
  We are promoting this great OS amongst our clients for the widest kind of 
  uses such as firewall/router machines, DB servers and intranet servers.
