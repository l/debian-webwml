<p>
As an ISP with a diversified range of products we offer
disk space, domains and other services for web hosting.
We use Debian on all servers by default.
</p>
<p>
Our preconfigured web hosting packages provide perfect preconditions
for plenty of open source software like many CMS and Internet forums.

Our customer dedicated servers also use Debian.
</p>
<p>
We like Debian particularly for its stability and
productivity but also due to its elaborate architecture,
which allows convenient configuration of the system.
