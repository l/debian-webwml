<p>
We provide virtual servers and web hosting services since
2005 using Debian GNU/Linux as main operative system.
</p>
<p>
We own six powerful servers running the Xen
hypervisor on Debian stable to support our VPS offer.

Our shared hosting platform is also based on Debian as OS and many of the best
free software pieces: Postfix, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, proFTPD, PowerDNS.
</p>
<p>
The reason to use Debian is the fantastic quality it has in
terms of performance, stability, package management system and
services administration. We love the project and its philosophy.
