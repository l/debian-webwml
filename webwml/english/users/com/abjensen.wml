#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Using Debian as database server, web server and file server. In the
  factory more workstations are installed with Debian.
</p>
<p>
  The reason for choosing Debian, was the ease of use, the GPL policy, the 
  possibility to make a minimal installation and just the fact that it is 
  fantastic.
