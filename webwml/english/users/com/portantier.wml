#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian because it's simple, robust, secure, easy to install and it's 
    100 percent Free Software.
</p>

<p>
    We are information security consultants, and we need to provide security to 
    our customers, hence we chose Debian for critical servers, which run Apache, 
    Postfix, Bind, Zabbix, and other Free Software.  With more than seven years 
    of experience, we also offer Debian technical support and customization.
    In Debian we trust!
