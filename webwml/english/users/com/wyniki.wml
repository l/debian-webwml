#use wml::debian::users

<p>
	We are using Debian for the Apache web server, mysql database, ftp, 
	and advanced image recognition processing for lotto coupons for which 
	we use Imagemagick and own. 

	It runs on one 64bit Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620  station. 

	Debian was chosen because of stability and great support.
