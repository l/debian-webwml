<p>
  spotlight.de is a renowned German web community help site (at
  present the biggest one of this type) providing about 70 moderated
  discussion boards whose subjects are roughly centered at the
  interests and needs of day-to-day and hobbyist computer
  users. Presently, the site runs on a dedicated custom-built
  dual-pentium3/700/1GB RAM/2x18 GB SCSI RAID-1 server running
  Debian. This system choice was based on the known reliability,
  stability, flexibility, and updatability of the Debian
  distribution.

<p>
  Considering the approaches taken to various technical issues,
  spotlight.de differs quite dramatically from a typical LAMP setup,
  for example, some of the most distinguishing special features of
  this site on the technical level are based on custom-built Apache
  modules (written with mod_perl); hence, it is of vital importance
  for proper operation of spotlight.de to have timely updates
  available (especially if security related) which can be performed
  remotely and seamlessly during normal operation, which do not
  break the interplay between various even not-so-mainstream
  packages.
