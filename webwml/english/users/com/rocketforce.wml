#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have one production web, database, mail, dns and utility server that 
    currently runs Debian. We also have a development / file server and various 
    client servers that run Debian.

    Debian was the clear choice for multiple reasons. Having started off my 
    Linux background using Ubuntu, I wanted to use an OS that was similar but 
    more suited for servers. I have used Debian/Ubuntu as my sole Linux choice 
    for the past eight years. There are many reasons I continue using Debian, 
    such as the package manager, the ample support and its stability.
