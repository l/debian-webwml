<p>
    Parkyeri is a software development company from Turkey.  We develop our
    products using free software.
</p>

<p>
    All our servers run Debian GNU/Linux since 2001.  Building large scale
    projects, we heavily use PostgreSQL and MySQL.  Software we depend on for 
    our team-based work style (Subversion, GNU Enterprise, XMPP) run on 
    Debian servers as well.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian over other alternatives; because of its reliability and 
    ease of maintenance.
