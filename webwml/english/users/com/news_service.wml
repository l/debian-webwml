<p>
  We maintain a high traffic server farm of news servers. Currently we have
  over 10 different servers of which some easily process over 150 Mbps (250
  at peak times). In total all servers process hundreds of Mbps and 
  millions of articles a day. Our servers are in the top 150 of the top 
  1000 Usenet sites in the world.  We choose more and more Debian over 
  FreeBSD because Debian is easy to install, maintain and support. Best of 
  all, Debian is rock solid stable.  Getting 99.99+% uptime a month is no 
  exception.

  News-Service.com is part of a bigger access and hosting company. Most
  hosting and e-mail servers are running Debian and even most of the Support
  staff is running Debian on their desktops. Coming from a BSDI and FreeBSD
  background, Debian is a real enlightenment in terms of maintainability.
