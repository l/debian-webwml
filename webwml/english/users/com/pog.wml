<p>
    Osteopathical Center with 16 employees. We have one Debian server with 10 
    workstations (terminal clients) and two printers. We use Icedove with 
    lightning extension for our mails and calendars, a homemade GPL 
    python/tk script for our medical needs.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian for its stability, security and ease of maintenance. We 
    like Debian as it is totally free and open source, compared to other 
    Debian-based distributions. Thanks to all Debian developers!
