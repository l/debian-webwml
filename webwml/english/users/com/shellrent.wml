#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are a web hosting and domain registration company based in Vicenza, 
    Italy.  We chose Debian for all our hosting infrastructure systems.
</p>

<p>
    We have deployed Debian templates for all our virtual servers for our 
    customers, because it is easy to manage and quick to update.  Then Debian is 
    very fast to install, and all our technical staff can fix security problems 
    very quickly and easily.  All developers and system administrators working 
    in our company use Debian as desktop environment, too, for developing and 
    managing the IT infrastructure.
