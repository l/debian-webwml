<p>
We started using Debian on our production servers about half a year 
after starting business and we decided to stay with it 
because it proved to be more reliable and provide a better performance 
than the Ubuntu server we had before. 
</p>

<p>
Right now, we are using it on two different machines: 
one production VPS and one less powerful backup VPS 
which we use also for pruduction during maintenance windows on the main server.
