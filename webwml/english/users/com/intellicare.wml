#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  At IntelliCare, I am currently replacing my SuSE desktop (Network 
  Administration workstation) and our Gentoo IDS sensors with Debian. We 
  develop hardware &amp; software for hospitals, and we will use Debian for HA server 
  clusters as well as workstations (development is currently on Windows, but we 
  plan to migrate/cross-develop ASAP). The main reasons for choosing Debian are 
  that it is a free, open-source GNU system, and the wonderful support through 
  the world-wide accessible Newsgroups and mailing lists.

  At home, my wife &amp; I am of course using Debian as well.
