<p>
  We're developing products for building automation on our development
  workstations running "Debian sarge". There's also a server with a 
  MoinMoin-Wiki running "Debian sarge".
</p>
<p>    
  The high quality and stability with Debian is just great! The availability 
  of software updates and security bugfixes is outstanding. Another reason to 
  use Debian is the quantity of available software packages.
</p>
<p>
  We use many packages which are not available in other GNU/Linux 
  distributions (e.g. kdevelop3, mtd-tools, clamav, tsocks). With Debian we 
  can get every package we need, just by using apt-get with it's "super cow 
  power".
