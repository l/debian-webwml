#use wml::debian::users
    <p>We use Debian for most of our servers, our virtual servers, web servers, 
    and game servers all run Debian. We also use Debian on our workstations. In 
    total around 25 machines and growing.</p> 

    <p>The best thing about Debian is that it works and does not use too many 
    resources. Which is great for us as a hosting provider. We had tried other 
    Linux distributions, but found out that they used a lot more resources.</p>
