#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on all of our workstations, and also on our backup and file 
    servers. We mainly run the KiCad software suite for designing schematics and 
    printed circuit boards, and LibreOffice and XeTeX for other documents.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because we agree with its free/open source philosophy, but 
    also because of its stability and great package management system.
