#use wml::debian::users

<p>
   We use Debian in the conduct of day to day business, for bookkeeping with 
   GnuCash, presentations with Open Office, and conducting on-line research 
   with Iceweasel.  We use many of the Debian apps used for the display and 
   manipulation of PDF documents such as Evince, PDF Shuffler, PDFSam, pdftk, 
   tesseract, and hocr2pdf.  
</p>
<p>
   For image manipulation we use GThumb, The GIMP, and Open Office Draw. For 
   video work we use mencoder, Parole, and VLC, among other tools.  
</p>
<p>
   We currently have a desktop computer and two laptop computers that are 
   loaded with Debian Squeeze/Wheezy.  We chose Debian because we find it to be 
   more flexible than Windows for meeting our needs.  We also value Debian's 
   stability.
