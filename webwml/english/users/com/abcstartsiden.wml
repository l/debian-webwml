Debian is currently running all external, and some
internal servers, ranging from webservers, database,
to support systems like monitoring and reporting.
A total of 200 servers, both virtual and physical
running PostgreSQL, MySQL, Apache, nginx, lighttpd.

Debian gives us a stable platform, with a big software
repository and the tools to efficiently manage the platform.
