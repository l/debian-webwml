<p>
The Register website and infrastructure use a variety of open source products,
including Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL and Perl all running on Debian GNU/Linux.
As of this writing in Nov 2011, all of our public facing services along with
many of our internal and development machines are running Debian (or Debian
based distributions like Ubuntu) and we see nothing else that comes close to
the quality and utility of the Debian OS.
</p>
<p>
Debian provides a solid platform for our DNS, email (including a mailing 
list for Reg readers), the dynamic and static parts of our website and 
production toolchain, supporting millions of our readers each month.
</p>
<p>
We were
  particularly attracted by Debian's reliability, stability, and
  flexibility, but most of all by its unmatched support for remote
  administration: since the system administrators and the systems
  themselves are separated by several hundred kilometers, it's especially
  important that as many tasks as possible can be accomplished remotely.
  Apt makes remote package management and upgrading trivial, and the
  Debian organization's enlightened and rapid response to security
  vulnerabilities lets us sleep easy in our beds.
