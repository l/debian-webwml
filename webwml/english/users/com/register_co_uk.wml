  The Register's web site has been served by Apache running on Linux for
  some time.  When the hardware was changed in December 2002, we eagerly
  took the opportunity to switch to Debian GNU/Linux.  We were
  particularly attracted by Debian's reliability, stability, and
  flexibility, but most of all by its unmatched support for remote
  administration: since the system administrators and the systems
  themselves are separated by several hundred kilometers, it's especially
  important that as many tasks as possible can be accomplished remotely.
  Apt makes remote package management and upgrading trivial, and the
  Debian organization's enlightened and rapid response to security
  vulnerabilities lets us sleep easy in our beds.

  As of this writing in April 2004, The Reg has all five of its
  public-facing servers running Debian, and no intention of moving to
  anything else.  The Debian machines now provide services including DNS,
  email (including a mailing list for Reg readers), and the custom-built
  Perl content management system and its database, not to mention the
  public web site which regularly handles more than a million page
  impressions a day.
