#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We're an automation company located in the center of The Netherlands
  (Utrecht). We use Debian on 2 of our servers and have sold and placed
  about 20+ Debian based servers at different locations throughout The
  Netherlands. The good thing "They just won't hang!" Very stable, Debian
  provides fast security updates when needed and is easy to install,
  configure and maintain.
