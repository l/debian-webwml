<p>
     We use Debian inside a multiple GNU/Linux distribution environment. We 
     run Debian on our servers for qualification and testing process, automatic 
     deployment of system images and in our bibliographic database management 
     server (using Koha). One of our IT service workstation runs Debian as well.
</p>     
<p>
     We have chosen Debian for the simplicity and quickness of the installation 
     process, its ease of maintenance as well as the overall system stability 
     through time.
