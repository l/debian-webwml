    We rent apartments and we use our IT infrastructure to manage apartment 
    bookings and the accounting. We used one Windows 2003 SBS connected to five 
    Windows 2000 workstations until 2007. In mid 2007 there was a change in the 
    licensing policy of our former software, which was FoxPro-based. I looked 
    for alternatives. Having heard of Linux, I tested Ubuntu 7.04 on one 
    workstation for about six months. All workstations were migrated to Ubuntu 
    7.10 when it came out, and a final migration took place in spring 2008 when 
    Ubuntu 8.04 was adopted for all the IT infrastructure (both server and 
    workstations), as I finally found viable replacements for all the software 
    that we once used under Windows. However, I do not like the way that Ubuntu 
    has evolved after 10.04. Consequently all computers, that is, server and 
    workstations, have been migrated to Debian Squeeze on August 20th 2012.

    The choice was my sole responsibility. I chose Debian because it was the 
    sensible choice, as I was familiar with a Debian-based distribution and the 
    Debian <q>ecosystem</q>. Debian consistently provides stability and a good 
    level of resource efficiency.
