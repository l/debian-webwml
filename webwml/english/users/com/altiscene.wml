<p>
    We use Debian to power our file and groupware servers and our VPN server. 
    Debian is very reliable and we only restart the four Debian servers twice a 
    year after cleaning the hardware. We also have some Debian and Debian 
    derivatives workstations.

<p>
    Thanks to Debian we could optimize the cost of our infrastructure and 
    recycle old units to run as powerful servers with nice storage capacities or 
    second hand workstation. Our IT manager is a absolute fan of the Debian 
    system.
