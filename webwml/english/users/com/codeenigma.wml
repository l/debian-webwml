<p>
    We are a web solutions company specialising in FOSS and particularly Drupal 
    and Debian. We build solutions with Drupal, we host them with Debian. We 
    have over 50 servers under our control, all running <q>Wheezy</q>, we use it 
    for a whole range of purposes - monitoring nodes with Munin and Nagios, web 
    servers running Nginx and PHP-FPM, database servers running Percona and 
    MongoDB, CI with Jenkins, Apache Solr, Ruby products like Gitlab for VCS and 
    Redmine for ticketing, some developer workstations, lots of vagrant VMs for 
    development - every single server we run is Debian-backed, whether local 
    development, customer staging or live production.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because we prefer the community, we are more familiar with 
    its approach to package management and we're very impressed with the speed 
    of response to incidents like <q>Heartbleed</q> (the speed of response to 
    which was a credit to the Debian community).
