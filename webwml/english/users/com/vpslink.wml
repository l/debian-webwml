<p>
    VPSLink is virtual private server hosting provider.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is presently the most popular Linux operating system used on our 
    virtual private server hosting service. At any given time there are 
    thousands of virtual machines running Debian in our datacenter and we 
    couldn't be happier with Debian's track record for security and reliability
    (it makes managing everything that much easier).
