#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have up to 10 servers running customized <q>sid</q> for web development and 
  security purposes. We also use Debian in all firewall, NIDS and accounting 
  machines for our customers.
</p>
<p>
  Why Debian? Ease of use, reliability and it fits perfectly on low budgets.
