#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have about 30 servers running Debian for 800 
    workstations and for about 50,000 Internet users by day. The standard 
    configuration is used in Debian, running software as
qmail, djbdns, vsftpd, Apache and Tomcat. We develop
    applications and web services in that architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Debian means stability, easy configuration and a limited investment in 
    hardware. The latter is not the most important item, because we buy new 
    hardware for Debian, but some systems (even laptops) based on hardware 
    from the year 2000 run without problems. Performance is very important, 
    but it is not only a fix for Debian, it's also a fix for the software 
    you install on it.
</p>
<p>
We also use Debian because is an company-independent Linux distribution
which has a massive support community.
