#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have about 30 servers running Debian (Woody and Sarge) for 800 
    workstations and for about 50,000 Internet users by day. The standard 
    configuration is used in Debian, Apache and Tomcat. We develop 
    applications and web services in that architecture.
</p>
<p>
    Debian means stability, easy configuration and a limited investmest in 
    hardware. The latter is not the most important item, because we buy new 
    hardware for Debian, but some systems (even laptops) based on hardware 
    from the year 2000 run without problems. Performance is very important, 
    but it is not only a fix for Debian, it's also a fix for the software 
    you install on it.
