#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using the Debian operating system on more than 100 servers, for our 
    internal servers (homemade applications and virtualization), and also for 
    external web servers as our corporate website and our eLearning system, 
    <url "https://www.formation-cybersecurite.com/" />.  Debian is definitely 
    easy to upgrade and manage, it has lot of available packets. We like it :)

    As an IT security company, AKAOMA is considering security as a major 
    priority.  Having a huge and active community, Debian is thus the operating
    system we recommend to our customers.
