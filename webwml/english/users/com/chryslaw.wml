<p>
  Our firm is called CHRYSANTHOU &amp; PAPAGEORGHIOU based in Nicosia, Cyprus.
  We are a commercial law firm and have been using Debian for a year now, 
  having had this installed and maintained by our sysadmin G. Karaolides.
</p>
<p>
  We use Debian for file and print sharing, DHCP server, as an email server 
  and web server, and as a fax server (hylafax), using RAID 1. We have 11 
  workstations connected to the server. We have never had any crashes and 
  have chosen Debian over other Linux distributions mainly due to the ease 
  of remote administration.
