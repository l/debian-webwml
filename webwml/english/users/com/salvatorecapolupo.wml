#use wml::debian::users


<p>
We use Debian for developing applications for professional purposes, for 
testing various SEO applications, and for developing games with native IDE. We 
use PHP, MySQL, and prefer Apache over NGINX. We are also developing 
browser-games in Phaser using Eclipse and Netbeans.
</p>

<p>
we are running Debian on a netbook and on a PC. We have chosen it as the best 
and most clear secure Linux distribution in our experience.
