#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are running about 12 Debian servers, in the past we used different 
    distributions, but in the end we chose Debian for the stability and ease 
    of maintainance. Furthermore we are a strong believer in Free Software. 
</p>    
    
<p>
    We run: Xen, apache2, PHP, tomcat, samba. The servers are mainly Internet 
    servers for http and ftp. But a few are set up as NAS with samba and NFS.
