<p>
  Epigenomics is a transatlantic biotechnology company with headquarters
  in Berlin, Germany and its wholly owned subsidiary in Seattle,
  Washington, USA, pioneering tomorrow's personalized medicines.
  We are running Debian GNU/Linux on about 30 servers and 50
  workstations. The servers are doing common tasks like filesystems and
  mail, others have special tasks in our bioinformatics departments.
  Debian GNU/Linux was chosen because of its flexibility, stability and
  the superior packet management.
