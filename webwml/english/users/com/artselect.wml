<p>
  We use Debian and other open-source tools throughout all technical
  aspects of the company: clusters, workstations, remote order
  fulfillment relays, etc., and have since we began in early 1998.
  We chose Debian for stability, security, ease of administration,
  and updatability.
</p>
<p>
  We sell custom-framed art prints (currently US-only due to export
  headaches), and build customized framed-art sites for third parties.
