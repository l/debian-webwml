<p>
    Our beloved server, cupid, has two network interfaces for Internet and LAN. 
    We have used that server for about 5 years, since Debian <q>potato</q>.
    The server is the Internet connection for 13 Windows-based workstations
    and four notebooks.
</p>

<p>
    Installed packages include samba, php, apache2, mysql, postgresql, 
    postfix, clamav, amavis-ng, spamassasin, bind9, vsftpd, and tools like 
    iptables, mrtg, squid, sarg, mailman, etc.
</p>

<p>
    I chose Debian because of apt-get, and the better package management 
    compared to <kbd>make install</kbd> in BSD or yum/urpm for RPMs.
