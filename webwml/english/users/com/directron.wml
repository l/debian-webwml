#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use Debian GNU/Linux as a choice for fast stable servers and 
  workstations. Currently, our in-house DHCP, intranet, NAT, NIS, and even 
  NT Domain Authentication servers all run Debian.  Several of our employees 
  use Debian on the desktop, and we are currently migrating towards diskless
  workstations for many of our employees, again, based on Debian, talking to
  a Debian TFTP host.
