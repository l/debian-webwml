<p>
    We are using Debian for advanced cryptographic programs like ISAAC, and for 
    random number generators (RNG). What's more, it's used for simpler tasks 
    like apache web server, mysql database, and ftp. It's running on one 64 bit 
    Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620 station.

<p>
    Debian was chosen because of no vulnerabilities (malware &amp; hacks), and 
    great support.
