<p>
    ZSD has been using Debian since 1997. We are an Internet Service Provider 
    and we specialize in setting up and supporting on-site servers for small to 
    medium based clients. We provide remote and telephonic support for these 
    servers, our clients often have no Linux specific skills. These servers 
    provide firewalls (shorewall), dns (bind, power-dns), dhcp (isc-dhcp), 
    e-mail (exim, dovecot, roundcube), anti-virus/anti-spam (clamav, 
    spamassassin), vpn's (openvpn, racoon), proxies (squid, dansgaurdian, sarg), 
    webservices (apache, php, mysql), backups (rdiff-backup), raid storage 
    (Linux RAID1 software) and file services (samba). We use Debian on our 14 in 
    house servers and we have nearly 200 Debian servers under maintenance 
    contracts on client premises.

<p>
    Debian servers are very stable and they facilitate easy software upgrades, 
    including major upgrades, over remote links. Linux RAID software allows for 
    flexible hardware upgrades and easy recovery from hardware failures without 
    excessive downtime and no Linux specific skills on site.
