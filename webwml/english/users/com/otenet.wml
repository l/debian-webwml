<p>
  OTEnet Telecommunications is a corporate ISP headquartered in Nicosia, Cyprus.  Debian
  GNU/Linux is used as the server platform of choice for both customer
  and internal services, including web, mail, ftp, database, and
  fileservers.  Debian is also used for system and network monitoring,
  trouble ticket management, testing and development.
</p>
<p>
  Factors which influenced the choice of Debian included the quality,
  stability and wide range of the packages offered, the power and
  flexibility of the packaging system, the high availability of the
  software repositories and mirrors, the possibility of running Debian on
  multiple architectures, the active and knowledgeable community and the
  support it provides on the mailing lists, and especially, the fact that
  security updates are promptly released, of high quality, and easy to
  apply.
