<p>
    We use Debian GNU/Linux on all our servers, including web, mail, file 
    server, backup, and on routers where we run BGP, forward and firewall rules. 
    We are also hosting a Debian mirror and the debian.org.ro community.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of its stability, package management and 
    easy methods for services configuration and debugging.
