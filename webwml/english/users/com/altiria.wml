#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian on our production servers, running the PostgreSQL 
    database server, Tomcat and a SMS platform developed by ourselves.  We also 
    use it for company servers (SMTP, file and web servers).
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of stability, functionality, level of development,
    flexibility and adaptability. We have been using it since the Hamm release.
