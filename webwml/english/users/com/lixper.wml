#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Lixper adopt Debian on all servers for internal services (test machines, 
    development machines, VCS, DMS, CMS, web sites, groupware) and for services 
    offered to customers (document management systems, ERP applications, remote 
    backups and web sites). We also use Debian on half of our development 
    laptops. As of 2009-03-26, distribution used are Etch and Lenny on i386 and 
    amd64. Lixper invite and support its customers to use Debian systems when 
    its products are to be delivered at customer sites; so currently about 15 
    Italian customers adopted Debian too.
</p>

<p>
    Lixper chose Debian and GNU/Linux based on its commitment to the free 
    software community, on the stability of its packages, and, above all, 
    because of its timely security updates.
