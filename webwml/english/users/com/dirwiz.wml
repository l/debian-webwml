<p>
    Our entire company uses Debian on servers, desktops &amp; Raspberry PI(s), and 
    have been since 2001. It is now used in every aspect of our business and 
    hosts DNS, firewall, VPN, email, web, ftp, SMS gateway, printer servers, 
    backups and more.

    Debian was chosen originally for SPARC support but have since migrated to 
    x86_64.  It has proven to be one of the most stable platforms we have ever 
    run with almost no downtime.
