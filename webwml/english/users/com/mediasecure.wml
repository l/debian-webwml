#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Here at Mediasecure, we use Debian for our infrastructure and development 
    servers, totalling over 50 machines. We also recommend Debian to our 
    customers for most situations, although we also install other distributions 
    if they so desire. Our cloud infrastructure runs also on Debian. Our 
    technical engineers are available for our customers at all times, 24 hours 
    a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  We also offer technical support 
    for free for any customer who run Debian on their servers.
