#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Since our inception over five years ago DreamHost has used entirely Debian
  servers in our shared hosting operations. Although we initially chose it
  because of its ability to work on inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware and
  lack of licensing fees, we have continued to be impressed with its
  reliability, flexibility, security, and scalability as we've grown. We now
  have over 150 Debian servers serving 50,000 web sites and hundreds of
  thousands of email accounts and we've never been disappointed.  We are in
  the process of upgrading all our servers to "woody" and our system admins
  are pleased with how smoothly the transition is thanks to the well thought
  out design of all Debian releases. Our business would not be possible
  without Debian Linux!
