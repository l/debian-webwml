<p>
    GigaTux is a web and VPS hosting company with a primary focus on offering 
    the most stable platforms possible, based on free and open source 
    technologies.
</p>

<p>
    GigaTux's main focus is on Xen VPS servers and all of our Xen dom0 setups 
    run Debian for its combination of tried and tested stability and a reliable 
    upgrade path. When up to one hundred separate VPS domUs are running on each 
    physical server, so choosing the most dependable Linux distribution is of 
    paramount importance. We have found that nothing has beaten Debian since we 
    started using it from Debian 4.0.
</p>

<p>
    GigaTux always recommends Debian for each domU but we create many different 
    Linux distribution templates for the DTC hosting panel, always making these 
    available for free. Supplementing the OS reliability, we spend months 
    researching the most dependable locations for our Linux hosting servers 
    around the globe.
