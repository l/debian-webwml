<p>All our private web servers use the Debian distribution in different versions and variations.</p>

<p>We use SMTP, POP, DNS and FTP services which have worked continuously and steadily for several years, even on older machines.</p>

<p>We were looking for an open source system with large community support and easiness regarding installing programs from reliable repositories. Highly recommended.</p>
