<p>
ZETO is an organization creating applications for customers.
</p>
<p>
Our two webservers run Debian.

We also use Debian as router (on the stick).

About 20 Debian stable are installed as
virtual machines on our 4 Citrix XenServer.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of its great package management, sensible
  defaults, stability and great flexibility.
