#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We are an IT services company with focus on Linux and on Open Source 
  software. We use Debian GNU/Linux as the primary operating systems for 
  servers, workstations and laptops in our company and usually suggest it 
  to our customers for servers and workstations.  
</p>
<p>
  We prefer Debian over other Linux distribution for the easiness of 
  upgrade and maintenance, the prompt and reliable of security updates 
  and the amazing overall quality of the packages.
