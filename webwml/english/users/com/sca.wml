#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian to monitor the infrastructure of eight countries. We use 
    Nagios, Cacti and Ntop to make this work.  We run Debian on our servers and 
    run Kubuntu on some of our desktops.  We use and promote the use of Debian 
    and Open Source.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of stability, security, reliability and the 
    philosophy behind it - keep up the good work!
