#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian for our account administration.  We chose Debian because we
    like its philosophy and it is better than other Linux distributions.  The 
    program we usually emply are: Gnome, Knoda as front-end for Sqlite, Sqlite, 
    Python, Gedit, Quanta Plus, Iceweasel, Icedove.
