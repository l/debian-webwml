#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We use Debian on all of our servers and on the vast majority of our 
workstations, which are between 50 - 100 installations, including virtual 
hosts.
</p>
<p>
Our development servers are used both for embedded software development and 
for intensive testing of our and our customers products. Our infrastructure 
servers run non-vanilla versions of Apache with in-house patches, as well wiki,
 mail, VCS services, and etc...
</p>
<p>
The main reasons for choosing Debian were the simplicity of administration and 
stable releases.
