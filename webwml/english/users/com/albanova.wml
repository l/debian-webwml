#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use 2 Debian boxes for web programming in php, HTML and
  javascript with MySQL database access. We also use a Debian box
  for our local web, database and file server.
</p>
<p>
  When I started working here all they used was Microsoft Windows
  machines, after a few problems a coworker and I convinced the boss
  to use Linux. My coworker installed another brand of Linux, but
  after that also giving problems I installed Debian on all the
  Linux boxes.
</p>
<p>
  Why did I chose Debian?  It's my personal choice of Linux, it is
  stable, easy to administrate, and is not tied to commercial
  interests.
