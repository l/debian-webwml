  Binoculars.com has achieved triple digit percentage sales growth since 
  2001. This growth also brought heavy increase of traffic to their servers. 
  Unfortunately this traffic stressed their system to the point of failure 
  during the 2003 holiday season. After the holidays, the top Binoculars.com
  priority was fixing the instabilities in their technology. The result of 
  the focus of the entire tech staff was the creation of the technology they 
  call: Dynamically Generated HTML.
</p>
<p>
  Some web technology experts might view Binoculars.com's new method of 
  serving plain text HTML as a step backwards. However, the people at 
  Binoculars.com feel the benefits are worth the funny looks they sometimes 
  receive. A popular opinion in website technology is that cutting edge web 
  sites are entirely dynamically driven. Dynamically driven websites query a 
  database when a web page is requested which produces the content. 
  Binoculars.com found their dynamic site was a problem for their database as 
  the processing power necessary to manage the increasing traffic was 
  enormous. Therefore the company took radical action.
</p>
<p>
  First, the company severed the link to the database from their web server. 
  Second, they switched to open source technology, more specifically, the 
  Apache web server. "To say the least," says Joseph Warner, CIO, "the 
  results have been stunning. One of our main problems at Christmas was our 
  name brand SQL server consistently crashed." Warner continues, "With SQL 
  down, our entire site was down. Not a good thing for a company that does 
  99% of their business on the Internet." The other issue Binoculars.com 
  faced was slow processing of Active Server Pages for web content itself. 
  Data from Veritest, an organization commissioned by Microsoft, suggests 
  that static HTML running on Apache web server can serve over four times as 
  many concurrent users as Dynamic pages running on Microsoft's IIS. With a 
  few tweaks of Apache they are seeing over 10 times the serving ability.
</p>
<p>
  Binoculars.com still uses an SQL database, but only to store data. Then the 
  company uses code to make the HTML web pages from this data. The HTML pages 
  are finally pushed out to the web servers every five minutes. This keeps 
  the servers up to date while keeping the strain off SQL.
</p>
<p>
  Previously, Binoculars.com's server pairs (one server for web pages and the 
  other for the database) would max out at 20,000 visitors a day. Now a 
  single Apache server has hit traffic spikes of over 200,000 visitors. 
  Another benefit to the company's technology change is price. Last Christmas 
  serving costs were running $2500 per month. Now the company has more 
  servers and the ability to handle 90% more people in a day and the bill has 
  dropped to $1000 per month. This has allowed the company to locate multiple 
  servers throughout the United States. The use of multiple servers creates 
  redundancy and stability. If one server goes out, then pages are served from 
  other locations.
</p>

  CEO Daniel Thralow says, "Our old system crashed at least twice a week. Now 
  we have a structure in place that seems to rarely, if ever, go down. We 
  have been running on this new system for a month and customer complaints of 
  a slow or frozen site have gone to zero. We have also noticed an increase
  in new orders. This has been such a period of positive change, that we 
  brought in food and few cases of champagne for the entire staff to 
  celebrate."
</p>
<p>  
  We are using Debian for all our public webservers and a few backend local 
  servers as well. The stability with Debian is great and the package 
  management with apt make life easy. With the strong community that Debian 
  has built, support is also just a click away.
