#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Intelligent Applications Sweden AB use Debian on some of its application 
    servers, routers, test systems, and developer workstations.
</p>

<p>
    Software developed to run on the servers is packaged in Debian's native
    .DEB format and rolled out using APT. Typical software used in conjunction 
    with software developed in-house is: apache, freeradius, gcj, mysql, perl, 
    php, postgresql, tomcat, etc.
</p>

<p>
    Debian was chosen because of the overall quality of the distribution,
    in-house Debian competence, maintainability, the social contract, sane
    defaults, and last but not least the superior packaging system and the
    vast amount of pre-packaged software for it.
