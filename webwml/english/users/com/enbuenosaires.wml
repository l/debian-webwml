<p>
    We are a small property web site based in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
    currently with around 120,000 visitors a month, and serving around
    1,500,000 page views.

<p>    
    We use Debian on our production and development servers, for several 
    reasons:  It is extremely easy to install and maintain, the package 
    management is really straightforward.  The documentation likewise is 
    very good.  We're running apache 2.0, java tomcat 5.5.17, mysql 5.x, 
    qmail and it handles it beautifully
