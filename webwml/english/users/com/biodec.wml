<p>
    BioDec is an Italian company specialized in bioinformatics.  We run Debian 
    on almost all of our servers:  We use it for both infrastructure, like 
    e-mail, web services, firewall, etcetera, and for bioinformatics clusters 
    (which is one of our business).
</p>

<p>
    We have slightly less than 20 Debian servers (both virtualized and physical) 
    in our offices and manage less than a hundred of them (both virtualized and 
    physical) for some customers of ours.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian for the support from the Debian people, which is simply the 
    best around.  From time to time we complain about missing features and 
    strange quirks, but overall we chose Debian because it has the best 
    <q>hacker</q> team ever.  Go on Debian, and fly high!
