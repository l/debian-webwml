#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We run Debian on multiple VPS nodes, because Debian is reliable, fast and 
    secure. Makes system administration a breeze. Our customers are quite happy 
    with Debian along with apache, mysql and php for hosting their websites. 
    We've run Debian for several years and we couldn't be happier.
