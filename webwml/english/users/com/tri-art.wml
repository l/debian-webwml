#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Tri-Art uses Debian for all of its servers (gateway, database, and 
    fax/print) and for the majority of its users' desktops.  Debian is also used 
    for the company's integrated systems in the manufacturing process (dedicated 
    machines running custom software).  This comprises just over 20 machines 
    running Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of its package management, stability, and solid 
    releases.
