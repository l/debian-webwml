#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian etch on several hosts, with tasks like fileserving (samba), 
    webserving (LAMP) and e-mail (postfix, dovecot).
</p>

<p>
    Debian was our final choice because of its low system requirements, 
    stability, ease of usage and, last but not least, the price.  It's a fine 
    system to work with and fits our requirements in a server environment very 
    well.
