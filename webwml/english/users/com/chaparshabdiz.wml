#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We run Debian (Woody) on all our workstations (software development) and 
  servers. We use and promote the use of Debian in Iran vs. other 
  distributions and Windows. Our Shabdix (<url "http://shabdix.berlios.de/" />) 
  is based on KNOPPIX and so in turn based on Debian.
