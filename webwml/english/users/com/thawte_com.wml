<p>
  We run our web infrastructure on Debian woody - 12 servers including DR
  site. We also run 10 developer workstations on Debian. We've used Debian
  since 1997 or earlier (bo -&gt; hamm -&gt; slink -&gt; potato -&gt; woody...)
</p>
<p>
  Reasons we love Debian include the package management, security updates
  and the Free Software egalitarian philosophy.
