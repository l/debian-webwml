<p>
    Silverstorm runs the bulk of its production network and servers on Debian 
    GNU/Linux. It does this for three primary reasons: Stability, 
    upgrade-ability, and community support.  These three things combine to 
    create a better ROI than any other Operating System for our business.
</p>
<p>
    SilverStorm designs and manufactures InfiniBand Switches and HCAs enabling 
    20Gb/s, extremely low latency interconnections for massively parallel 
    supercomuting clusters of commodity machines.

<p>
    I have tried virtually every distribution of Linux, and always come back 
    to Debian GNU/Linux. It is simply the best.
