#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on two fronts: The first is in our 14 web application servers 
    (Dev and Live).  So everything from websites to our CRM/ERP system.  The 
    second area we use it is on our Asterisk PBX servers which we've currently 
    got four of across the country all managing 50-200 peers each over VoIP and 
    ISDN.

<p>
    Debian's been great for the company - reliable, clean, simple and it 
    just works!
