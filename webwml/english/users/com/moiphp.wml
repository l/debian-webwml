#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian to develop new sites with php, html5, and javascript for our 
    clients. All of our sites are tested in Linux infrastructure. 

    We have 11 dedicated servers and 4 virtual servers working under Debian which 
    provide hosting for sites, infrastructure for developers, and jabber, DNS, FTP
    and VoIP services.

    We also have 10 workstations which run Debian for office use.

    We choose Debian as our main OS because it's a stable and easy to support 
    system.
