#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    A significant part of our SME backbone infrastructure runs on Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian as our preferred option after considerable experience with 
    Red Hat, SuSE, and Slackware.  All of these have their good points but we 
    prefer Debian for its package management system, its security management, 
    its strict adherence to policies, and its relatively slow upgrade cycle. 
    Debian is solid. We are running as a dual-boot on  workstations, too.
