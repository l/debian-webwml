#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have two servers: A Samba domain controller running Debian etch to manage 
    six desktop Windows machines and two laptops. This server shares two laser 
    printers. The server runs a incremental (daily) and full backup (every 
    Saturday). The other server runs a shared ADSL connection, where it acts as 
    firewall, DNS, and DHCP server.
</p>

<p>
    We use Debian in Bm2i's network because of its stability and security, and a 
    good secured remote administration. In fact the administrator doesn't work 
    at the business premises.
