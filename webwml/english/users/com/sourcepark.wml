#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  SourcePark develops platform independent information logistic
  systems.  We migrated a total of 1 office and 6 software
  development workstations from Windows 2000 to Debian 3.0
  woody/sarge/sid.
</p>
<p>
  We choose Debian for its stability, network capabilities and easy
  over the net installation.
