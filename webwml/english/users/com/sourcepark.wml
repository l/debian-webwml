<p>
  SOURCEPARK develops platform independent information logistic
  systems.
</p>
<p>
We have 15 servers, 6 self made Debian-based
appliances and more than 20 workstations.
We run LibreOffice, GIMP, Inkscape, NetBeans, Spyder, Maven,
Pidgin, Iceweasel, Icedove and a lot of other applications.
</p>
<p>
We choose Debian because it's the most stable, most attractive,
most usable, most reliable and most scalable OS available.
