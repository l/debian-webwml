<p>
    We run a mix of Debian and Ubuntu servers for all of our high
    frequency, quantitative trading and development. Our installation
    contains roughly 100 servers and tens of terabytes of storage in several
    geographically dispersed locations. Athena's computing infrastructure is
    constantly growing.

<p>
    We picked Debian for its stability, package management, large user base,
    and commitment to Free Software.
