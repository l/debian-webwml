<p>
  Hostsharing is a fast-growing ISP based on open source software and
  applies open source principles to Internet hosting services.  Organized as
  a cooperative of website owners and Internet specialists, we offer not
  only the whole range of Internet hosting services, but enable a maximum of
  member participation.
</p>
<p>
  Debian GNU/Linux is the platform of choice for most of our growing number
  of Internet servers to provide web, mail and other Internet services to
  our members.  The Debian packaging system is perfect for remotely
  administered systems: shell-based, robust, transparent, slim and
  well-tested.  Additionally the Debian security support is fast and
  reliable.  And last but not least, we fully support Debian's Social
  Contract.
</p>
<p>
  Seeing Debian at work has convinced several of our members to use Debian
  GNU/Linux on their workstations and laptops.  Some of our members are also
  involved in the development of open source projects, including Debian
  itself.
