#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We're using Debian as a small provider. Actually we're using four webservers
    &mdash; two of them run Debian etch, another one runs Debian sarge and the oldest 
    still runs SUSE &mdash; this will be changed to Debian in the near future.
</p>

<p>
    Our department also runs a local network server and a testing environment on 
    Debian sarge. The testing server is running on a 450 MHz machine and it's 
    working great and fast! Our reason for using Debian is the perfect support, 
    stability, performance and great package management.
