    Debian is used on very specialized equipment that is loaded on planes to 
    gather testing data. There is other uses of Debian also. Most of the 
    installations I have encountered run Debian 3.1. About 30 machines that I 
    know of.

    Debian was chosen due to support of Power PC chips and the free nature of 
    Debian. Debian was not really chosen over the competition, as other 
    platforms are in use also, including Red Hat, Yellow Dog, CentOS, Fedora, 
    Ubuntu.
