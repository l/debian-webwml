#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Since the inception MrHostman (formerly BB-Hosting) has used only Debian 
    servers in its hosting operations. We chose Debian because of its ability to
    work on inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware and lack of licensing fees, we
    have continued to be impressed with its reliability, flexibility, 
    scalability and last but not least security! 
</p>

<p>
    We now have three Debian servers serving hundreds of web sites and e-mail 
    accounts and we've never been disappointed.
    The system administrator is pleased with how 
    smoothly the transition is thanks to the well thought out design of all 
    Debian releases. Debian Linux and its package system is a class of its own!
