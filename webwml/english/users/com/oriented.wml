<p>
    oriented.net is a Linux based web hosting and server company located in 
    Basel, Switzerland.  It provides a wide range of web hosting services such 
    as LAMP, Apache Tomcat, Java/J2SE as well as dedicated servers or virtual 
    private servers.  Furthermore oriented.net is the specialist for Java web 
    app hosting, especially Java CMS like Magnolia CMS or Day Communiqué.

    We are proud to say that we use Debian/GNU Linux on more than 90 percent of 
    our servers and this simply because of its stability, security and great 
    packaging system.  High availability and security are critical for us and 
    our customers since we can't afford a single minute of downtime due to an 
    unstable system.  As such it is not uncommon for us to have Debian servers 
    with more than 1200 days of uptime.

    But that's not all, when a new customer orders a dedicated server we also 
    highly recommend them to chose Debian as their operating system and we can 
    say that we are quite good at that, with only 10 percent of servers running 
    another Linux distribution or UNIX variant.  Of course our dedicated 
    customers are all satisfied with this excellent choice as we at 
    oriented.net are.  A big thank you to the whole Debian Team for all of the 
    great work, and keep on going!
