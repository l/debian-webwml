#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have a small circle of workstations (5) that we use Debian to test 
    branded remote support, and backup utilities for use in a production 
    environment.
</p>

<p>
    Debian is the distribution of choice due to its compatibility and 
    percentage of use by our clients.
