<p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux on more than 50 servers. They provide a wide 
    range of tasks:  Internet sharing, video registration, terminal access, file
    sharing, virtualization, document workflow, backup of private or important
    data and many others. Debian's amazing flexibility makes it possible to 
    apply it everywhere we want.
