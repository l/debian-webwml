#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We have three servers running Debian Stable. Two are Xen Dom0s containing 
    virtual Debian systems used for hosting (web, database, mail servers) and 
    one backup server running bacula.
</p>

<p>
    Debian GNU/Linux is used for both ethical and technical reasons: We 
    appreciate its stability and the support provided by the community. We are 
    proud to say that our servers are Debian powered!
