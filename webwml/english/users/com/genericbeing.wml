#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We currently use Debian on our server for http (https), ftp, ssh, and our 
  mail system. We also have 1 workstation using Debian "sarge", soon the 
  others (2) will migrate also.
</p>
<p>
  We believe all software should be as well prepared as Debian is. Stability, 
  reliability, flexibility and liberty are terms that come to mind when a 
  description of Debian is asked for.
