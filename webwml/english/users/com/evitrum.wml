#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We are using Debian on four servers for now, ERP (OpenERP), DDBB 
    (Postgresql), ERP web server (eTiny) and file server and backup tasks. At 
    the moment we are using etch, but we now are testing lenny migration using 
    virtual servers.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian GNU/Linux due to two mainly reasons, its great stability and
    its independence from market manipulations.
