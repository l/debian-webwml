    We are using Debian on our servers (3 of them) and increasingly on
    workstations (about 15 to date). Debian also powers our cluster of about 40 
    nodes. Our reasons are mainly security and ease of administration, but 
    stability is also an important factor -- and we run testing on most 
    machines without negative experiences. The other main factor is the strong 
    Debian support available everywhere. Thanks, Debian!

  <p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux to run a little server for the
    department, with internal web pages and shared home
    directories. The services are to be competitive with the
    university's own server, which runs a text-only HP-UX without any
    of the modern instruments and applications (no TeX, old (2.0)
    navigator, poor termcap support, very poor technical support, no
    modern shell), so we decided to run our own server. Also the
    server controls the two departmental printers, serving a lpd and a
    cups queue.
  </p>
  <p>
    We choose Linux to grant multiuser and desk-independent access to
    the users, easier configurability and updating, and totally
    cost-free solution, and in particular Debian for the extreme
    stability and availability. Moreover, our cousin department is
    serving a stable ftp distribution, so it was also a matter of
    bandwidth.

  <p>
    At Bond Uni we're using Debian to teach students unix system
    administration and security, as well as for about 10 servers
    (mostly research-related boxes). Debian is just the best
    distribution for maintaining servers.

  <p>
    We run a handful of workstations on a slightly customized woody (e.g. 
    2.4.20-openMosix-kernel). These machines mainly do very I/O- and 
    CPU-intensive image-processing using SPM and Matlab. Another server does FTP 
    and SSH-accounting, as well as serving as NFS-repository.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian because we were in need of a really stable base for our 
    research where even a small project takes an enormous amount of time and 
    nerves, and of course because the ease of updating packages, security issues 
    and the feeling of reliability and concept I got over the years using Debian 
    personally.

    Debian is our primary *nix platform, with over 300 desktops and server
    machines on our department network.  Previously a Sun shop, we still
    have some Suns and we also support Red Hat Linux and Windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian for several reasons, among them:  easy upgrades, the large
    number of packages, well-thought-out package defaults, and stability.

<userdetail "Calgary" "Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Canada" "http://phas.ucalgary.ca/">
  <p>
    Physics and Astronomy runs Debian on the main departmental server. 
    There are workstations and servers throughout the department that run on
    Debian which are used by faculty, staff and grad students.  In the
    science theaters, a lab of twenty+ Debian workstations is open for all
    physics students to use with a central Debian lab server. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We find Debian as reliable and as easy to use than the previous SGI Irix
    machines and the Sun Sparc machines.  Some of the Sparc's have been
    converted to Debian OS.  We still do computational work with SGI
    and Sun's but hope in the future to have a Debian cluster up and running
    (funding permitting).

    Using Debian to provide authentication and file and print serving via NFS,
    NIS, CUPS and Samba to ~100 desktop, laptop, workstation and data-taking
    machines in a research group studying aspects of semiconductor devices,
    particularly at low temperatures. A backup server performs rsync-based
    'snapshot' backups and writes tapes for archive purposes. This combination
    has recently survived the complete failure of our 0.5TB RAID system with a
    loss of only about 16 hours' data. Our 'user' machines run, in approximate
    order of descending number, Windows, RiscOS, Linux (Debian, Red Hat,
    Mandrake), MacOS, HP Unix. For a cash-limited research group, the free
    software route is an obvious choice. Debian ties in well with our existing
    expertise (the main administrator of the server has been running Debian
    since 0.93) and is supported by the University Unix Support team.

    Using Debian to provide the College's web server and have been since 1995.
    Despite temperatures in the non-airconditioned room taking an average of
    18 months to destroy the web server, Debian has provided the tools
    necessary to recover data from the (almost) trashed discs several times.
    At the time of first installing, the Debian machine replaced a Windows 3.1
    web server - which had to be taken off-line in order to update the site.
    Clearly a great step up.

    We use Debian Woody (kernel 2.4.18) to "hold" our link to
    Internet, using radio frequency, pcmcia modules an so on. We use

    In this department we have 130 computers, Debian GNU/Linux 3.0r1 is
    installed on 110 of those computers, accounting for the necessities of the
    department.
  </p>
  <p>
    The primary reason to choose Debian was the amount of packages it has, which
    cover most of the necessities of the technical jobs in our department.  We
    use software like KDE, Kylix Open Edition, TCL, Anjuta, Glade, Python, Java,
    Apache, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Samba and PHP.  Also Mozilla, GAIM, GnomeMeeting,
    OpenOffice.org, AbiWord, LyX, Scribus, Gnumeric and GnuCash.

  <p>
    At a national level, our institution provides education to all the layers of
    the society, and that's why we support the free software projects that
    permit us to invest in equipment, infrastructure, research, etc., instead of
    wasting money in expensive licenses of proprietary software.

  <p>
    Some members of our department started using Debian in 1997 and after a
    few years of experience, Debian became the official operating system of
    the department. Today, the majority of our computers run on Debian,
    performing tasks as serving web pages, electronic mail, webmail, and other
    more sophisticated tasks related to research. Even the department's 
    secretary works on a Debian machine, doing all the administrative work 
    secretaries do.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have a computer lab with a dozen computers where students, starting
    freshman year, receive their e-mail, browse the web, write reports and
    develop software to solve their physics home work. We also installed a
    parallel cluster of 20 computers using Debian and Mosix. The cluster is
    continuously run by our scientists to solve complex physics problems. Due
    to all this experience, and the need to update the systems continuously,
    the department assigned resources to maintain a Debian mirror, which later
    became the official Debian mirror of Chile.

    Debian powers our old Sun mailserver that otherwise would be unusable, and
    keeps an old Powerbook going.  As far as I know no other Free OS's current
    release supports this Sun hardware (Sparc 10 with dual Ross Hypersparc 
    CPUs), and NetBSD is the only other possible option for the "oldworld" G3 
    Powerbook.
  </p>
  <p>
    I originally chose Debian on i386 for its stability and security, but it's
    just as much the great support for non-PC hardware that matters to us now.

# From: Clement Moyroud <moyroudc@esiee.fr>
<userdetail "ESIEE" "ESIEE Engineering School, Paris, France" "http://www.esiee.fr/eng/">
  <p>
    ESIEE has been introducing Linux for the past few years in its IT
    infrastructure, on several levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first part is the migration from HP/UX workstation used for
    application-specific tasks - such as electronic design tools and
    mathematics software - to standardized PCs running Linux. At the
    moment, 75% of the workstations have been replaced. The last 25%
    will be replaced once the electronic CAD software vendors will
    have ported their applications to Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second part is the introduction of Debian as a dual-boot
    system on the students-accessible computers. The goal of the
    introduction of Linux is to bring more flexibility for the
    planning of lessons, as Linux can replace both HP/UX workstations
    for scientific tasks and Windows computers for Internet access and
    office work.  The third part is the migration of servers from
    HP/UX, Banyan Vines and Windows NT to Debian-based Linux
    systems. The switch was accelerated when it was decided to replace
    the aging Banyan solution with a LDAP/Samba account system on the
    Windows computers that are accessible to the students and the
    staff of the school.  The long term objective is to replace as
    much Windows computers as possible, even for the administrative
    personnel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian was chosen for its ease of administration and installation
    through the use of .debs and FAI, allowing installation of labs of
    12 computers within 20 minutes without the need for a CD or a
    floppy and without any user interaction. The creation of packages
    from vendor binaries enables an easy, consistent and fast way for
    installing the same software across around 200 computers used for
    scientific tasks.

    Debian is more stable than other Linux distributions.  Debian provides
    easy migration from older to newer versions using the simple dselect tool,
    after having edited the apt-get list. We have one server since 3 years

    We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
    developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
    was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
    easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
    underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
    Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
    policies. These are two important points in an educational
    environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
    Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
    of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
    then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
    choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a
    means to bring people to change their mind about free software and
    software development in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    The INSIA has about 300 students this year (i.e. on September, 2002). We have 
    150 brand new Intel-based workstations, running Debian/stable + some 
    self-packaged pieces of software such as XFree86, which we need because i845 
    video chipset are not supported in XF4.1. We also have 10 servers running 
    various services, such as Apache web server, Postfix mail server, etc...

    When it came to provide the common Internet services to the school, the

    workstation side, and of 1 mail server (exim, cyrus-IMAPd and 
    squirrelMail), one web server (apache), one DNS server (bind9), one file 
    server (netatalk) and one proxy server (Squid + squidGuard), on the 
    server side.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the school is noway in the position to hire a full-time IT admin, all

    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest

    well as upgrades, all non-interactive. Several servers (e.g.
    mail, a compute server) are also handled this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian years ago, because we have the full possibility to
    change everything to our needs and because it is relatively easy

    We have no assigned systems administrator, so it was very important that

    Since 2000, the-One-True-Linux (Debian GNU/Linux) has been the
    facto standard distro for network (web, mail, proxy, printer,
    file) servers at the UILA campus. It is widely used at the
    Computer Service Office (UPT Komputer), the Faculty of Computer
    Science, the Faculty of Science, as well as the Faculty of
    Engineering.  UILA is also proudly hosting mirrors such like

    We have selected the Debian distro because of its easiness to be

    The other distributions I've tried always have been disorganized and a

  <p>
    Before Debian was adopted, the Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) used
    several different Linux distributions: one for servers, another for
    touchscreens, another for itaniums, another for desktops, etc, and the
    use of Linux was not widespread.  Each of these other distributions
    were capable in their niche, but had limitations which did not allow
    them to be used in other capacities.  As the use of Linux at the GSC
    grew, it became burdensome to maintain all these different
    distributions.  We decided to standardize on Debian GNU/Linux, since
    it is the only distribution that gives of the power and flexibility we
    need to cover all these different machine requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian GNU/Linux was first deployed at the GSC as a desktop
    workstation operating system and now is running on roughly 50
    workstations.  More importantly, our whole data tracking system is run
    on about 80 Debian GNU/Linux machines with touchscreen monitors and
    barcode scan guns.  Once Debian proved its mettle on the desktop and
    data tracking arenas, it was used when we replaced our web servers,
    ftp server, and mail server, greatly reducing the total cost of
    replacement.

  <p>
    Binoculars.com has achieved triple digit percentage sales growth since 
    2001. This growth also brought heavy increase of traffic to their servers. 
    Unfortunately this traffic stressed their system to the point of failure 
    during the 2003 holiday season. After the holidays, the top Binoculars.com
    priority was fixing the instabilities in their technology. The result of 
    the focus of the entire tech staff was the creation of the technology they 
    call: Dynamically Generated HTML.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some web technology experts might view Binoculars.com's new method of 
    serving plain text HTML as a step backwards. However, the people at 
    Binoculars.com feel the benefits are worth the funny looks they sometimes 
    receive. A popular opinion in website technology is that cutting edge web 
    sites are entirely dynamically driven. Dynamically driven websites query a 
    database when a web page is requested which produces the content. 
    Binoculars.com found their dynamic site was a problem for their database as 
    the processing power necessary to manage the increasing traffic was 
    enormous. Therefore the company took radical action.
  </p>
  <p>
    First, the company severed the link to the database from their web server. 
    Second, they switched to open source technology, more specifically, the 
    Apache web server. "To say the least," says Joseph Warner, CIO, "the 
    results have been stunning. One of our main problems at Christmas was our 
    name brand SQL server consistently crashed." Warner continues, "With SQL 
    down, our entire site was down. Not a good thing for a company that does 
    99% of their business on the Internet." The other issue Binoculars.com 
    faced was slow processing of Active Server Pages for web content itself. 
    Data from Veritest, an organization commissioned by Microsoft, suggests 
    that static HTML running on Apache web server can serve over four times as 
    many concurrent users as Dynamic pages running on Microsoft's IIS. With a 
    few tweaks of Apache they are seeing over 10 times the serving ability.
  </p>
  <p>
    Binoculars.com still uses an SQL database, but only to store data. Then the 
    company uses code to make the HTML web pages from this data. The HTML pages 
    are finally pushed out to the web servers every five minutes. This keeps 
    the servers up to date while keeping the strain off SQL.
  </p>
  <p>
    Previously, Binoculars.com's server pairs (one server for web pages and the 
    other for the database) would max out at 20,000 visitors a day. Now a 
    single Apache server has hit traffic spikes of over 200,000 visitors. 
    Another benefit to the company's technology change is price. Last Christmas 
    serving costs were running $2500 per month. Now the company has more 
    servers and the ability to handle 90% more people in a day and the bill has 
    dropped to $1000 per month. This has allowed the company to locate multiple 
    servers throughout the United States. The use of multiple servers creates 
    redundancy and stability. If one server goes out, then pages are served from 
    other locations.
  </p>
  <p>
    CEO Daniel Thralow says, "Our old system crashed at least twice a week. Now 
    we have a structure in place that seems to rarely, if ever, go down. We 
    have been running on this new system for a month and customer complaints of 
    a slow or frozen site have gone to zero. We have also noticed an increase
    in new orders. This has been such a period of positive change, that we 
    brought in food and few cases of champagne for the entire staff to 
    celebrate."
  </p>
  <p>  
    We are using Debian for all our public webservers and a few backend local 
    servers as well. The stability with Debian is great and the package 
    management with apt make life easy. With the strong community that Debian 
    has built, support is also just a click away.

    Since our inception over five years ago DreamHost has used entirely Debian
    servers in our shared hosting operations. Although we initially chose it
    because of its ability to work on inexpensive off-the-shelf hardware and
    lack of licensing fees, we have continued to be impressed with its
    reliability, flexibility, security, and scalability as we've grown. We now
    have over 150 Debian servers serving 50,000 web sites and hundreds of
    thousands of email accounts and we've never been disappointed.  We are in
    the process of upgrading all our servers to "woody" and our system admins
    are pleased with how smoothly the transition is thanks to the well thought
    out design of all Debian releases. Our business would not be possible
    without Debian Linux!

    GNU/Linux SPARC servers hosting the LDAP, Kerberos and
    DNSSEC services for my network.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the Intel, the users authenticate/authorize against the
    LDAP/Kerberos setup (no users in traditional /etc/{passwd,shadow}
    etc). Using AFS (OpenAFS) for distributed storage of webdirectories,
    homedirectories etc guaranties availability and security
    of file services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can now (if need be) have access to their homedirectory
    at home securely through this encrypted network filesystem.

    Brooklyn Botanic Garden is a public garden and research institution.  We
    use x86-based Debian servers to host databases, file shares, and our
    corporate intranet applications as well as to provide infrastructure
    services such as mail relay, web proxy, and NAT.  We also use x86 and
    PowerPC-based Debian desktops in our IT Group and in our user training
    lab.
  </p>
  <p>
    We choose Debian GNU/Linux because of the Debian Social Contract, great
    package management, sensible defaults, stability, and the Debian
    community.

  <p>
    The Brant FreeNet is a non-profit Internet service provider. We use Debian 
    as our primary and secondary mailserver. We switched to Debian when our mail 
    server vendor upgraded their product and changed their pricing scheme to a 
    user-based charge that would not allow us to have the flexibility that we 
    need to manage our business.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the learning curve has been steep, we have managed to get our systems 
    fully integrated into a Win2k3 environment and the reliability of the system 
    has improved dramatically. Exim, Courier, and MailMan software have replaced 
    an expensive commercial package and performance has been enhanced. Certainly 
    our mail technical support to our end users has decreased dramatically.

  <p>
    CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
    used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris
    systems, .deb is used as the preferred package format, the whole
    GNU tool set is packaged, and in fact switching to entirely free
    operating systems like GNU/Linux is perfectly allowed and welcomed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
    and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
    running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
    users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
    Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
    packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
    to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
    deploy even more Debian servers in the future.

    CIPSGA is a non-governmental (non-profit) organization which works

    existence, we have given tens of speeches, and supported the use
    of GNU software inside these businesses. Thanks to our work, we
    expect to have more than 25 thousand machines running Debian
    GNU/Linux in the next 12 months (servers and workstations.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides that, CIPSGA has placed 2 of the 8 Brazilian Debian
    Developers, which now work in statal companies supporting Debian
    GNU/Linux. We created a customization of Debian Woody meant to be
    used in schools, unions and other organizations. It consists of an
    application server with a semi-automated install procedure which
    requires only 4 simple steps to complete. We are creating a
    Debian-friendly scenario in Brazil, which is very likely to spread

    being created to aid in the democratization of Internet access.
