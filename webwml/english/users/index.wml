    In the MIT AI lab the "Officially Supported" flavor of GNU/Linux
    is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
    Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
    compute cycles (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
    reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
    here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
    semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
    system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
    problems).

    At this public school, Debian is used on a small number of

    home directories, DNS, etc.  Debian is used by the students
    primarily for programming and computer graphics classes, extensive
    use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
    boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
    problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
    keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
    desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the
    simplest form possible for the student-run network.  MSNRSTHS is a

    Within Bioinformatics, all the machines, both servers and

    centralised on using Debian on all their hosts. Reasons for this

    range of hardware - of different architectures, and of differing
    age.  This single fact vastly simplifies administration, and makes
    it easier to centralise many tasks. The quality control and

    CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
    used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris

    In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
    and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
    running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
    users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
    Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
    packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
    to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
    deploy even more Debian servers in the future.

    We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
    developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
    was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
    easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
    underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
    Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
    policies. These are two important points in an educational
    environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
    Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
    of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
    then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
    choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a

    We currently use Debian on two servers, providing webmail, DNS,
    network monitoring, fax services, numerous internal web
    applications (CRM, Helpdesk, etc.) and other core network
    services. We are planning on more Debian installations in the
    future as we migrate services from WinNT to GNU/Linux.  We chose
    Debian because of the ease of maintenance (nothing beats
    apt-get!), and the biggest reason of all, stability.

    Debian currently runs on the main webserver (cthulhu.gdc.wpi.edu -
    Dual Pentium Pro), and the main login server, which handles mail
    as well (lovecraft.gdc.wpi.edu - Alpha DS-10 - currently down due
    to hard drive failure). It is being considered for the three new
    servers that are planned for deployment in the next month.

  <p>
    I'm no longer the organization's sysadmin (I graduated) - however,
    I chose Debian for the systems I had control of because of my
    familiarity (using Debian since 0.96R2 - former maintainer of
    apsfilter and abuse), and because of the high security by default
    - as well as the application support, and hardware support for the
    Alpha.

    The Economics Department runs Debian on all its servers (there are
    four main ones), on five workstation-servers that are used by
    graduate students, and on over 20 workstations in almost all
    graduate student offices. It is also used by several faculty
    members, although a few others use Red Hat and most use other
    operating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In large part, we use Debian for historical reasons. When we first
    started to use Linux, our local expert was a visiting graduate
    student who was (and is) a Debian developer. We continue to use it
    primarily because of the ease of upgrading and the efforts of the
    Debian security team.

    We power our linux workstations, notebooks and servers (a total of
    130 at the moment, growing fast) with an self-made
    autoinstallation of Debian (just converting to woody, we plan to
    publish it when it is ready). Our conf-update package handles the
    initial installation and hardware detection and configuration as
    well as upgrades, all non-interactive. Several servers (e.g.
    mail, a compute server) are also handled this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian years ago, because we have the full possibility to
    change everything to our needs and because it is relatively easy
    to do upgrades (security,...). The well tested state of each
    release gives us a reassuring stable base to build our additions
    and upgrades (e.g for new hardware) on.

    Since 2000, the-One-True-Linux (Debian GNU/Linux) has been the
    facto standard distro for network (web, mail, proxy, printer,
    file) servers at the UILA campus. It is widely used at the
    Computer Service Office (UPT Komputer), the Faculty of Computer
    Science, the Faculty of Sciene, as well as the Faculty of
    Engineering.  UILA is also proudly hosting mirrors such like

    We have selected the Debian distro because of its easiness to be

    spotlight.de is a renowned German web community help site (at
    present the biggest one of this type) providing about 70 moderated
    discussion boards whose subjects are roughly centered at the
    interests and needs of day-to-day and hobbyist computer
    users. Presently, the site runs on a dedicated custom-built
    dual-pentium3/700/1GB RAM/2x18 GB SCSI RAID-1 server running
    Debian. This system choice was based on the known reliability,
    stability, flexibility, and updateability of the Debian
    distribution.
  </p>
  <p>
    Considering the approaches taken to various technical issues,
    spotlight.de differs quite dramatically from a typical LAMP setup,
    for example, some of the most distinguishing special features of
    this site on the technical level are based on custom-built Apache
    modules (written with mod_perl); hence, it is of vital importance
    for proper operation of spotlight.de to have timely updates
    available (especially if security related) which can be performed
    remotely and seamlessly during normal operation, which do not
    break the interplay between various even not-so-mainstream
    packages.

    Physics and Astronomy runs Debian on the main departmental server. 
    There are workstations and servers throughout the department that run on
    Debian which are used by faculty, staff and grad students.  In the

    We find Debian as reliable and as easy to use than the previous SGI Irix
    machines and the Sun Sparc machines.  Some of the Sparc's have been

    and Sun's but hope in the future to have a Debian cluster up and running
    (funding permitting).

    Our virtual community, which has been in operation since 1996, now
    runs on a Debian GNU/Linux server (replacing what was originally a
    Sun Enterprise server, then a slew of Windows NT Server boxes).
    Debian has been my favorite distro for some time now, and its ease
    of performing system updates combined with its ease of
    customization and its overall stability made it a natural choice
    for our community-purchased server.  The server runs our Web

    At the CS Department of Montana Tech, we run Debian 3.0 on our two main
    department servers (one's the nfs server, the other's the main server
    people use for interactive off-campus logins), and on 11 other hosts
    set up as a general-purpose lab used by roughly 60 students of three of
    our courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have no assigned systems administrator, so it was very important that
    our systems run with a minimum of fuss, day in and day out.  Debian 3.0
    has lived up to this challenge:  the students use our servers for
    networking assignments, C and C++ programming, and the systems have
    been trouble-free.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian's package system (we usually just access it via dselect) is
    a big win.  Security updates are hassle-free, and our systems meet
    our current needs quite comfortably.  I've used a variety of
    commercial Unixes, and Debian's packaging system and reliability
    beats them all, hands-down.  (For what it's worth, I've been a
    full-time systems administrator in both academic and industry
    settings, so my experience with commercial systems has been both
    prolonged and painful...)
