    Physics and Astronomy runs Debian on the main departmental server. 
    There are workstations and servers throughout the department that run on
    Debian which are used by faculty, staff and grad students.  In the
    science theaters, a lab of twenty+ Debian workstations is open for all
    physics students to use with a central Debian lab server. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We find Debian as reliable and as easy to use than the previous SGI Irix
    machines and the Sun Sparc machines.  Some of the Sparc's have been
    converted to Debian OS.  We still do computational work with SGI
    and Sun's but hope in the future to have a Debian cluster up and running
    (funding permitting).

    We use Debian Woody (kernel 2.4.18) to "hold" our link to

    GNU/Linux is the default desktop operating system at Harvard EECS.
    Debian is a popular choice, and we are currently working on installing
    it as our default distribution.  Ease of configuration, security updates
    and package management are its primary advantages.  An automated install
    process is in the works; we also locally mirror Debian packages.

# From: Emmanuel le Chevoir <manu42@free.fr>
<userdetail "INSIA" "INSIA" "http://www.insia.org">
  <p>
    We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
    developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
    was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
    easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
    underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
    Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
    policies. These are two important points in an educational
    environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
    Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
    of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
    then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
    choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a
    means to bring people to change their mind about free software and
    software development in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    The INSIA has about 300 students this year (i.e. on September, 2002). We have 
    150 brand new Intel-based workstations, running Debian/stable + some 
    self-packaged pieces of software such as XFree86, which we need because i845 
    video chipset are not supported in XF4.1. We also have 10 servers running 
    various services, such as Apache web server, Postfix mail server, etc...

    Before we use it, we used to have FreeBSD as our main system
    server, and after we try this distro, we kinda like the idea
    behind the powerful 'apt-get install' command.  So we use it ever
    since...

  <p>
    We use Debian as one of 4 standard platforms (the others being Sun
    Solaris, HP-UX and Compaq Tru-64) for members of the department
    and it is the only standard platform for our student labs.
  </p>
  <p>
    Currently we maintain about 150 Debian workstations and a handfull
    of Debian servers (samba, database, web, print ...) in a
    semi-automatic way: all are kept up to date automatically, based
    on a few master machines and we have been doing this with Debian
    since 1997.  The reason for choosing Debian over other Linux
    distributions are obvious : ease of package administration, smooth
    upgrades, installs, ... other distributions might offer other
    software packages, but none offer the same degree of quality ...
    if it's available in Debian, it just works.

<userdetail "MIT" "Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Artificial Intelligence Lab" "http://www.ai.mit.edu">
  <p>
    In the MIT AI lab the "Officially Supported" flavor of GNU/Linux
    is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
    Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
    compute cycles (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
    reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
    here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
    semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
    system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
    problems).

  <p>
    We power our linux workstations, notebooks and servers (a total of
    130 at the moment, growing fast) with an self-made
    autoinstallation of Debian (just converting to woody, we plan to
    publish it when it is ready). Our conf-update package handles the
    initial installation and hardware detection and configuration as
    well as upgrades, all non-interactive. Several servers (e.g.
    mail, a compute server) are also handled this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian years ago, because we have the full possibility to
    change everything to our needs and because it is relatively easy
    to do upgrades (security,...). The well tested state of each
    release gives us a reassuring stable base to build our additions
    and upgrades (e.g for new hardware) on.

  <p>
    At this public school, Debian is used on a small number of
    workstations and a couple servers serving the Debian boxes for
    home directories, DNS, etc.  Debian is used by the students
    primarily for programming and computer graphics classes, extensive
    use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
    boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
    problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
    keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
    desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the
    simplest form possible for the student-run network.  MSNRSTHS is a
    public magnet school in the Beaverton School District.

<userdetail "MontanaTech" "Montana Tech, Butte, Montana, USA" "http://www.mtech.edu/">
  <p>
    At the CS Department of Montana Tech, we run Debian 3.0 on our two main
    department servers (one's the nfs server, the other's the main server
    people use for interactive off-campus logins), and on 11 other hosts
    set up as a general-purpose lab used by roughly 60 students of three of
    our courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have no assigned systems administrator, so it was very important that
    our systems run with a minimum of fuss, day in and day out.  Debian 3.0
    has lived up to this challenge:  the students use our servers for
    networking assignments, C and C++ programming, and the systems have
    been trouble-free.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian's package system (we usually just access it via dselect) is
    a big win.  Security updates are hassle-free, and our systems meet
    our current needs quite comfortably.  I've used a variety of
    commercial Unixes, and Debian's packaging system and reliability
    beats them all, hands-down.  (For what it's worth, I've been a
    full-time systems administrator in both academic and industry
    settings, so my experience with commercial systems has been both
    prolonged and painful...)

    members, although a few others use Red Hat and most use other
    operating systems.
  </p>
  <p>
    In large part, we use Debian for historical reasons. When we first

  <p>
    Before Debian was adopted, the Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) used
    several different Linux distributions: one for servers, another for
    touchscreens, another for itaniums, another for desktops, etc, and the
    use of Linux was not widespread.  Each of these other distributions
    were capable in their niche, but had limitations which did not allow
    them to be used in other capacities.  As the use of Linux at the GSC
    grew, it became burdensome to maintain all these different
    distributions.  We decided to standardize on Debian GNU/Linux, since
    it is the only distrubution that gives of the power and flexibity we
    need to cover all these different machine requirements.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian GNU/Linux was first deployed at the GSC as a desktop
    workstation operating system and now is running on roughly 50
    workstations.  More importantly, our whole data tracking system is run
    on about 80 Debian GNU/Linux machines with touchscreen monitors and
    barcode scan guns.  Once Debian proved its mettle on the desktop and

    Debian currently runs on the main webserver (cthulhu.gdc.wpi.edu -
    Dual Pentium Pro), and the main login server, which handles mail
    as well (lovecraft.gdc.wpi.edu - Alpha DS-10 - currently down due

    I'm no longer the organization's sysadmin (I graduated) - however,
    I chose Debian for the systems I had control of because of my

    apsfilter and abuse), and because of the high security by default
    - as well as the application support, and hardware support for the
