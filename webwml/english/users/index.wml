<userdetail "MIT" "Massachusets Institute of Technology, Artificial Intelligence Lab" "http://www.ai.mit.edu">
  <p>
    In the MIT AI lab the "Officially Supported" flavor of GNU/Linux
    is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
    Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
    compute cycles (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
    reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
    here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
    semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
    system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
    problems).
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "thawte.com" "Thawte.com" "http://www.thawte.com">
  <p>
    We run our web infrastructure on Debian woody - 12 servers including DR
    site. We also run 10 developer workstations on Debian. We've used Debian
    since 1997 or earlier (bo -&gt; hamm -&gt; slink -&gt; potato -&gt; woody...)
  </p>
  <p>
    Reasons we love Debian include the package management, security updates
    and the Free Software egalitarian philosophy.

<userdetail "bayour.com" "Bayour.com" "http://bayour.com">
  <p>
    I'm using Debian GNU/Linux on one i386 user server (doing
    IMAP, POP, Shell services etc). To this comes two Debian
    GNU/Linux SPARC servers hosting the LDAP, Kerberos and
    DNSSEC services for my network.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the Intel, the users authenticate/authorize against the
    LDAP/Kerberos setup (no users in traditional /etc/{passwd,shadow}
    etc). Using AFS (OpenAFS) for distributed storage of webdirectories,
    homedirectories etc guaranties availability and security
    of file services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can now (if need be) have access to their homedirectory
    at home securely through this encrypted network filesystem.

<userdetail "MerloStation" "Merlo Station Science and Technology High School, Beaverton, Oregon" "http://www.beavton.k12.or.us/merlo_station/sst/">
  <p>
    At this public school, Debian is used on a small number of
    workstations and a couple servers serving the Debian boxes for
    home directories, DNS, etc.  Debian is used by the students
    primarily for programming and computer graphics classes, extensive
    use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
    boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
    problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
    keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
    desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the
    simplest form possible for the student-run network.  MSNRSTHS is a
    public magnet school in the Beaverton School District.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "IMAPMC" "City Hall of Campinas city, Sao Paulo, Brazil">
  <p>
    We use Debian in all Linux servers (there are also Solaris and AIX
    servers).  Debian takes care of email, Web, DNS and light database
    services.  Mission critical applications for the city management
    run on Debian servers.
  </p>
</userdetail>
    
<userdetail "hardware.no" "Hardware.no" "http://www.hardware.no">
  <p>
    We run about eight servers, all running Debian, serving one of the
    largest online tech news sites in Norway.  Debian provides good and
    timely security updates and its developers are usually quite
    responsive to bug reports and such.  We'll be continuing running
    Debian.
  </p>
</userdetail>
    
<userdetail "euronetics" "EuroNetics Operation KB" "http://www.euronetics.se/">
  <p>
     At EuroNetics Operation KB we have standardized on the Debian platform and use
     it on over thirty servers and on our diskless clients. We use it because of the
     stability, amount of packaged software and ease of updates.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "grundig" "Grundig AG" "http://www.grundig.de/">
  <p>
    We are just ongoing to change all servers from Windows 2000 to
    Debian "woody". The reasons are costs, reliability, security, fast
    security updates and ease of use.
  </p>

<userdetail "intellicare" "Intellicare GmbH" "http://www.intellicare.de/">
  <p>
    At IntelliCare, I am currently replacing my SuSE desktop (Network 
    Administration workstation) and our Gentoo IDS sensors with Debian. We 
    develop hardware &amp; software for hospitals, and we will use Debian for HA server 
    clusters as well as workstations (development is currently on Windows, but we 
    plan to migrate/cross-develop ASAP). The main reasons for choosing Debian are 
    that it is a free, open-source GNU system, and the wonderful support through 
    the world-wide accessible Newsgroups and mailing lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    At home, my wife &amp; I am of course using Debian as well.
  </p>
</userdetail>
							   
<userdetail "UNSW-CS" "School of Computer Science, University of New South Wales, Australia">
  <p>
    CSE, UNSW, are now standardized on Debian for all their ia32 equipment,
    which includes all the computers in the undergraduate teaching
    labs. In all, this is over 500 computers.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "UNSW-BIO" "Bioinformatics, University of New South Wales, Australia">
  <p>
    Within Bioinformatics, all the machines, both servers and
    workstations have been standardized on using Debian. This is
    generally because of the high levels of support available from
    Debian, and the simplified administration that the Debian package
    management system provides.  Lesser, but still strong reasons are
    the care and quality checking that most maintainers put in their
    packages.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "UNSW-COMPSOC" "COMPSOC, Computing Students Society, UNSW">
  <p>
    COMPSOC, as a society that represents over five thousand students
    to various bodies, both inside and outside of UNSW, have
    centralised on using Debian on all their hosts. Reasons for this
    include the fact that Debian will run, without tweaking, on a large
    range of hardware - of different architectures, and of differing
    age.  This single fact vastly simplifies administration, and makes
    it easier to centralise many tasks. The quality control and
    package management are also bonuses for us.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "hispalinux" "Spanish Linux User Group" "http://www.hispalinux.es">
  <p>
    We use it in all our servers (3 at the moment). We choose it for being
    free (of course, for being Debian, too).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is our WEB server, FTP server, RSYNC server, DAV server, Mail
    server, CVS server... it is EVERYWHERE!
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "heureka" "HeureKA -- Der EDV Dienstleister" "http://www.heureka.co.at/">
  <p>
    We provide web, mail and file services on-site to our SME
    customers. After being long time SuSE users, we switched completly over
    to Debian GNU/Linux one and a half year ago. The online upgrade
    facilities greatly reduced the need for on-site technical work, reducing
    cost both for our customers and us. Especially the quick online security
    updates and the ease of installation reduce the administrative load on
    our decent number of deployed systems.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "carnet" "CARNet, Croatian Academic and Research Network" "http://www.carnet.hr/">
  <p>
    CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
    used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris
    systems, .deb is used as the preferred package format, the whole
    GNU tool set is packaged, and in fact switching to entirely free
    operating systems like GNU/Linux is perfectly allowed and welcomed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
    and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
    running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
    users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
    Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
    packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
    to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
    deploy even more Debian servers in the future.

<userdetail "cistron" "Cistron" "http://www.cistron.nl">
  <p>
    ISP running completely on Debian GNU/Linux.  Doing so from the
    beginning, lots of our people are (Debian-) Linux maintainers.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "UNI" "National Technical University (UNI - Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería), Nicaragua">
  <p>
    On the National Tecnical University (UNI - Universidad Nacional de
    Ingeniería) in Managua/Nicaragua, we are running Debian GNU/Linux on the
    five main servers, one Gateway-Linux Box at the (net-)independente
    faculty of Electricity and Computing and are going to switch to Debian
    soon in the students lab at the central library with approx. 35
    computers.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "Doshisha" "Doshisha University" "http://www.doshisha.ac.jp">
  <p>
     At Doshisha University, Debian "potato" runs on 256-node Beowulf
     cluster, cambria.doshisha.ac.jp. They are arranged on 16-node 
     computer groups which have 1 diskfull and 15 diskless machines.
     Maintenance with Debian installed has been a pleasure with security 
     updates being only an apt-get away, and the updates being 
     very prompt.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "Republica" "Facultad de Ciencias and Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la República">
  <p>
    At the "Facultad de Ciencias", Debian "woody" runs on over 20
    servers. Including the main internet servers: web, mail, ftp, DNS
    and firewall. Also there is a incipient computing center, for
    scientific software runing almost entirely under woody, and
    several workstations for the students.
  </p>
</userdetail>    

<userdetail "artselect" "Artselect.com" "http://www.artselect.com">
  <p>
    We use Debian and other open-source tools throughout all technical
    aspects of the company: clusters, workstations, remote order
    fulfillment relays, etc., and have since we began in early 1998.
    We chose Debian for stability, security, ease of administration,
    and upgradeability.
  </p>
  <p>
    We sell custom-framed art prints (currently US-only due to export
    headaches), and build customized framed-art sites for third parties.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "INSIA" "INSIA" "http://www.insia.org">
  <p>
    We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
    developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
    was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
    easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
    underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
    Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
    policies. These are two important points in an educational
    environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
    Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
    of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
    then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
    choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a
    means to bring people to change their mind about free software and
    software development in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    The INSIA has about 300 students this year (i.e. on September, 2002). We have 
    150 brand new Intel-based workstations, running Debian/stable + some 
    self-packaged pieces of software such as XFree86, which we need because i845 
    video chipset are not supported in XF4.1. We also have 10 servers running 
    various services, such as Apache web server, Postfix mail server, etc...
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "CharlesRetina" "Charles Retina Institute" "http://www.charles-retina.com">
  <p>
    We use Debian/i386 on one server that lets us do backups of
    Windows workstations using smbfs, mail service with exim,
    antivirus checking using amavis, file service using samba, web
    development using Perl and Template Toolkit, and a plethora of
    administrative tasks.
  </p>
  <p>
    We found Debian simpler to maintain than the alternatives, and the
    support, on the mailing lists, can't be beat.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "tuxfamily" "TuxFamily" "http://www.tuxfamily.org">
  <p>
    Tuxfamily runs 7 Debian "Woody" on i386 architecture.  All
services are redundant and load-balanced. Tuxfamily is involved in
Debian (4 administrators are Debian Developers) and everything dealing
with freedom, not only free software but also
<a href="http://artlibre.org/">free art licensing</a>.

<userdetail "UOA-IARC" "University of Alaska Fairbanks, IARC -- Frontier Program" "http://www.frontier.iarc.uaf.edu">
  <p>
    Debian is used in our organization as our primary flavor of Unix,
    and is installed on all of our servers (file, print, backup, web,
    ftp, email, Samba, netatalk) and the Unix workstations that
    scientists use.  In addition, we have a (currently) 12 node
    cluster running Debian.  In total, Debian is running on almost 40
    desktop and server systems, as well as more than a dozen laptops.
  </p>
  <p>
    I chose Debian because it has a superior package format that keeps
    track of dependencies and is easy to use remotely, and because of
    the number of packages available (more than 10,000 right now).
    The bug reporting (and fixing!) system is excellent, and the
    volunteer help I've received over the years has been incredible.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "CIPSGA" "CIPSGA - Comite de Incentivo a Produção do Software GNU e Alternativo" "http://www.cipsga.org.br">
  <p>
    CIPSGA is a non-governmental (non-profit) organization which works
    interfacing the statal companies (be them federal, statal or
    municipal) with the GNU community. During its first three years of
    existence, we have given tens of speeches, and supported the use
    of GNU software inside these businesses. Thanks to our work, we
    expect to have more than 25 thousand machines running Debian
    GNU/Linux in the next 12 months (servers and workstations.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides that, CIPSGA has placed 2 of the 8 Brazilian Debian
    Developers, which now work in statal companies supporting Debian
    GNU/Linux. We created a customization of Debian Woody meant to be
    used in schools, unions and other organizations. It consists of an
    application server with a semi-automated install procedure which
    requires only 4 simple steps to complete. We are creating a
    Debian-friendly scenario in Brazil, which is very likely to spread
    all over the country, in schools and in "Telecenters" that are
    being created to aid in the democratization of Internet access.
