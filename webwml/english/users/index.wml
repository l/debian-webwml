  <p>
    In the MIT AI lab the "Officially Supported" flavor of GNU/Linux
    is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
    Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
    compute cycles (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
    reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
    here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
    semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
    system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
    problems).

<userdetail "bayour.com" "Bayour.com" "http://bayour.com">
  <p>
    I'm using Debian GNU/Linux on one i386 user server (doing
    IMAP, POP, Shell services etc). To this comes two Debian
    GNU/Linux SPARC servers hosting the LDAP, Kerberos and
    DNSSEC services for my network.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the Intel, the users authenticate/authorize against the
    LDAP/Kerberos setup (no users in traditional /etc/{passwd,shadow}
    etc). Using AFS (OpenAFS) for distributed storage of webdirectories,
    homedirectories etc guaranties availability and security
    of file services.
  </p>
  <p>
    Users can now (if need be) have access to their homedirectory
    at home securely through this encrypted network filesystem.

<userdetail "MerloStation" "Merlo Station Science and Technology High School, Beaverton, Oregon" "http://www.beavton.k12.or.us/merlo_station/sst/">
  <p>
    At this public school, Debian is used on a small number of
    workstations and a couple servers serving the Debian boxes for
    home directories, DNS, etc.  Debian is used by the students
    primarily for programming and computer graphics classes, extensive
    use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
    boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
    problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
    keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
    desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the
    simplest form possible for the student-run network.  MSNRSTHS is a
    public magnet school in the Beaverton School District.

<userdetail "IMAPMC" "City Hall of Campinas city, Sao Paulo, Brazil">
  <p>
    We use Debian in all Linux servers (there are also Solaris and AIX
    servers).  Debian takes care of email, Web, DNS and light database
    services.  Mission critical applications for the city management
    run on Debian servers.
  </p>
</userdetail>
    
<userdetail "hardware.no" "Hardware.no" "http://www.hardware.no">
  <p>
    We run about eight servers, all running Debian, serving one of the
    largest online tech news sites in Norway.  Debian provides good and
    timely security updates and its developers are usually quite
    responsive to bug reports and such.  We'll be continuing running
    Debian.
  </p>
</userdetail>
    
<userdetail "euronetics" "EuroNetics Operation KB" "http://www.euronetics.se/">
  <p>
     At EuroNetics Operation KB we have standardized on the Debian platform and use
     it on over thirty servers and on our diskless clients. We use it because of the
     stability, amount of packaged software and ease of updates.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "grundig" "Grundig AG" "http://www.grundig.de/">
  <p>
    We are just ongoing to change all servers from Windows 2000 to
    Debian "woody". The reasons are costs, reliability, security, fast
    security updates and ease of use.

<userdetail "intellicare" "Intellicare GmbH" "http://www.intellicare.de/">
  <p>
    At IntelliCare, I am currently replacing my SuSE desktop (Network 
    Administration workstation) and our Gentoo IDS sensors with Debian. We 
    develop hardware &amp; software for hospitals, and we will use Debian for HA server 
    clusters as well as workstations (development is currently on Windows, but we 
    plan to migrate/cross-develop ASAP). The main reasons for choosing Debian are 
    that it is a free, open-source GNU system, and the wonderful support through 
    the world-wide accessible Newsgroups and mailing lists.
  </p>
  <p>
    At home, my wife &amp; I am of course using Debian as well.
  </p>

<userdetail "UNSW-CS" "School of Computer Science, University of New South Wales, Australia">
  <p>
    CSE, UNSW, are now standardized on Debian for all their ia32 equipment,
    which includes all the computers in the undergraduate teaching
    labs. In all, this is over 500 computers.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "UNSW-BIO" "Bioinformatics, University of New South Wales, Australia">
  <p>
    Within Bioinformatics, all the machines, both servers and
    workstations have been standardized on using Debian. This is
    generally because of the high levels of support available from
    Debian, and the simplified administration that the Debian package
    management system provides.  Lesser, but still strong reasons are
    the care and quality checking that most maintainers put in their
    packages.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "UNSW-COMPSOC" "COMPSOC, Computing Students Society, UNSW">
  <p>
    COMPSOC, as a society that represents over five thousand students
    to various bodies, both inside and outside of UNSW, have
    centralised on using Debian on all their hosts. Reasons for this
    include the fact that Debian will run, without tweaking, on a large
    range of hardware - of different architectures, and of differing
    age.  This single fact vastly simplifies administration, and makes
    it easier to centralise many tasks. The quality control and
    package management are also bonuses for us.
  </p>

<userdetail "hispalinux" "Spanish Linux User Group" "http://www.hispalinux.es">
  <p>
    We use it in all our servers (3 at the moment). We choose it for being
    free (of course, for being Debian, too).
  </p>
  <p>
    It is our WEB server, FTP server, RSYNC server, DAV server, Mail
    server, CVS server... it is EVERYWHERE!
  </p>

<userdetail "heureka" "HeureKA -- Der EDV Dienstleister" "http://www.heureka.co.at/">
  <p>
    We provide web, mail and file services on-site to our SME
    customers. After being long time SuSE users, we switched completly over
    to Debian GNU/Linux one and a half year ago. The online upgrade
    facilities greatly reduced the need for on-site technical work, reducing
    cost both for our customers and us. Especially the quick online security
    updates and the ease of installation reduce the administrative load on
    our decent number of deployed systems.
  </p>

<userdetail "carnet" "CARNet, Croatian Academic and Research Network" "http://www.carnet.hr/">
  <p>
    CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
    used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris
    systems, .deb is used as the preferred package format, the whole
    GNU tool set is packaged, and in fact switching to entirely free
    operating systems like GNU/Linux is perfectly allowed and welcomed.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
    and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
    running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
    users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
    Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
    packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
    to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
    deploy even more Debian servers in the future.

<userdetail "cistron" "Cistron" "http://www.cistron.nl">
  <p>
    ISP running completely on Debian GNU/Linux.  Doing so from the
    beginning, lots of our people are (Debian-) Linux maintainers.

<userdetail "UNI" "National Technical University (UNI - Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería), Nigeria">
  <p>
    On the National Tecnical University (UNI - Universidad Nacional de
    Ingeniería) in Managua/Nicaragua, we are running Debian GNU/Linux on the
    five main servers, one Gateway-Linux Box at the (net-)independente
    faculty of Electricity and Computing and are going to switch to Debian
    soon in the students lab at the central library with aprox. 35
    computers.

<userdetail "Doshisha" "Doshisha University" "http://www.doshisha.ac.jp">
  <p>
     At Doshisha University, Debian "potato" runs on 256-node Beowulf
     cluster, cambria.doshisha.ac.jp. They are arranged on 16-node 
     computer groups which have 1 diskfull and 15 diskless machines.
     Maintenance with Debian installed has been a pleasure with security 
     updates being only an apt-get away, and the updates being 
     very prompt.
  </p>
</userdetail>

<userdetail "Republica" "Facultad de Ciencias and Facultad de Medicina, Universidad de la República">
  <p>
    At the "Facultad de Ciencias", Debian "woody" runs on over 20
    servers. Including the main internet servers: web, mail, ftp, DNS
    and firewall. Also there is a insipient computing center, for
    scientific software runing almost entirely under woody, and
    several workstations for the students.
