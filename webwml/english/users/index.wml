  <p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux to run a little server for the
    department, with internal web pages and shared home
    directories. The services are to be competitive with the
    university's own server, which runs a text-only HP-UX without any
    of the modern instruments and applications (no TeX, old (2.0)
    navigator, poor termcap support, very poor technical support, no
    modern shell), so we decided to run our own server. Also the
    server controls the two departmental printers, serving a lpd and a
    cups queue.
  </p>
  <p>
    We choose Linux to grant multiuser and desk-independent access to
    the users, easier configurability and updating, and totally
    cost-free solution, and in particular Debian for the extreme
    stability and availability. Moreover, our cousin department is
    serving a stable ftp distribution, so it was also a matter of
    bandwidth.

  <p>
    At Bond Uni we're using Debian to teach students unix system
    adminstration and security, as well as for about 10 servers
    (mostly research-related boxes). Debian is just the best
    distribution for maintaining servers.

    Debian is our primary *nix platform, with over 300 desktops and server
    machines on our department network.  Previously a Sun shop, we still
    have some Suns and we also support Redhat Linux and Windows.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian for several reasons, among them:  easy upgrades, the large
    number of packages, well-thought-out package defaults, and stability.

<userdetail "Calgary" "Physics and Astronomy, University of Calgary, Canada" "http://phas.ucalgary.ca/">
  <p>
    Physics and Astronomy runs Debian on the main departmental server. 
    There are workstations and servers throughout the department that run on
    Debian which are used by faculty, staff and grad students.  In the
    science theaters, a lab of twenty+ Debian workstations is open for all
    physics students to use with a central Debian lab server. 
  </p>
  <p>
    We find Debian as reliable and as easy to use than the previous SGI Irix
    machines and the Sun Sparc machines.  Some of the Sparc's have been
    converted to Debian OS.  We still do computational work with SGI
    and Sun's but hope in the future to have a Debian cluster up and running
    (funding permitting).

    Using Debian to provide authentication and file and print serving via NFS,
    NIS, CUPS and Samba to ~100 desktop, laptop, workstation and data-taking
    machines in a research group studying aspects of semiconductor devices,
    particularly at low temperatures. A backup server performs rsync-based
    'snapshot' backups and writes tapes for archive purposes. This combination
    has recently survived the complete failure of our 0.5TB RAID system with a
    loss of only about 16 hours' data. Our 'user' machines run, in approximate
    order of descending number, Windows, RiscOS, Linux (Debian, Red-Hat,
    Mandrake), MacOS, HP Unix. For a cash-limited research group, the free
    software route is an obvious choice. Debian ties in well with our existing
    expertise (the main administrator of the server has been running Debian
    since 0.93) and is supported by the University Unix Support team.

    Using Debian to provide the College's web server and have been since 1995.
    Despite temperatures in the non-airconditioned room taking an average of
    18 months to destroy the web server, Debian has provided the tools
    necessary to recover data from the (almost) trashed discs several times.
    At the time of first installing, the Debian machine replaced a Windows 3.1
    web server - which had to be taken off-line in order to update the site.
    Clearly a great step up.

    GNU/Linux. Thanks to pzn@debian.org.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use Debian Woody (kernel 2.4.18) to "hold" our link to
    Internet, using radio frequency, pcmcia modules an so on. We use
    IPTables and Squid to share the connection with the internal
    network. All in a only one server.  Other schools use the same
    solution.  Live long and prosper, Debian.

# From: Clement Moyroud <moyroudc@esiee.fr>
<userdetail "ESIEE" "ESIEE Engineering School, Paris, France" "http://www.esiee.fr/eng/">
  <p>
    ESIEE has been introducing Linux for the past few years in its IT
    infrastructure, on several levels.
  </p>
  <p>
    The first part is the migration from HP/UX workstation used for
    application-specific tasks - such as electronic design tools and
    mathematics software - to standardized PCs running Linux. At the
    moment, 75% of the workstations have been replaced. The last 25%
    will be replaced once the electronic CAD software vendors will
    have ported their applications to Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
    The second part is the introduction of Debian as a dual-boot
    system on the students-accessible computers. The goal of the
    introduction of Linux is to bring more flexibility for the
    planning of lessons, as Linux can replace both HP/UX workstations
    for scientific tasks and Windows computers for Internet access and
    office work.  The third part is the migration of servers from
    HP/UX, Banyan Vines and Windows NT to Debian-based Linux
    systems. The switch was accelerated when it was decided to replace
    the aging Banyan solution with a LDAP/Samba account system on the
    Windows computers that are accessible to the students and the
    staff of the school.  The long term objective is to replace as
    much Windows computers as possible, even for the administrative
    personnel.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian was choosen for its ease of administration and installation
    through the use of .debs and FAI, allowing installation of labs of
    12 computers within 20 minutes without the need for a CD or a
    floppy and without any user interaction. The creation of packages
    from vendor binaries enables an easy, consistent and fast way for
    installing the same software across around 200 computers used for
    scientific tasks.

    We use Debian on every computer of our institution; we have 18
    computers used by our students, 3 more assigned to teachers, 1
    supporting secretary labors and 1 dedicated to technical
    administrative tasks.  We support the grading process using
    software that is being developed at
    <url "http://structio.sourceforge.net/">.
  </p>
  <p>
    These resources are used by all the academic community, children
    from 6 and teachers up to 60 experience the system.  Our internal
    DNS, NIS/NFs rings, wireless operation, CVS, HTTP, FTP, Dict,
    chat, routing schemas services are supported also by Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are using Debian exclusively since 2001.  Its ease of
    administration, wide documentation, and friendly community

    BIND9 nameserver, iptables, the Squid proxy cache, Postfix
    mailserver, qpopper, proftpd ftp daemon and a couple of other
    little tools and programs.
  </p>

<userdetail "INSIA" "INSIA, France" "http://www.insia.org/">
  <p>
    We chose to run Debian for many reasons. First, I'm both Debian
    developer and system administrator of the campus, so using Debian
    was quite a natural step.  Then, we needed a secure, stable, and
    easy to maintain Linux distribution for our 10 servers. The
    underlying security infrastructure was clearly a good point for
    Debian.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, we chose Debian because of its relying philosophy and
    policies. These are two important points in an educational
    environment. Our students are to become engineers, and using
    Debian on an everyday basis will hopefully help us to counter some
    of the most common clichés about free software, first at school,
    then at work. Using Debian at INSIA is not just a matter of
    choosing an Operating System or a Linux Distribution. It's also a
    means to bring people to change their mind about free software and
    software development in general.
  </p>
  <p>
    The INSIA has about 300 students this year (i.e. on September, 2002). We have 
    150 brand new Intel-based workstations, running Debian/stable + some 
    self-packaged pieces of software such as XFree86, which we need because i845 
    video chipset are not supported in XF4.1. We also have 10 servers running 
    various services, such as Apache web server, Postfix mail server, etc...

  <p>
    Currently we maintain about 150 Debian workstations and a handfull
    of Debian servers (samba, database, web, print ...) in a
    semi-automatic way: all are kept up to date automatically, based
    on a few master machines and we have been doing this with Debian
    since 1997.  The reason for choosing Debian over other Linux
    distributions are obvious : ease of package administration, smooth
    upgrades, installs, ... other distributions might offer other
    software packages, but none offer the same degree of quality ...
    if it's available in Debian, it just works.

  <p>
    Being a private school, the Lycée Molière does not benefit from all the
    State sponsored grants public schools would normaly do. Offering to 
    pupils the same quality of teaching as in other schools is therefore
    sometimes a major challenge.
  </p>
  <p>    
    When it came to provide the common Internet services to the school, the
    GNU/Linux solution became obvious to us. Our network is made of +/- 30 
    Macintosh Imacs (still running MacOS, for the moment at least!) on the 
    workstation side, and of 1 mail server (exim, cyrus-IMAPd and 
    squirrelMail), one web server (apache), one DNS server (bind9), one file 
    server (netatalk) and one proxy server (Squid + squidGuard), on the 
    server side.
  </p>
  <p>
    As the school is noway in the position to hire a full-time IT admin, all 
    those machines have to be as stable and secure as possible and what other 
    distribution would do that better than Debian?

  <p>
    In the MIT AI lab the "Officially Supported" flavor of GNU/Linux
    is Debian.  There are approximately 100 user workstations running
    Debian, as well as a small but growing OpenMosix Cluster serving
    compute cycles (<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/sysadmin/cluster.html</a>).
  </p>
  <p>
    The switch to Debian was made official in September 2001.  The largest
    reason being the ease of package management, which users love (users
    here get that kind of freedom) and also allows the sysadmins to
    semi-automate security updates (we like to check the updates on a test
    system before forcing them on the users, but to date there's been no
    problems).

  <p>
    We power our linux workstations, notebooks and servers (a total of
    130 at the moment, growing fast) with an self-made
    autoinstallation of Debian (just converting to woody, we plan to
    publish it when it is ready). Our conf-update package handles the
    initial installation and hardware detection and configuration as
    well as upgrades, all non-interactive. Several servers (e.g.
    mail, a compute server) are also handled this way.
  </p>
  <p>
    We chose Debian years ago, because we have the full possibility to
    change everything to our needs and because it is relatively easy
    to do upgrades (security,...). The well tested state of each
    release gives us a reassuring stable base to build our additions
    and upgrades (e.g for new hardware) on.

    use of The GIMP, blender, emacs and GCC.  I switched the Linux
    boxes from Red Hat for security and simplicity, RPM is a major
    problem to deal with and allowing anybody with access to the
    keyboard to reboot and get root on a standard install was not
    desirable.  Debian gave the school what it needed most in the

    At the CS Department of Montana Tech, we run Debian 3.0 on our two main

    people use for interactive off-campus logins), and on 11 other hosts
    set up as a general-purpose lab used by roughly 60 students of three of
    our courses.
  </p>
  <p>
    We have no assigned systems administrator, so it was very important that
    our systems run with a minimum of fuss, day in and day out.  Debian 3.0
    has lived up to this challenge:  the students use our servers for
    networking assignments, C and C++ programming, and the systems have
    been trouble-free.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian's package system (we usually just access it via dselect) is
    a big win.  Security updates are hassle-free, and our systems meet
    our current needs quite comfortably.  I've used a variety of
    commercial Unixes, and Debian's packaging system and reliability
    beats them all, hands-down.  (For what it's worth, I've been a
    full-time systems administrator in both academic and industry
    settings, so my experience with commercial systems has been both

    several servers with Debian woody. Apart from the servers, all computers 
    are integrated in the NIS+ domain and get their home-directories via NFS 
    from a central SUN E450. They get updated via apt-get whereby all packages 
    are adapted to the local circumstances beforehand, so that the users in the 
    faculties do not have to do any system administration. The most important 
    data of the clients are stored in a central MySQL database, which is 
    connected during the installation and everyday administrative processes.

  <p>
    Debian was mainly chosen for its ease of administration and software 
    updates. Its well-tested release policy reduces the amount of updates and

    Before Debian was adopted, the Genome Sequencing Center (GSC) used
    several different Linux distributions: one for servers, another for
    touchscreens, another for itaniums, another for desktops, etc, and the
    use of Linux was not widespread.  Each of these other distributions
    were capable in their niche, but had limitations which did not allow
    them to be used in other capacities.  As the use of Linux at the GSC
    grew, it became burdensome to maintain all these different
    distributions.  We decided to standardize on Debian GNU/Linux, since
    it is the only distrubution that gives of the power and flexibity we
    need to cover all these different machine requirements.

    When it came time to have an outside firm develop a robust

    business, the Debian platform was chosen over other commercial Unixes.
    We now have 5 machines running. More than a few of our administrators

    platform and the total flexitibility, although we still have our share
    of Windows around here.

    package management, sensible defaults, stability, and the Debian
    community.

    CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
    used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris
    systems, .deb is used as the preferred package format, the whole
    GNU tool set is packaged, and in fact switching to entirely free
    operating systems like GNU/Linux is perfectly allowed and welcomed.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
    and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
    running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
    users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
    Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
    packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
    to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
    deploy even more Debian servers in the future.

  <p>
    CIPSGA is a non-governmental (non-profit) organization which works
    interfacing the statal companies (be them federal, statal or
    municipal) with the GNU community. During its first three years of
    existence, we have given tens of speeches, and supported the use
    of GNU software inside these businesses. Thanks to our work, we
    expect to have more than 25 thousand machines running Debian
    GNU/Linux in the next 12 months (servers and workstations.)
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides that, CIPSGA has placed 2 of the 8 Brazilian Debian
    Developers, which now work in statal companies supporting Debian
    GNU/Linux. We created a customization of Debian Woody meant to be
    used in schools, unions and other organizations. It consists of an
    application server with a semi-automated install procedure which
    requires only 4 simple steps to complete. We are creating a
    Debian-friendly scenario in Brazil, which is very likely to spread
    all over the country, in schools and in "Telecenters" that are
    being created to aid in the democratization of Internet access.

    We use Debian to provide dial-in access and a mail server for
    around 60 elderly and house-bound people in the Mornington
    Peninsula in the state of Victoria in Australia. One P133
    provides these services as well as acting as a firewall and a

    Our virtual community, which has been in operation since 1996, now
    runs on a Debian GNU/Linux server (replacing what was originally a
    Sun Enterprise server, then a slew of Windows NT Server boxes).
    Debian has been my favorite distro for some time now, and its ease
    of performing system updates combined with its ease of
    customization and its overall stability made it a natural choice
    for our community-purchased server.  The server runs our Web
    community software, the Venice Web Communities System
    <a href="http://venice.sourceforge.net">http://venice.sourceforge.net</a>,
    on top of Apache, Tomcat, and MySQL.
    </p>
  <p>
    Nothing short of
    catastrophic disk failure has been able to take our server offline
    since it was deployed.  We're proud to display Debian's logo on
    our Acknowledgements page

    SARA is one of the most advanced computing and networking centers in the

  </p>
  <p>
    At the department High Performance Computing we chose to use Debian for all our
    Linux based systems. The main reason was the good implementation of
    tools(package management, simple creation of own packages) to do system installs
    and upgrades. The systems we maintain are:

    All of our currently 6 Linux servers run Debian. There are web,
    file and DNS servers, a streaming server and more. Planned
    projects using Debian include have it run mail services as well as
    to replace our currently LRP based router.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debian replaced other Linux distributions mainly because of its
    ease of use and administration. Security updates or even updates
    from one release to its successor are as stable and easy as can
    be.
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides a fully operational network of diskless clients, some of
    our normal workstations also run Debian every day already.

    Debian is widely used here for distributed data acquisition,
    because its upgradability and reliability are unbeatable.  The
    system is presently in use on about 70 computers. One machine is
    using a raid disk pack of 300 GB as an online backup device for
    the department. An other is used as a Debian mirror providing the
    base for any internal upgrades. A computer node with 16x2 AMD
    CPUs in one rack is being implemented for the purpose of fast
    computer modelling of the magnetosphere.
