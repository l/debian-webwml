<p>
    We have more more than 30 servers running Debian. They include application 
    servers, backup server, database servers, geo servers, web servers, 
    monitoring server, proxy servers and more. The agency uses Debian servers 
    for many services, including e-mail, monitoring, security scanner, server 
    file sharing and application servers, among others.

<p>
    We chose Debian because of the great community suport, security, ease of 
    installation, use and maintenance, configurability and stability.
