#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Debian is used mainly for web and database servers.  We have 1 server hosting 
  a GForge instance, 1 server for php/mysql hosting, 1 server for j2ee hosting,
  and 1 test server.
</p>

<p>
  We chose Debian for its ease of administration, compared to e.g. RedHat or 
  Mandriva.
