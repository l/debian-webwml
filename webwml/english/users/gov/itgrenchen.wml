<p>
    We run Debian on some <q>office critical</q> servers, for example the mail 
    server (postfix) which does a good job as a spamfilter (spamassassin, 
    amavisd, clamav) for ~800 mailaccounts. Then we also use Debian for some 
    routing tasks. In the future we also want to use Debian on the desktop. 
</p>

<p>    
    The reasons to use Debian are various: It's easy to administrate specially 
    in bigger environments, it has easy to use update functions, we can use it 
    without always accepting some EULAs or renew contracts, for most purposes 
    is a software ready or it's a good programming environment.
