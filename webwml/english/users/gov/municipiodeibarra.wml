<p>
    We have two servers running Debian sarge 3.1, chosen because of its stability. 
    One server is running Java EE 5 Sun Application Server for the municipality's 
    e-commerce applications. The other server is a web server running apache 2, 
    php5, and a squid proxy, for our information site. We also have about 800 
    dual-boot workstations dual-boot with Windows and Debian.
