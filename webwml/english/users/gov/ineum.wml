<p>
    We have been using Debian since 2008.  Debian stable is running on two 
    Core-i7 965-based laboratory servers and on five Core2Quad-powered thin 
    clients.  Debian sid is used on two Core i7 870 based workstations.  Also, 
    Debian etch is used on a 4-CPU SPARC module for digital dynamic physical 
    simulation.

<p>
    We're using the powerful Scilab package for scientific modeling, and 
    KDevelop for software development.  Also, we're using Kerrighed clustering 
    software on the thin Debian clients to create a dynamic re-configurable 
    single system image cluster.
