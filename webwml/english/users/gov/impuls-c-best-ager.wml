<p>
    The regional employment pact in the area (BEST AGER) is a federal 
    <q>Perspektive 50plus – Beschäftigung in den Regionen</q> program, promoted 
    by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs as an 
    outstanding model project.
</p>

<p>
    We, the Impuls-C department from Dortmund, use Debian on one server (data, 
    e-mail, printers, web) and on eight workstations.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because it is super stable and because all of our tasks 
    can be done in an outstanding way without any license fees.  Hence more of 
    our finances are available for the actual purpose of the project, to 
    support long-term unemployed people.
