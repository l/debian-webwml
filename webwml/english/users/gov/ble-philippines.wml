<p>
    We currently have three Linux servers and two) of them are Debian GNU/Linux 
    based, one is our mailserver running postfix and the other is our local 
    database running on MySQL.

    I personally chose Debian because of its stability and security and to save 
    taxpayer's money by adopting free open source software.
