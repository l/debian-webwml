<p>
  Debian is widely used here for distributed data acquisition,
  because its upgradability and reliability are unbeatable.  The
  system is presently in use on about 70 computers. One machine is
  using a raid disk pack of 300 GB as an online backup device for
  the department. Another is used as a Debian mirror providing the
  base for any internal upgrades. A computer node with 16x2 AMD
  CPUs in one rack is being implemented for the purpose of fast
  computer modelling of the magnetosphere.
