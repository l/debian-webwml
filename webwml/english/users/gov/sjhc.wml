#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian Linux servers for all of our Linux based servers that don't 
    have commercial vendor requirements.  Including but not limited to web 
    servers, DNS servers, DHCP servers, Samba file servers and java application 
    servers.
</p>

<p>
    The reason we use Debian over competing Linux distributions is due to the 
    high quality of the Debian operating system, the speed in which Debian 
    releases security updates and the freedom to not have to manage software 
    licenses on our Linux servers. With commercial distributions we find we 
    spend more time managing licenses than managing servers.
