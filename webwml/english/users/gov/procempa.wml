#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Procempa has about 400 virtual machines running various versions of Debian 
    to support applications and services for the city of Porto Alegre, whose use 
    spans more than 15 years. We use Debian for running DNS, e-mail, web servers, 
    Java application servers, and network shares (Samba), amongst other services.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian due to its overall quality, best in industry package 
    management and commitment to Free Software.
