<p>
    We are using Debian as a desktop operating system.  Currently we are in the 
    process of migrating all systems in our office to Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 
    <q>Squeeze</q>.  That is four laptops and one workstation.  They are going 
    to run GNOME 2.30.2 and the primary programs to be used are:  OpenOffice 3, 
    Evolution, Epiphany, Scribus 1.3, Inkscape 0.47 and The GIMP 2.6.
</p>

<p>
    We have finally decided to use Debian to replace our old Windows XP systems 
    for, primarily, three reasons:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>stability and security</li>
    <li>to support a genuinely independent project, which also reflects some of 
	our own political ideas</li>
    <li>saving license fees</li>
</ol>
