#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We use Debian as the desktop operation system on all but one system in our 
office with four laptops and one workstation.
</p>

<p>
We use GNOME-environments and Xfce, LibreOffice, Sylpheed, Icedove, Iceweasel, 
Scribus, Inkscape, and GIMP.
</p>

<p>
We have been successfully using Debian GNU/Linux since 2011 to our full 
satisfaction. Our original decision to switch to Debian was based primarily 
on: stability and security, our desire to support a genuinely independent 
project which also reflects some of our own political ideas, and for saving 
licensing fees.
