<p>
    The Institute of Mathematical Sciences has been using Debian for a
    relatively long time (perhaps since 1998 or so). We first started with the 
    use of Debian for the <q>proxy</q> (squid) server and for our mirror of the 
    e-print archive (custom built <q>apache</q>). We then went on to the name servers 
    (<q>bind</q>), mail servers (<q>exim</q>), firewall (<q>iptables</q>) and remote access 
    machine (<q>ssh</q>). During the last two years or so even most desktop machines 
    (about 100) run Debian or a <q>clone</q>.

<p>
    The main reasons for this transition (we were essential a completely Solaris 
    + Xterm based operation until 1996) are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Debian's attention to detail that makes life easier for the system 
    administrator.</li>
    <li>The possibility to provide bug reports and participate in the process of 
    seeing these fixed.</li>
    <li>Some pro-active local users :-)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We had few problems installing Debian on servers. The main difficulties have 
    been with desktop installations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The difficulty of supporting newer hardware hit hard when we installed on 
    desktops.</li>
    <li>The entrenched support for Solaris and other legacy systems has been a 
    recurrent problem :-(</li>
    <li>There is a perception in many places that Debian is not for the desktop 
    users.</li>
</ul>
