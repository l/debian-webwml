#use wml::debian::users

<p>
 We are using Debian on half of our servers (6/10) since 1999 and we are
 planning to migrate others on this platform. We're using it for firewall (shorewall); dmz zone servers (web, mail, ftp); internal services as database (postgresql), fax (hylafax), dns and some custom services.

</p>

<p>
    We are very proud to use them and we are very happy end users: thanks to
all teams involved
into Debian development!
