<p>
    As the Internet Administrator of the Bureau of Immigration, I chose Debian 
    not only because of its rock solid stability and superior system security 
    but most of all, amongst others, it is by far the "real GNU/Linux distro".

<p>
    We ported all our web, mail, ftp and proxy servers to Debian in 2003, and 
    found it very reliable and stable.  "Absolute freedom is pure Debian".
