  We are developing a project to migrate 8000 NT's in Spanish public
  administration to Debian Woody, the project is named RHODAS. We are
  using a woody system adapted to our needs, we have our own repository
  and a different method of installation, you can find a document about
  it (by now in Spanish) in:
  <a href="http://es.tldp.org/Articulos/0000otras/doc-proyecto-rhodas/doc-proyecto-rhodas/book1.htm">http://es.tldp.org/Articulos/0000otras/doc-proyecto-rhodas/doc-proyecto-rhodas/book1.htm</a>
</p>

  We will have a big Debian network base, our servers actually run
  Debian too (over 200) . We have chosen Debian because of
  stability, functionality, level of development, flexibility and
  adaptability.
