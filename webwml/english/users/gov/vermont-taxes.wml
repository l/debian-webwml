<p>
    We use Debian GNU/Linux to fill various roles within our organization. 
    Debian GNU/Linux powers our developer server. The system runs trac and 
    subversion very well. Both applications as well as system logins are
    configured to authenticate against an Active Directory Domain.
</p>

<p>
    Debian also powers our web application hosting environment. We currently
    have 5 systems running JBoss and 5 systems running MySQL. We also have a
    Debian powered load balancer running pen.
</p>

<p>
    The main reason for choosing Debian over other distributions is the package
    management, number of available packages, ease-of-use, stability, amount of
    quality documentation, and cost.
