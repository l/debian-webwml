#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We run Debian on our servers since 1997 for various tasks.  First 
  internally as a file server (Samba), DNS/DHCP, web servers and then later 
  on our web servers and for external databases (Apache, PHP, PostgreSQL).
</p>
<p>
  Debian was chosen for the easy administration and upgrade process.
