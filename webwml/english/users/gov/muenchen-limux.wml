<p>
    We are using Debian GNU/Linux to run our system and configuration 
    management solutions FAI and GOsa to manage a couple of hundred Debian
    GNU/Linux based clients. At a later point in time we will deploy a
    couple of thousand clients.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian GNU/Linux (sarge/etch) to get the needed mix of maximum
    freedom, great technology, extreme stability and availability.
