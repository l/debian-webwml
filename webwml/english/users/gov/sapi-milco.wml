<p>
    Using exclusively Debian from 2004 in all services, migrating desktops in 
    2006, collaborating with the Free Software Community in Venezuela.
</p>    

<p>
    The Autonomous Service of Intellectual Property (SAPI) is a government
    office in Venezuela which registers trademarks and invention patents in
    the country (SAPI doesn't accept patents on software, nor 
    hardware-embedded software, nor human beings) and generally works to
    improve the peoples' quality of life through free knowledge diffusion.
</p>

<p>
    In 2004, before the presidential decree on Free Software use was
    approved in Venezuela, SAPI started migrating their servers to
    GNU/Linux. We decided to use Debian over several other options including
    Gentoo, Red Hat/Fedora and Ubuntu because of the robustness, scalability
    and general ease-of-use for the daily administration.
</p>    

<p>
    Servers migrated included HP ProLiant ML 110/350/570 servers, a Compaq
    Alphaserver DS20 and several IBM ThinkCentre. Services provided include
    external mail (supporting secure mail transactions and webmail),
    transparent proxy, firewalls, IDS, web-apps pool, DNS, webserver,
    databases server, SAN and several other applications. Currently SAPI is
    starting the migration of 150 desktops (mostly IBM Thinkcentres and
    Compaq Evo's) after a one-year term of Free Software use over
    proprietary platforms (namely, OpenOffice.org and Mozilla solutions) and
    one HP 9000 server running a 4GL-written program in Informix and a
    Compaq 3000 holding a directory.
</p>

<p>
    SAPI is trying to pay back at the Free Software Community by hosting the
    servers for SOLVE (Software Libre Venezuela) several community events
    (like the Caracas Trollparty 2006) and a mirror of Free Software
    applications. Plans include a CD with Free Software for free selling in
    the streets and the release of all systems in a Subversion server.
