<p>
    We are using Debian as our server's operating system. This includes services 
    such as: Apache, Postfix + Spamassassin + Amavis, PostgreSQL database + 
    PostGIS, MySQL database, Docker, Geoserver, etc. Also, we have installed 
    Debian on some desktop machines with graphical desktop environment.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because of its great stability and long term support. We 
    also use Debian because it has received great reviews as a server solution. 
    We also use Debian because it's free and open.
