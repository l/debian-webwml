#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on three proxy servers (Squid and SquidGuard), on two 
    firewalls (iptables), two SMTP servers (with Postfix and SpamAssassin) and 
    on several of the IT employees' laptops.
</p>

<p>
    We use Debian because it is more stable and secure than Microsoft Windows, 
    and more flexible and updated that RedHat.
