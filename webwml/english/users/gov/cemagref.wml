#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian for our mail hubs. Postfix/Clamav/spamassassin/SQLGrey filter 
    all mails for all our ten research centers.  We have two servers running for
    these tasks, and we chose Debian for its safety and stability.  In a few 
    weeks we'll migrate all this under Debian Squeeze on two virtual machines.  
    Debian is also used for our main DNS servers (again, two servers for all 
    research centers), and for the outgoing SMTP service.
