   /users/ - Debian Users
   ======================

 Below this directory you will find the various users of Debian:

com - commercial users
edu - educational users
gov - government users
org - organizational users

 Each file in these directories will create a link from the /users/ page,
showing the content of the <pagetitle> tag.  BE CAREFUL - the <pagetitle>
is added verbatim, that means it MUST NOT contain any 8bit characters (in
the english tree) because these titles are put into the translated pages
when there is no translation of the file itself and create wrong
characters.

 AGAIN: DO NOT put any 8BIT CHARACTERS into the <pagetitle>.


  Keeping data up to date
