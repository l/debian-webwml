   /users/ - Debian Users
   ======================

 Below this directory you will find the various users of Debian:

com - commercial users
edu - educational users
gov - government users
org - organizational users

 Each file in these directories will create a link from the /users/ page,
showing the content of the <pagetitle> tag.  BE CAREFUL - the <pagetitle>
is added verbatim, that means it MUST NOT contain any 8bit characters (in
the english tree) because these titles are put into the translated pages
when there is no translation of the file itself and create wrong
characters.

 AGAIN: DO NOT put any 8BIT CHARACTERS into the <pagetitle>.


  Keeping data up to date
  =======================

Current (manual) process data in ping.data.

Proposed initial mail

Subject: Are you still using Debian?

Hi [Name, if known],

Some time ago, you provided a description [1] of how your organization
uses Debian.

    1: [Link to the page and a copy of the current description]

If you are still using Debian, you may wish to update this data, with
a paragraph or two describing how your organization uses Debian. Try
to include details such as the number of workstations/servers, the
software they run (no need to specify version), and why you chose
Debian over the competition.

>> [If it's not already provided under the preferred form]
++++++++++++++++
Could you please provide us the name of your organization in the form
of “division, organization, city/town (optional), country”?
oooooooooooooooo

I.e., can we add the city/town if accurate? 
++++++++++++++++

>> [One of the two following, depending if there is a link or not]
++++++++++++++++
Is the home page link [2] still correct?
oooooooooooooooo
The home page link [2] is now redirected [3], could you please provide
an updated one, or confirm that the last link [3] is correct?
oooooooooooooooo

    2: [Home page link]

Could you please provide a link from your website mentioning you're
using Debian?
----------------
You may also wish to provide a home page link if you have one, and if
so, please provide a link from your website mentioning you're using
Debian.
++++++++++++++++

Thanks in advance for you answer.

Regards

[The sender], for the Debian website
