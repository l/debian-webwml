#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  With the creation of the International Open Source Network Programme under 
  APDIP, we chose to migrate our main servers over to a Debian GNU/Linux 
  platform. The Internet servers provide web, e-mail and DNS services, while 
  our intranet server provides DHCP and web proxy services. Our choice of a 
  free/open source software solution has provided us with more features and 
  flexible solutions.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of the ease of administration, strong
  community support and the Debian Social Contract.
