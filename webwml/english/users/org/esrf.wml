<p>
    ESRF migrates from Centos 5 to Debian 6 in 2012, starting with the control 
    room's workstation, data analysis workstations and clusters.  For data 
    analysis Debian offers both the richest environment including the most used 
    software and libraries in our field of research, and a rock solid 
    distribution with security fixes.
