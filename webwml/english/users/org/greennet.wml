<p>
    We offer web and email hosting, web site development, connectivity, virtual 
    and managed servers, and co-location to individuals, activists, NGOs, 
    charities and businesses. Our setup consists of approximately twenty servers 
    and they all run Debian/GNU Linux.

<p>
    We appreciate the stability, security, and the ease of maintenance of this 
    distribution. But we also subscribe to the political and social motives 
    behind.
