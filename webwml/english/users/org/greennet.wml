<p>
    We offer web and email hosting, web site development, connectivity,
    virtual and managed servers, and co-location to individuals, activists,
    NGOs, charities and businesses. Our setup consists of approximately
    twenty servers and they all run Debian GNU/Linux.
</p>
<p>
    We appreciate the stability, security, and the ease of maintenance of
    this distribution.  And we subscribe to the political and social motives
    behind Debian and the wider Free software movement.
