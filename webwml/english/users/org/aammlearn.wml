<p>
    AAMM learning coop is a non profit organization that provides a location 
    where physicians, medical students, and others can freely exchange 
    information that teaches or tests knowledge in the medical arts and 
    sciences.

<p>
    We use Debian to host a LAMP server.  We also use Debian (desktop version) 
    to generate content.  Debian is a very robust system.  We have had 
    unprecedented uptime.  Also it is very secure.  Debian also affords a very 
    user friendly update tool.  It is a rock solid distribution that is easy to 
    use and implement.
