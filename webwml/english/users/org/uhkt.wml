<p>
  Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion is an organization for
  treatment and research of maladies connected with hematogenous cells
  (like leukaemia) and lots of other blood diseases. We use x86-based
  Debian servers to host databases, file shares, and our
  corporate intranet applications as well as to provide infrastructure
  services such as mail relay, web proxy, and NAT. We also use x86 Debian
  desktops as replacement W** desktop on several positions in the institute.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian GNU/Linux because of Debian's great package management, 
  stability, and the Debian community.
