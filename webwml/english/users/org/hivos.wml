<p>
    The organisation uses Debian GNU/Linux on half of their servers, i.e.
    about 10 systems.
</p>
 
<p>
    It is used for two web servers, for the mail server and on a system
    for project administration, running a Firebird database.  Debian was
    chosen since it's the ultimate form of Open Source, and reliable as
    well.  Since Hivos works for creating a better world, fights poverty
    and uses <q>No Borders for People</q> as its motto, choosing Debian is
    natural.
