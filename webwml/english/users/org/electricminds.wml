<p>
  Our virtual community, which has been in operation since 1996, now
  runs on a Debian GNU/Linux server (replacing what was originally a
  Sun Enterprise server, then a slew of Windows NT Server boxes).
  Debian has been my favorite distro for some time now, and its ease
  of performing system updates combined with its ease of
  customization and its overall stability made it a natural choice
  for our community-purchased server.  The server runs our Web
  community software, the Venice Web Communities System
  <a href="http://venice.sourceforge.net">http://venice.sourceforge.net</a>,
  on top of Apache, Tomcat, and MySQL.
  </p>
<p>
  Nothing short of
  catastrophic disk failure has been able to take our server offline
  since it was deployed.  We're proud to display Debian's logo on
  our Acknowledgements page
