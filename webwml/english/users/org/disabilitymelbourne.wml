<p>
  We use Debian to provide dial-in access and a mail server for
  around 60 elderly and house-bound people in the Mornington
  Peninsula in the state of Victoria in Australia. One P133
  provides these services as well as acting as a firewall and a
  caching name server. A second box provides caching using Squid.
