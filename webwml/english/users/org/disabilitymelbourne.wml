#use wml::debian::users

<p>
Our purpose is to provide dial-in access and a mail server for
  around 60 elderly and house-bound people in the Mornington
  Peninsula in the state of Victoria in Australia.
</p>
<p>
Our three servers run Debian stable. The main software we use is Exim. 
We use one of these servers to connect our dial-in users to the web.
