#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    Our purpose is to provide dial-in access and email hosting for
    around 60 elderly and house-bound people in the Mornington 
    Peninsula area in the state of Victoria in Australia. Recently we have also 
    been able to provide services to some handicapped children for whom we 
    have provided laptops.
</p>
<p>
    We have three servers that run Debian stable. We use Apache and Exim 
    packages. We use one of the servers to connect our dial-in users to the 
    Internet.
