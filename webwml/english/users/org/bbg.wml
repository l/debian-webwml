#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Brooklyn Botanic Garden is a public garden and research institution.  We
  use x86-based Debian servers to host databases, file shares, and our
  corporate intranet applications as well as to provide infrastructure
  services such as mail relay, web proxy, and NAT.  We also use x86 and
  PowerPC-based Debian desktops in our IT Group and in our user training
  lab.
</p>
<p>
  We choose Debian GNU/Linux because of the Debian Social Contract, great
  package management, sensible defaults, stability, and the Debian
  community.
