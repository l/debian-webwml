#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  Brooklyn Botanic Garden is a public garden and research institution.  We
use x86-based Debian servers to provide infrastructure
services such as web proxy.  We also use x86
Debian desktops in our IT Group.
</p>
<p>
  We choose Debian GNU/Linux because of the Debian Social Contract, great
  package management, sensible defaults, stability, and the Debian
  community.
