#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    The person who is writing this made an official proposal to change all of 
    our computers, servers, desktop workstations, laptops, etc. in a period of 
    two or three years to Debian.  The proposal was accepted by the most of the 
    local trade unions from all over Spain.  The process began last year, and 
    many local federations have just changed to Debian or distros based on 
    Debian.

<p>
    Our goal is not only to change the organization's PCs to Debian, but all of 
    our affiliates' machines, too.  Our organization has about 60,000 members 
    and hundreds of locals with computers; we don't have exact numbers.  The 
    main uses of these machines are related to the offfice area: word 
    processors, web browsing, and a bit of multi media.

    We decided to choose Debian because Debian faithfully follows the GNU 
    spirit, because of the DFSG (it is and will be free software), and easy 
    maintenance with repositories of .deb packages, etc.
