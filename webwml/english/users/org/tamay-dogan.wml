<p>
    Tamay Dogan Network GmbH is Non-Profit Enterprise supported by the German 
    Government, UNDP and UNESCO. We are working in Germany, Iran, Turkey, 
    Morocco and Tunesia.  Our entire infrastucture is Debian-based since 1999.  
    We are using Apache2 with PHP5, ProFTPd, PostgreSQL, Courier, Fvwm, 
    IceApe/IceWeasel, OpenOffice and a bunch of developer tools.  Also I am 
    packing Debian packages for more than 6 years now.  We run the following 
    (dedicated) physical servers: 12 routers/firewalls, 23 PostgreSQL (smallest 
    2 GByte and biggest 1.8 TByte), 18 webservers, 7 Courier, 25 NFSv4, 1200 
    embedded telemetry systems (for solar power plants) and of course about 50 
    workstations in offices, 160 Workstations in Cybercafes.

<p>
    I started in March 1999 using Debian 2.1r5 Slink by switching away from 
    Windows NT 4.0 Server in a day-to-day operation and it just worked.  Because 
    of the enormeous stability, we have stayed for 10 years with Debian and 
    continue to do so.
