<p>
  CAcert uses Debian on about 10 physical servers and 20 virtual servers
  that are operating the CAcert services.
</p>
<p>
  At the time of our evaluation, Debian was the only distribution we found
  that fulfilled our security requirements by offering full-disk encryption
  right from the installation.
