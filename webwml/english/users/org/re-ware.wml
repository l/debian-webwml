<p>
    Reware Soc. Coop - Impresa Sociale, is a small not for profit cooperative 
    that sells refurbished computers. Three of its four workers use Debian on 
    their client for common tasks, and, of course, the server is Debian based. 
    Reware owns a shop where it sells refurbished computers with Debian, 
    Ubuntu and, rarely, proprietary OSs.

<p>
    The choice of Free Software is due to the fact that it fits with the strong
    ethical, social and environmental commitment of the founders and workers of 
    the organizzation. Not least is important, in the field of environmentally 
    oriented motivations, to underline the low system requirements of such an 
    OS, that help to extend the life cycle of electronic goods, reducing in such 
    a way its environmental impact, by postponing the moment when it becomes 
    waste.
