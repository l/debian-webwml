<p>
    ACAIS is a Portuguese non-profit organization with focus on the senior 
    population.  In 2011 we decided to migrate from Windows to Linux, 
    predominantly to Ubuntu and Linux Mint.  Later we changed to Debian, 
    because its principles of freedom matches better with our policy.

<p>
    We are mostly using Debian to work with productivity applications such as 
    LibreOffice, e-mailing and web searching.
