#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on four servers for the following purposes:  As a proxy and 
    firewall, Samba and NIS, database and intranet, backups and web development.
</p>

<p>
    We have have six workstations with graphical environment, OpenOffice as the 
    office suite, multimedia software, image editors, and web development tools. 
    Additionally we have seven workstations with Windows running twelve thin 
    clients with OpenOffice.
</p>

<p>
    We chose Debian because it is free software, for its stability, for its ease 
    to setup network servers, in order to work only with stable packages, and 
    because we believe in the Debian Project, and to support the use of free 
    software.
