#use wml::debian::users

<p>
We have chosen Debian GNU/Linux as our main desktop operating system for 
setting up two home offices. Two laptops are running classic GNOME-environments
 and XFCE. We also use: LibreOffice, Sylpheed, Icedove, Iceweasel, Scribus, 
Inkscape and GIMP.
</p>

<p>
We selected Debian as our first choice for a number of reasons. It is very 
practical and we have had a positive experience with Debian in our city 
councilor's office. We also wanted to support a genuinely independent project 
which reflects some of our own political ideas. For Debian's stability and 
security, and for cost savings on licensing fees.
