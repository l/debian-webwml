<p>
CARNet develops and maintains CARNet Debian, a distribution of the Debian
GNU/Linux operating system customized for the needs of CARNet members.
CARNet Debian enables CARNet member institutions with local
servers based on 32-bit or 64-bit technology to use automatic
installations and the adjustment of operating systems with
all Internet services important for the CARNet network.
</p>
<p>
The first version of CARNet Debian was made in 2002, it was
based on Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 and was successfully installed
in more than a hundred new Compaq ML330e servers in CARNet
member institutions throughout the Republic of Croatia.
The development of CARNet Debian continued in the following
years in order to follow the upstream editions of Debian.
Today, CARNet maintains a repository of customized Debian packages and offers
support for this software through its support service for system engineers.
