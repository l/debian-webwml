#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  CARNet has always been a proponent of open systems and has always
  used free software whenever it was applicable. Even on its Solaris
  systems, .deb is used as the preferred package format, the whole
  GNU tool set is packaged, and in fact switching to entirely free
  operating systems like GNU/Linux is perfectly allowed and welcomed.
</p>
<p>
  In the year 2002, a slightly customized version of Debian was made
  and deployed on over a hundred different servers, most of which are
  running multiple services and serving hundreds and thousands of
  users on academic institutions supported by CARNet throughout
  Croatia. CARNet maintains its own repository of customized .deb
  packages, provides support for Debian as the recommended GNU/Linux
  to be used by system administrators on the network, and plans to
  deploy even more Debian servers in the future.
