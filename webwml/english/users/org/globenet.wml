<p>
We are a non-profit organization, focusing on freedom of speech and
privacy, providing Internet services.
</p>
<p>
We use Debian on our servers (more than twenty now) since 1998 for its
excellent reliability, its great package management system, and its
security updates. Its commitment to free software and its
volunteer-based, not-for-profit operation are what we value the most.
