#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  I'm using Debian GNU/Linux on one i386 user server (doing
  IMAP, POP, Shell services etc). To this comes two Debian
  GNU/Linux SPARC servers hosting the LDAP, Kerberos and
  DNSSEC services for my network.
</p>
<p>
  On the Intel, the users authenticate/authorize against the
  LDAP/Kerberos setup (no users in traditional /etc/{passwd,shadow}
  etc). Using AFS (OpenAFS) for distributed storage of webdirectories,
  homedirectories etc guaranties availability and security
  of file services.
</p>
<p>
  Users can now (if need be) have access to their homedirectory
  at home securely through this encrypted network filesystem.
