<p>
I'm using Debian GNU/Linux on one primary storage server (hexacore
AMD Phenom II, 16GB memory) which <q>exports</q> disks: 16TB on
ZFS via Samba, NFS, iSCSI, AirVideoServer, AFP and DAAP.

A firewall, running from a USB
stick uses a heavily modified Debian Live with a dual 1Tb
network card for broadband and internal network connection.

The firewall is also responsible for internal NTP, DHCP and DNS
services, to simplify setting up a new machine.

Another server (AMD Athlon II, 8GB memory)
hosts all my virtual machines, running directly from
iSCSI on VirtualBox.
</p>
<p>
There is currently about 11 virtual machines running all
the time, most of them on Debian GNU/Linux,
used for development, testing, VoIP switching
(Astrix) etc.

User authentication and authorization is done using OpenLDAP and MIT
Kerberos V across the network.

All machines are headless, but a VNC server is running on the storage
server <q>just in case</q>.
</p>
<p>
I chose Debian GNU/Linux because of simplicity and extensive software
repository. You just can't beat over 6000 packages available! No matter the
need, chances of it being packaged and ready to run, after a simple
<q>apt-get install package</q>, is huge.
