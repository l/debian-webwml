<p>
    The SWITCH Foundation has operated the Swiss Education &amp; Research Network 
    since 1987, guaranteeing the universities access to the information society. 
    This high-performance network connects users in Switzerland with users all 
    over the world. Operating this network provides SWITCH with the necessary 
    know-how and technological foundation for running the registry for domain 
    names ending in .ch and .li.

<p>
    We have a variety of Linux distributions in use as server operating systems 
    - with Debian currently running on 140 servers. We not only appreciate the 
    stability and speed of the Debian OS, but also the efficient and smooth 
    packet administration as well as the quickly available security updates. 
    Distribution upgrades are easy to install. SWITCH will thus continue to use 
    Debian as default Linux distribution and will recommend it to its service 
    operators.
