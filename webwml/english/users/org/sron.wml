<p>
    SRON uses Linux extensively throughout the organization, running web 
    servers, file servers, and (scientific-) desktops.
</p>
<p>
    We've consolidated on Debian GNU/Linux for its stability, ease of 
    administration, slow release cycle and overall software compatibility. Apart 
    from the technical reasoning, there is also the political and structural: 
    Debian is non-profit and non-commercial. It cannot be bought or sold and 
    therefore we expect it to stay around for a long time to come.
</p>
<p>
    We have about 60 Linux workstations, of which 30 are running Debian. 
    Serverside, we have about 20 running Linux, of which 15 Debian. Our goal is 
    to switch all Linux and Solaris machines to Debian.
