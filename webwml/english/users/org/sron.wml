<p>
    SRON uses Linux extensively throughout the organization, running web 
    servers, file servers, and (scientific-) desktops.
</p>
<p>
    We've consolidated on Debian GNU/Linux for its stability, ease of 
    administration, slow release cycle and overall software compatibility. Apart 
    from the technical reasoning, there is also the political and structural: 
    Debian is non-profit and non-commercial. It cannot be bought or sold and 
    therefore we expect it to stay around for a long time to come.
</p>
<p>
    We have about 120 Linux workstations, running Debian Jessie 64-bit,
and some old 32-bit machines also running Debian.
    Serverside, we have about 20 running Linux, of which 15 Debian.
