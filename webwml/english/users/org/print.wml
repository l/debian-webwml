<p>
  PRINT is a squatted hacklab in Dijon, France.  We aim at: empowering people 
  through the use of recycled hardware and free software; sharing knowledge 
  &amp; skills through non-hierarchical workshops; granting open access to 
  the internet through our free-of-charge cybercaf&eacute;; encouraging alternative 
  content through participation in independent media structures; getting 
  geek and activist cultures to meet through our activities; drinking coffee 
  &amp;&amp; apt-get install anarchism &amp;&amp; make world.
</p>
<p>
  All our machines - be they firewalls, servers or client machines - run 
  Debian GNU/Linux. We mostly use the testing flavour, though sometimes 
  switching to sid, which often proved to be stable enough for our uses.
</p>
<p>
  We chose Debian for a number of reasons: not only do we find it technically 
  excellent for its clean design, its great package management system, the 
  number of architectures it supports and its security updates, but its 
  commitment to free software and its volunteer-based, not-for-profit 
  operation are what we value the most.
