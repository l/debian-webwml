#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    I installed Debian on one of our network's internal servers in order to 
    support our new calendaring suite, PHP Groupware. I chose to use Debian 
    because something was slowing our T1 down and the net-inst CD was much 
    faster than downloading all of the Red Hat Fedora Core CDs! Also, I'd 
    heard many good things about the distro and found it to be very hard to 
    break/easy to configure. On the down side, it took forever to get stuff 
    up and running due to a lack of good documentation. But on the part of 
    PHP, PHPGroupware, and mySQL. Debian's own docs were sound. Keep up the 
    good work!
