<p>
  CIPSGA is a non-governmental (non-profit) organization which works
  interfacing the statal companies (be them federal, statal or
  municipal) with the GNU community. During its first three years of
  existence, we have given tens of speeches, and supported the use
  of GNU software inside these businesses. Thanks to our work, we
  expect to have more than 25 thousand machines running Debian
  GNU/Linux in the next 12 months (servers and workstations.)
</p>
<p>
  Besides that, CIPSGA has placed 2 of the 8 Brazilian Debian
  Developers, which now work in statal companies supporting Debian
  GNU/Linux. We created a customization of Debian Woody meant to be
  used in schools, unions and other organizations. It consists of an
  application server with a semi-automated install procedure which
  requires only 4 simple steps to complete. We are creating a
  Debian-friendly scenario in Brazil, which is very likely to spread
  all over the country, in schools and in <q>Telecenters</q> that are
  being created to aid in the democratization of Internet access.
