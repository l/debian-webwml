    We love Debian 5 on our servers.  On our main server we have OpenVZ VPS and
    a second mirror server is running slices on VMware.  We are mostly using 
    MySQL as backend and Bacula for backup purposes.  We use Lightspeed for WWW 
    and Axigen for mail.

    Debian is our choice due to great packet administration and suberb stability.
    For us the system's stability is more important than other gizmos!  We are 
    glad to introduce Debian to the dynamic positioning offshore oil and gas 
    industry.
