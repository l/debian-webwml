  Information Network for The Third Sector is using Debian GNU/Linux on its 
  core network infrastructure since 2003. We're a ISP mainly for non-profit 
  organization's use of the Internet as a field for their activities, our 
  services for them includes: web hosting, colocated servers and consulting.

<p>
  We've decided to migrate all our GNU/Linux servers to Debian because of the
  goals of the project behind it and the good quality of the software and
  distribution management. This task is being made by Gustavo Franco, with
  support of our technical staff. Actually we've 20 servers running Debian
  GNU/Linux.
