<p>
  The organisation uses Debian as the first choice distribution on Linux 
  systems, and they are used in several areas:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    We have about 300 desktop machines, running Debian, for the use of 
    laboratory staff for mail, web browsing and so on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Our 500 node compute cluster consists of Xeon, EM64T and Opteron machines, 
    some running the i386 and some running the x86_64 ports of Debian.  The 
    cluster is used to run a variety of HPC applications, including the building 
    of the public <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> database of 
    genome information, medical research jobs, and even some computation fluid 
    dynamics for the development of in-house robots and so on.
  </li>
  <li>
    Debian is also used for many internal infrastructure services; mail, DNS, 
    NIS, DHCP and so on.
  </li>    
  <li>
    Many internal data servers are also larger machines running  
    Debian for running MySQL servers.  These are typically Opteron or  
    Itanium2 machines.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  There are three Debian Developers on the Systems team which helps.
