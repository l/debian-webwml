<p>
The organisation uses Ubuntu and Debian as the first choice distribution on Linux 
  systems, and they are used in several areas:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
We have about 80 desktop machines, running Debian or Ubuntu, for the use of 
laboratory staff for mail, web browsing, DNA sequence analysis and so on.
  </li>
  <li>
We have around 950 Debian/Ubuntu machines in HPC clusters.
These run a variety of HPC applications, including the IT
for the <a href="http://www.yourgenome.org/sc/">largest
DNA sequencing facility in Europe</a>, the building
    of the public <a href="http://www.ensembl.org/">Ensembl</a> database of 
genome information, epidemiological genetic research and many others.
Most of the software used for these studies are either standard bioinformatics
and statistical applications, or in-house research applications, many of which
are <a href="http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/">available for
download</a> mostly under open source licences.
  </li>
  <li>
Debian and Ubuntu are also used for many internal infrastructure services;
mail, LDAP etc.
Our entire web site runs on Debian or Ubuntu, most of it on virtual machines.
  </li>    
  <li>
    Many internal data servers are also larger machines running  
Debian for running MySQL servers.
  </li>
<li>
As of 27/04/2015: 190 Debian machines, 1557 Ubuntu machines.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There were a number of factors which led to our adoption of Debian (and later Ubuntu)
</p>
<ul>
<li>
First, the Debian and open source philosophy in
general fits very well with the Wellcome Trust's
<a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/About-us/Policy/Policy-and-position-statements/WTX035043.htm">policies</a>
to open access data to improve human and animal health worldwide.
</li>
<li>
Second, there are two Debian Developers on the Systems
team, so we have lots of in-house experience and expertise.
</li>
</ul>
