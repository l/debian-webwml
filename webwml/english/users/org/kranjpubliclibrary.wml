#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  For now we use Debian in our production environment only on our web server
  that hosts our web site, mail, DNS, groupware, CMS... It also hosts a few
  personal web sites of our employees. 
</p>
<p>
  We have chosen Debian because it has a marvelous package management system, 
  is relatively easy to install, very stable and completely free. Debian is 
  distribution of our choice when it comes to Linux, also in our testing 
  environment where we try to find and test solutions for our IT needs.
