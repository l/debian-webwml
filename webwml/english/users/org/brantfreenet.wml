#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  The Brant FreeNet is a non-profit Internet service provider. We use Debian 
  as our primary and secondary mailserver. We switched to Debian when our mail 
  server vendor upgraded their product and changed their pricing scheme to a 
  user-based charge that would not allow us to have the flexibility that we 
  need to manage our business.
</p>
<p>
  While the learning curve has been steep, we have managed to get our systems 
  fully integrated into a Win2k3 environment and the reliability of the system 
  has improved dramatically. Exim, Courier, and MailMan software have replaced 
  an expensive commercial package and performance has been enhanced. Certainly 
  our mail technical support to our end users has decreased dramatically.
