#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We use two Debian servers for our networking and file service 
  infrastructure. Within this infrastructure, our staff use both Windows and 
  Linux (Debian) workstations.  We chose Debian since it is a reliable and 
  customisable platform that allows us to control costs in a transparent way 
  and tailor our network services to our needs.
