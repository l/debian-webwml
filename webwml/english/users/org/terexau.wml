<p> 
Terex Australia uses Debian for routing, firewalls, proxy servers, support
systems, desktop machines, fileservers and various other tasks.
</p>
<p>
The main reason for choosing Debian over other distributions is the amazing
package-management mixed with ease-of-use and its ability to serve us so
well.
