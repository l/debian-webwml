<p>
    GSI is a German non-profit research lab that runs a heavy ion accelerator 
    and is part of the Helmholtz association.  The HPC department of GSI is 
    running a Linux <q>farm</q> with more than a 1000 nodes.  We primarily use 
    Debian for our Linux installation since the last millennium (around 1997).
</p>

<p>
    We have recently activated a 10,000 core compute cluster and 1.5 PB Lustre 
    storage with Infiniband-only networking running Debian Squeeze and managed 
    by GridEngine - on top of our existing ~5000 CPU core cluster with more than 
    2 PB Lustre storage.  Apart from our compute cluster we also provide some 
    hundred desktops, servers for data acquisition, central IT services and 
    collaboration web services with Debian.
</p>

<p>
    We profit a lot from the more than 2000 packages that we can simply pull 
    from the standard Debian repositories for our default desktop installation.
