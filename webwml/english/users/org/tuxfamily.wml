<p>
TuxFamily is a non-profit organization. It provides free services for 
projects and contents dealing with the free software philosophy (free as 
in free speech, not as in free beer). We accept any project released 
under a free license (GPL, BSD, CC-BY-SA, Art Libreâ€¦).
</p>
<p>
TuxFamily uses around 20 physical Debian servers on mixed amd64/i386 
architectures and around half dozen Debian running on virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
TuxFamily use Debian for more than 10 years now, most TuxFamily 
administrators are Debian-fanatics and perfectionists. All of them fond 
of the way that stable Debian releases are perfectly finished with all 
the love required to reach perfection.
