<p>
TuxFamily is a non-profit organization which provides free services for 
projects and contents dealing with the free software philosophy (free as 
in free speech, not as in free beer). It accepts any project released 
under a free license (GPL, BSD, CC-BY-SA, Art Libreâ€¦).
</p>
<p>
TuxFamily uses around 20 physical Debian servers on mixed amd64/i386 
architectures and around half dozen Debian running on virtual machines.
</p>
<p>
TuxFamily has used Debian for more than 15 years, most TuxFamily 
administrators are Debian-fanatics and perfectionists. All of them are 
fond of the way that stable Debian releases are perfectly finished with all 
the love required to reach perfection.
