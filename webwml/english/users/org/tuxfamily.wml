<p>
    Tuxfamily uses around 10 Debian servers on i386 architecture. All services 
    are redundant and load-balanced. These services are offered to people 
    wanting to develop anything free.
</p>

<p>
    Tuxfamily is involved in Debian (some administrators are Debian Developers)
    and everything dealing with freedom, not only Free Software but also free 
    art licensing.
