<p>
  SARA is one of the most advanced computing and networking centers in the
  Netherlands, offering High Performance Computing and -Networking (HPCN) and
  affiliated services, such as visualization, to the scientific community,
  educational institutes and industry.
</p>
<p>
  At the department High Performance Computing we chose to use Debian for all our
  Linux based systems. The main reason was the good implementation of
  tools (package management, simple creation of own packages) to do system installs
  and upgrades. The systems we maintain are: 
</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.sara.nl/userinfo/lisa/description/index.html">the
       national compute cluster Lisa</a> (available since November 2004)</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sara.nl/userinfo/grid/description/index.html">the
       NL-Grid cluster Matrix</a></li>
# <li>168 nodes, AMD(IA32) Beowulf cluster used by The University of Amsterdam(UvA)
#   (<a href="http://www.sara.nl/beowulf">http://www.sara.nl/beowulf</a>)</li>
# <li>16 nodes Compaq(Alpha) cluster used by various users</li>
# <li> 2 node, 4 CPU's per node IBM(IA64) cluster used for porting 32 bit software to 64 bit</li>
