<p>
  Galliera is a large Italian hospital with over 2,000 employees,
  and 2,000 devices on its LAN.
  We rely on our 14 Debian servers for our network infrastructure, 
  as hosts for virtualizing, as well as for office and Internet services. We 
  rely heavily on Debian for our VPN, routing and firewalling. In addition, 
  we also use Debian for some standard Internet services such as DNS, 
  web servers, and email. Finally, Debian servers provide us
  with a number of office services as well such as print queue
  management, fax and file servers.
</p>
<p>
  We choose to use Debian because of its stability, its package
  management system, as well as the strength of the Debian community.
