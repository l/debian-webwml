<p>
  Galliera is a large Italian hospital with over 1,700 employees,
  and 800 devices on its LAN.
  We rely on our 15 Debian servers for our network infrastructure, 
  as well as for office and Internet services. We depend heavily on 
  Debian for our VPN and our routing and firewalling. In addition, 
  we also use Debian for some standard Internet services such as DNS, 
  web servers, and email. Finally, Debian servers provide us
  with a number of office services as well such as print queue
  management, fax and file servers.
</p>
<p>
  We choose to use Debian because of its stability, its package
  management system, as well as the strength of the Debian community.
