#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have installed Debian on about 30 servers, running services like samba,
  bind, dhcp, ftp, mail (qmail), www, database (oracle, mysql and postgres)
  and backup (via rsync and arkeia). We also have about 40 Debian desktop
  workstations, used primarily for development and office tools.
</p>
<p>
  We use Debian because of its simplicity; and because it works that stable!
