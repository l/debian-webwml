<p>
Southold Free Library is located on the North Fork of Long Island, in <q>Wine
Country</q>. I chose Debian to run our web and network server, and will soon be
  using it to run out wireless network. 
</p>
<p>
  We proudly run Debian GNU/Linux because of the Debian Social Contract, great
  package management, security, sensible defaults, stability, completely free,
  as well as the strength of the Debian community.
