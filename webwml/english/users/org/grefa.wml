#use wml::debian::users

<p>
    We use Debian on our servers for intranet infrastructure (dns, dhcp, 
    firewalls, ...), as web applications server with apache, php, mysql and 
    postgresql/postgis.  We also use motion for web cams.  Furthermore we use 
    Debian to develop veterinary and biology applications.  On desktops we use 
    Quantum-Gis and R to study the animal movements we get from the PPT's from 
    Argos.  We also use libreoffice, gimp, scribus, iceweasel, icedove, etc.
    Debian is installed on 5 servers and on 5 workstations.
</p>

<p>
    We use Debian because of its quality.  Also because it is free, but quality 
    is more important to us.
