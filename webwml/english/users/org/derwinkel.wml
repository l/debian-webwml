<p>
  Information center for tolerance and against right-wing extremism and violence
</p>
<p>
  The Belziger Forum e.V. has operated the
  info cafe "Der Winkel" since 1998 as a meeting point for different
  ethnic communities.
  The facilities include two to five PCs (depending on demand and
  available resources), that can be used to connect to the Internet or
  for other purposes (games, videos).
</p>
<p>
  In additional to their own Internet presence the association is currently
  creating a homepage about a former concentration camp
  (http://aussenlager-roederhof.de). We have a notebook with Debian
  and Windows for creating the homepage (the scanner is not working with the
  current Debian stable, that's why the Windows).
</p>
<p>
  We use the Debian stable release.
  Installed software: Apache2, Chromium browser, Epiphany, gedit, gthumb,
  Iceweasel, Inkscape, Marble, MYSQL, OpenOffice.org, OpenSSH server, PHP,
  Rhythmbox, VideoLAN, XScreenSaver, VirtualBox.
</p>
<p>
  Why Debian?
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  Stable, crashes extremely rarely;
  </li>
  <li>
  no viruses;
  </li>
  <li>
  good security;
  </li>
  <li>
  easy to administrate (including remotely);
  </li>
  <li>
  no unnecessary fundamental changes (as seen in Microsoft products);
  functionality is added, but things that have worked in the past also
  work after the changes;
  </li>
  <li>
  very good documentation;
  </li>
  <li>
  quick help in case of problems (e.g. via ask.debian.net).
  </li>
</ul>
