<p>
    Debian is currently being used on workstations and will soon be running our
    servers. The Custer Institute's Research Team is doing a study of exoplanets
    (detecting planets orbiting distant stars). The network backbone of this
    project will be run on Debian servers. In addition to these servers,
    currently serveral staff members and volunteers are already running Debian
    on their personal laptops/PCs. Debian is helping us to better understand
    our universe.
