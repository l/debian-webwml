#use wml::debian::users

<p>
  We have been using Debian for more than 6 years, and we donate PCs with Debian 
  installed on them.  We are a volunteer organisation which helps disadvantaged 
  individuals and groups.
</p>

<p>
  The reason why we use Debian is its stability and the ability to install on 
  old machines of which we receive heaps donated by different organisations.
