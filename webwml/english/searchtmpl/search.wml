# Hello translator people!!
#
# This file just includes the data and definition files for the real content.
# For you to make search.<yourlang>.html put this file in 
# webwml/<yourlang>searchtmpl and edit webwml/english/searchtmpl/search.def
# doing the usual slices thing.
# You may need to create the searchtmpl directory and edit the top-level
# Makefile.
# Of course edit the blurb below (in your language directory) to suit.
# Email debian-www@lists.debian.org if you want to understand how this
# horror works.

#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/searchtmpl/search.data"

<p>You can use the form below to search through most of the Debian web site.

<p>Notice that we have separate search pages for those looking
for <A href="http://packages.debian.org/">packages</A>, 
<A href="http://lists.debian.org/search.html">mailing list posts</A> or
<A href="http://bugs.debian.org/">bug reports</A>.

<p>Dual byte languages have some support, but still do not work as well
as they should. We are working on getting this problem fixed soon.</p>
