<p>
There are a <a href="#list">number of distributions</a> based on Debian.
Some people might want to take a look at these distributions <em>in addition to</em> the official Debian releases.
</p>

<p>
A Debian derivative is a distribution that
is based on the work done in Debian but
has its own identity, goals and audience and
is created by an entity that is independent from Debian.
Derivatives modify Debian to achieve the goals they set for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Debian welcomes and encourages organisations that want to develop new distributions based on Debian.
In the spirit of Debian's <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>,
we hope derivatives will contribute their work to Debian and upstream projects,
so that everyone can benefit from their improvements.
</p>

<h2>Why derive from Debian?</h2>

<p>
It can be faster to modify an existing distribution like Debian than starting from scratch since
a packaging format, repositories, base packages and other things are specified and usable.
A lot of software is packaged so there is no need to spend time packaging most things.
This allows derivatives to focus on the needs of a specific audience.
</p>

<p>
Debian ensures that what we distribute is <a href="$(HOME)/intro/free">free</a>
for derivatives to modify and redistribute to their audience.
We do this by checking the licenses of software we distribute
against the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Debian has a number of different <a href="$(HOME)/releases/">release</a> cycles
available for derivatives to base their distribution on.
This allows derivatives to
try <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianExperimental">experimental</a> software,
move really <a href="$(HOME)/releases/unstable/">fast</a>,
update <a href="$(HOME)/releases/testing/">often</a> with quality assurance,
have a <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">solid base</a> for their work,
use <a href="https://backports.debian.org/">newer</a>
software on top of a solid base,
enjoy <a href="$(HOME)/security/">security</a> support and or
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">extend</a> that support.
</p>

<p>
Debian supports a number of different <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">architectures</a>
and contributors are <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianBootstrap">working</a>
on methods of automatically creating new ones for new processor types.
This allows derivatives to use the hardware of their choice
or to support new processor designs.
</p>

<p>
The Debian community and people from existing derivatives are available
and willing to help guide new distributions in their work.
</p>

<p>
Derivatives are created for a number of reasons, such as
translation to new languages,
specific hardware support,
different installation mechanisms or
supporting a particular community or group of people.
</p>

<h2>How to derive from Debian?</h2>

<p>
Derivatives can use parts of Debian's infrastructure if needed (like repositories).
Derivatives should change references to Debian (like the logo, name, etc.)
and to Debian services (like the website and BTS).
</p>

<p>
If the goal is to define a set of packages to install,
creating a <a href="$(HOME)/blends/">Debian blend</a>
could be an interesting way to do that within Debian.
</p>

<p>
Detailed development information is available in the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines">guidelines</a> and
guidance is available from the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">front desk</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why is Debian interested in derivatives?</h2>

<p>
Derivatives bring Debian to a larger number of people with more diverse
experiences and requirements than the audience we currently reach.
By developing relationships with derivatives,
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Integration">integrating</a>
information about them into Debian infrastructure and
merging changes they have made back into Debian, we
share our experience with our derivatives,
expand our understanding of our derivatives and their audiences,
potentially expand the Debian community,
improve Debian for our existing audience and
make Debian suitable for a more diverse audience.
</p>

<h2>Why use a derivative instead of Debian?</h2>

<p>
If you have a specific need which is better served by a derivative,
you might prefer using it instead of Debian.
</p>

<p>
If you are part of a specific community or group of people and
there is derivative that is for that group of people,
you might prefer using it instead of Debian.
</p>

<h2 id="list">Which derivatives are available?</h2>

<p>
There are a number of distributions based on Debian listed in the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">Debian derivatives census</a>
as well as in <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives#Lists">other places</a>.
</p>

<p>
In addition, we would like to highlight the following Debian derivatives:
</p>

## Please keep this list sorted alphabetically
<ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>:
      security auditing and penetration testing.
      <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Kali">More info</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://pureos.net/">Purism PureOS</a>:
##    FIXME: insert sentence about Purism
      <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census/Purism">More info</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://tails.boum.org/">Tails</a>:
      preserve privacy and anonymity.

    </li>
</ul>

## Examples of these criteria are in the accompanying README.txt
<p>
The derivatives highlighted above have each met most of these criteria:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>actively cooperate with Debian</li>
    <li>are actively maintained</li>
    <li>have a team of people involved, including at least one Debian member</li>
    <li>have joined the Debian derivatives census and included a sources.list in their census page</li>
    <li>have a distinguishing feature or focus</li>
    <li>are notable and established distributions</li>
</ul>
