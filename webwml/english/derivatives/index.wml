There are a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">number of distributions</a> based on Debian.
Some users might want to take a look at these distributions <em>in addition to</em> the official Debian releases.
</p>

<p>
Debian welcomes and encourages organisations that want to develop new distributions based on Debian.
In the spirit of Debian's <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>,
we hope derivatives will contribute their work to Debian and upstream projects,
so that everyone can benefit from their improvements.
</p>

<p>
A derivative is a distribution created by an independant entity from Debian, where the packages are based on Debian ones. The derivative distribution has his own name and add others packages or modify some of them to achieve the goal of the entity.
</p>

<h2>Why derive from Debian?</h2>

<p>
It can be faster to modify an existing distribution like Debian than starting from scratch since
a packaging format, repositories, base packages and other things are specified and usable.
A lot of software is packaged so there is no need to spend time packaging most things.
This allows derivatives to focus on the needs of a specific audience.
</p>

<p>
The Debian community and people from derivatives are available
and willing to help guide new distributions in their work.
</p>

<p>
Derivatives are created for a number of reasons
(better localization support, specific hardware support, simplified installation,etc.).
</p>

<p>
Choosing Debian as basis for a new derivative is a good choice because Debian:
    <ul>
        <li>takes care of the software licences</li>
        <li>packages a lot of software</li>
        <li>supports a lot of processor architectures</li>
        <li>has a stable and a testing version so derivative can choose which one he should use according his goal</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>How to derive from Debian?</h2>

<p>
Derivatives can use parts of Debian's infrastructure if needed (like repositories).
Derivatives should change references to Debian (like the logo, name, etc.)
and to Debian services (like the website and BTS).
</p>

<p>
If the goal is to define a set of packages to install,
creating a <a href="$(HOME)/blends/">Debian blend</a>
could be an interesting way to do that within Debian.
</p>

<p>
Detailed development information is available in the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines">Derivatives wiki
guidelines</a> and guidance is available from the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">Derivatives wiki front desk</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why choosing a Debian Derivative instead of vanilla Debian?</h2>

<p>
If you have a specific need which is better matched by a Debian Derivative, you could prefer using it instead of Debian.
Feel free to contribute to the derivative or help them to push back the addable improvements to Debian.
</p>

<p>
Please do not request us to add a derivative to the Census without their will. Perhaps the derivative does not want to be added and we respect their choice.
If you are not involved in the Debian derivative that you would like to see added to the census, please consider sending an invitation to join the census to a contact point of the derivative you would like to see added to the census.
</p>

<h2>Why Debian package developers should be interrested in derivatives?</h2>

<p>
Modifications and improvements available in Debian Derivatives are easier to reintegrate into Debian compared to others source because the patch are in the right format and can be watched automaticaly by Debian. It's done with a script comparing packages (more info in the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Integration">Derivatives wiki</a>). Debian maintainers have to watch the patches and decide if they are worth adding them back to Debian.
