#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Software distributions derived from Debian" BARETITLE=true

<p>There are a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/CensusFull">
number of distributions</a> based on Debian. Some users might want
to take a look at these distributions <em>in addition to</em> the official
Debian releases.</p> <p>Debian welcomes and encourages organisations
that want to develop new distributions based on Debian. However, in
the spirit of Debian's <a href="https://www.debian.org/social_contract">
social contract</a>, we ask them to contribute their work to the main
distribution so that ultimately, all users can benefit from improvements.</p>

<h2>Why deriving from Debian?</h2>

<p>It's faster to modify an existing distribution like Debian than
starting from scratch : a packaging format, repositories, packages
base, etc. are specified and usable immediately. A lot of softwares
are packaged so there are no need to waste time to package them. This
allows derivatives to focus on the specific add-ons.</p>

<p>Derived distributions are done for a number of reasons (better
localization support, specific hardware support, simplified
installation, etc.).</p>

<p>If the goal is only defining a set of packages to install, creating
a <a href="/blends/">Debian blend</a> could be a better choice than
creating a derivative.</p>

<h2>Instructions for creating derivatives</h2>

<p>Derivatives can use part of Debian's infrastructure if needed (like
repositories). Derivatives have to change direct references to Debian
(like the logo, the name, etc.) and the links interfering to Debian'
services (like popcon).</p>

<p>Detailed development informations are available on the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Guidelines">wiki pages</a>.</p>
