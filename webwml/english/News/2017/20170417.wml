<p>
The Debian Project is concerned to hear that one of our members,
Dmitry Bogatov, has been arrested by Russian authorities.
</p>

<p>
Dmitry is a mathematics teacher, and an active Debian contributor.
As a Debian Maintainer, he worked in the Debian Haskell group
and currently maintains several packages for  command line
and system tools.
</p>

<p>
We await further details of the case against him,
but hope that he receives fair treatment and due process.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, the Debian Project has taken measures to secure
its systems by removing Dmitry's keys in the case
that they are compromised.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication
to Debian and Free Software, and we hope he is back
as soon as possible to his endeavours.
</p>

<p>
We send our full support to him and his family.
