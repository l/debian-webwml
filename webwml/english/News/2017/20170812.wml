Today, Saturday 12 August 2017, the annual Debian Developers

With over 405 people attending from all over the world
(see the <a href="https://annex.debconf.org/debconf-share/debconf17/photos/aigarius/debcond17%20group%20photo.jpg">DebConf17 group photo</a>),
and 169 events including 89 talks, 61 discussion sessions or BoFs,
6 workshops and 13 other activities, 
<a href="https://debconf17.debconf.org">DebConf17</a> has been hailed as a success.
</p>

<p>
Highlights included DebCamp with 117 participants,
the <a href="https://debconf17.debconf.org/news/2017-08-05-open-day/">Open Day</a>,

has been updated every day, including 32 ad-hoc new activities, planned
by attendees during the whole conference.
