<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the first update of its
stable distribution Debian <release> (codename <q><codename></q>). 
This point release mainly adds corrections for security issues,
along with a few adjustments for serious problems.  Security advisories
have already been published separately and are referenced where available.</p>

<p>Please note that the point release does not constitute a new version of Debian
<release> but only updates some of the packages included.  There is
no need to throw away old <q><codename></q> media. After installation,
packages can be upgraded to the current versions using an up-to-date Debian
mirror.</p>

<p>Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages, and most such updates are
included in the point release.</p>

<p>New installation images will be available soon at the regular locations.</p>

<p>Upgrading an existing installation to this revision can be achieved by
pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at:</p>
