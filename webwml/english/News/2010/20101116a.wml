<p>
The Debian Women project is pleased to announce the forthcoming start of a 
series of training sessions which will be held on IRC by experienced community
members. The main goal of this initiative is to encourage more people, and
specifically women, to contribute to Debian while introducing them to
different aspects of the Debian Project. Topics will span over a wide range
of subjects related to daily Debian maintenance efforts as well as advanced tasks.
These sessions are organized by the Debian Women project on its IRC channel
(#debian-women on irc.debian.org) and are open to everybody, regardless of
gender or previous involvements in the community.
</p>

<p>
First session has been scheduled for Thursday, 18th November at 20:00 UTC. 
Lars Wirzenius, a long-standing Debian Developer, will give an introductory
lesson titled <q>Introduction to Debian Packaging</q>.
</p>

<p>
Future sessions will be held on a regular basis, and will cover collaborative
maintenance with Git, Python modules and applications packaging, and many more.

href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianWomen/TrainingSessions">wiki page</a> regularly
to check the up-to-date agenda and follow <a

You may also refer to the wiki to suggest new topics or sign up yourself as a 
trainer: we are always looking for more people to share knowledge and complete 
the schedule, so don't be shy!
