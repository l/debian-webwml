<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of the
largest and most influential open source projects.
Over three thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to
create
and maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>

<h2>About MiniDebConf</h2>

<p>As the name suggests, a MiniDebConf is a smaller version of DebConf.
DebConf is the annual Debian Developers' conference.  Like DebConf, a
MiniDebConf features a full schedule of technical, social and policy
talks.  This provides another chance in the year for developers,
contributors and other interested people to meet in person and work
closely together.  MiniDebConfs have taken place in many locations on
five continents over the last decade.  The location of this conference in
Ho Chi Minh City makes it fit perfectly with this year's DebConf on the
opposite side of the planet, in New York, thus maximising our planetary
coverage.</p>
