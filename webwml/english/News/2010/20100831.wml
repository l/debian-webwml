<p>The Debian Project has lost a member of its community. Frans Pop (fjp)
died on August 20th.</p>

<p>Frans was involved in Debian as a maintainer of several packages, a
supporter of the S/390 port, and one of the most involved members of the
Debian Installer team. He was a Debian Listmaster, editor and release
manager of the Installation Guide and the release notes, as well as a
Dutch translator.</p>

<p>The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software.  Frans' broad technical knowledge and his
ability to share that knowledge with others will be missed.  The
contributions of Frans will not be forgotten, and the high standards
of his work will continue to serve as an inspiration to others.</p>
