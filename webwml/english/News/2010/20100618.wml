<h2>Bug Squashing Party</h2>

<p>In order to help Debian towards the release of Squeeze, a Bug Squashing Party
will be held during LSM/RMLL.</p>

<p>Even if you are not a Debian developer, as long as you are interested in
helping Debian to get all the open release-critical bugs fixed, you're welcome
at the BSP. There will be enough developers around to sponsor your NMUs. </p>

<p>There are some more information about <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~vorlon/rc-bugsquashing.html">BSPs</a> and <a

<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>
