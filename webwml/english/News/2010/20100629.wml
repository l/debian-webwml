#use wml::debian::news

<p>The Debian Project has been promoting software freedom and delivering Free
Software to users via its releases since 1993, when it was one of the first
GNU/Linux distributions ever.  It has spawned <a
href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/iamurdock/3950212995/sizes/l/">several
distributions</a> which are nowadays based on the work done in Debian, as
allowed and encouraged by Free Software customs.  Such distributions are
colloquially referred to as <q>derivatives</q>; according to <a
href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a>, Debian currently enjoys more
than 120 derivatives, including some of the most popular GNU/Linux
distributions currently available.</p>

<p>The Debian Project encourages other distributions to base themselves on the
volunteer work of Debian Developers and believes that it is through
inter-distribution collaborative activities such as bug forwarding, joint
maintenance teams, patch forwarding, etc. that Free Software is best
served.</p>

<p>To that end, the Debian Project is happy to announce the opening of its <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">Derivatives Front Desk</a>,
a forum where contributors to Debian-based distributions can meet and discuss
the best ways to push their changes back to Debian or otherwise ask for help on
how to interact with Debian development.</p>

<p>Developers of Debian-based distributions are hereby invited to join the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/">debian-derivatives@lists.debian.org</a>
mailing list as the main discussion forum for derivatives. Additionally, the
Debian Project encourages contributors of Debian-based distributions to mail
inquiries about how to contribute back their changes to <a
href="mailto:derivatives@debian.org">derivatives@debian.org</a>.</p>


<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>
