<p>To register follow one of the processes outlined below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you registered for DebConf7, DebConf8, or DebConf9, log in at <a href="https://penta.debconf.org/penta/submission/dc10/person">https://penta.debconf.org/penta/submission/dc10/person</a></li>
  <li>If you did not register for any of the past three DebConfs you need a new
   account in the conference management system. First go to <a
   href="https://penta.debconf.org/penta/user">https://penta.debconf.org/penta/user</a>
   and create an account. After visiting the activation URL sent to you by
email, log in at <a
href="https://penta.debconf.org/penta/submission/dc10/person">https://penta.debconf.org/penta/submission/dc10/person</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>After logging in</h2>

<p>After logging in, please fill in at least the <q>General</q>,
<q>Contact</q> and <q>Travelt</q> tabs reachable through the
<q>Registration details</q> button on the bar on the left of the page.
Please pay special attention to the <q>DebConf</q> and <q>DebCamp</q> boxes on the
<q>General</q> tab. You need to select at least the <q>I want to attend this
conference</q> checkbox or your registration won't be valid.</p>

<p>Note to users who have an account from previous years: We did our best to
make sure you do not have to re-enter all your personal data again, just
the conference-specific changes. But please check carefully whether the
data kept from your previous registration is still valid, and update it if
appropriate.</p>

<p>After making changes in the conference management system, please reload
the page from the server to check that your changes were properly recorded
&mdash; a few attendees have had trouble with certain web browsers not
uploading the data they had entered.</p>
