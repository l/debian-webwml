<p>DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a full
schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides an opportunity
for developers, contributors and other interested people to meet in person and
work together. It has taken place annually since 2000 in locations as varied as
Canada, Finland, Mexico, Scotland, and Argentina. This year DebConf10 is in New
York City, New York, USA.</p>

<p>This year, as every year, a great deal of the burden for the conference is
placed on Debian volunteers who donate time and energy to organizing the
conference. Your help would be most welcome. If you are interested in
volunteering, you can contact debconf-team [at] lists.debian.org.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can help DebConf10 by donating money which will be used to
enable those Debian contributors who currently cannot attend due to funding
shortage. You can contribute money by either becoming a sponsor (if you are a
company) or donating money as an individual.</p>

<p>As Raphael Geissert wrote on his blog: <q>DebConf10 needs your help!  That's
right: it needs help from potential sponsors and donors to help cover the costs
implied by this event. If you are interested in becoming a sponsor please
contact sponsors [at] debconf.org, or if you want to make a donation please
visit the DebConf10 <a
href="http://debconf10.debconf.org/payments.xhtml">donations
page.</a></q></p>

<p>Companies or organizations can, in addition to money donation, lend equipment
for the conference.</p>

<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>
