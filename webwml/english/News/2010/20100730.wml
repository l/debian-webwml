system, would like to invite you to participate in the upcoming Debian
Conference which will take place from August 1 to 7, 2010, at New York
City's Columbia University in cooperation with the Columbia Computer
Science department. This year's conference is the first DebConf to be held
in the United States in the 11-year history of the event. This year, more
than 300 developers from all over the world, including Brazil, Argentina,

<p>Every year, DebConf allows new and existing Debian project
participants from around the world to assemble, share knowledge and
ideas, make collaborative contributions to Debian, and build tighter
community bonds. Conference costs are largely supported by corporate
sponsors who find significant interest in supporting Debian and
DebConfs.</p>

<p>For the first time, Debconf will host <q>tracks</q>, featuring a cluster
of talks linked by a common theme. These include tracks on Science/Math,
Java, Enterprise Systems, Debian Community Outreach, and Media and Art in
Debian. Other talks will cover technical, licensing, and community issues
by a host of Debian developers and other leaders in the Free Software
community. Eben Moglen, Chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center and
Professor of Law at Columbia University will be our <a

conference opens its doors to anyone interested in finding out more
about Debian and Free Software. During this event, there will be a
full day of talks on a variety of subjects such as Free Software
advocacy, Free Software usability, and a number of talks on the Debian
project and operating system itself.  One of the hilights of this year's
