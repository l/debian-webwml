<p>Today, the Debian project administrators are activating a new cdbuilder
server. The server computes the official Debian ISO images once all
software packages are ready for a new Debian release. While the old system
needed 20 hours to build the ISOs, the new server needs less than two hours
for the same job.</p>

<p>Debian users download ISO images and burn them on CD or DVD to create
their Debian installation media. <q>Building ISO images in a fast way is a
critical task for every Debian release. Once all the packages are ready,
everyone is waiting for the new ISO images to become available. With over
25.000 packages for twelve computer architectures this is a very
challenging task,</q> says Steve McIntyre, Debian Project Leader.</p>

<p>Debian's new SC846 server from Thomas Krenn utilizes two Intel&reg;
Xeon&reg; Processors E5540 to compute the ISO images, which get written to
an high-performance RAID array. The array uses 24 Toshiba 15k SAS disks,
connected to an Adaptec ASR5445Z controller. After the ISO images have been
created, they are copied to multiple mirror servers where they can be
downloaded by Debian users. <q>On the old system, we would expect to take
roughly 20 hours for a full build for all architectures. The new system is
much more powerful and will allow us to do much more work in parallel,
reducing that time to less than 2 hours. That will make a huge difference
when we come to make the next Debian release,</q> explains Steve
McIntyre.<p>

<p>Max Wittenzellner, supervisory board chairman of Thomas-Krenn.AG, explains
why his company supports the Debian project: <q>Many of our customers use
Debian for critical IT services, and so do we. As we benefit a lot from
Debian and the whole Open Source community, we want to give something back,
too.</q></p>

<p>With this new hardware the Debian project has enough computing power to
build the ISOs of the upcoming release squeeze reliably and in a timely
manner. Even in case of an unexpected power loss all data including
RAID-cache is proteced, thanks to Adaptec Zero Maintenance Cache Protection
(ZMCP). Debian thanks Thomas-Krenn.AG, Intel and Adaptec for donating this
server.</p>
