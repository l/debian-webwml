<p>In accordance with its <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">
constitution</a> the Debian Project has elected Stefano
Zacchiroli as Debian project leader for the 2010/2011 term. Stefano has
been a Debian Developer since March 2001 and is a long-term contributor to
several core services such as Debian's Package Tracking System and its
Quality Assurance Team. Upon his election win he said: <q>I can't be more
proud of being a member of the Debian project.  The number of developers
which took part in our democratic election process &ndash; as candidates,
voters, and campaigning participants &ndash; makes me really happy. I'm also a
bit scared now, rest assured that I'll do my best to be up to the
expectations of all Debian contributors.</q></p>

<p>The outgoing project leader, Steve McIntyre, was first elected in 2008.
After serving for two years, Steve chose not to run for a third term.
Steve congratulates Stefano: <q>I've had a great time working for Debian as
DPL and I'm more than happy to be handing over the reigns to Stefano. He
has excellent ideas and should do a good job for us.</q> The Debian project
would like to thank Steve for his great work and constant commitment
to the project.</p>

<p>The candidates for this year's election were Stefano Zacchiroli, Wouter
Verhelst, Charles Plessy and Margarita Manterola. After a six week election
period the Debian project chose  Stefano Zacchiroli to be its next project
leader. Debian uses the Condorcet voting method for project leader elections. The
