<p>The Debian Project and the Debian Italian community are pleased to announce
that the 5th edition of the Debian Italian community conference will take place
from the 17th to the 19th of September in Perugia, Italy. For the first time,
the conference has been organized in association with the <a
href="http://www.ubuntu-it.org/">Italian Ubuntu community</a>, joining efforts
with the traditional Italian Ubuntu Meeting. For the occasion the conference
has been renamed to <a href="https://deb.li/duccit10"><q>Italian Debian/Ubuntu
Community Conference</q></a> (DUCC-IT '10 for short) and will focus on bringing
together both communities and improving cross-distribution collaboration.
Users, contributors, and enthusiasts of Debian, Ubuntu, and any other
Debian-based distribution are invited to attend. The event will also be an
opportunity to celebrate the <a href="http://softwarefreedomday.org/">annual
Software Freedom Day</a> in Italy, which will be co-located in the <a
href="http://www.fsugitalia.org/eventi/doku.php?id=sfd:sfd10">city of
Perugia</a>.</p>

<p>The conference will see the prominent participation of the current Debian
Project Leader, Stefano Zacchiroli, and some members of both <a
href="$(HOME)/women/">Debian-women</a> and <a
href="http://ubuntu-women.org/">Ubuntu-women</a> teams, explaining the benefits
of a wider collaboration scheme, and how we encourage a more heterogeneous and
balanced environment.</p>

<p>Scheduled events currently include some major technical tracks, aimed toward
new contributors, and practical sessions on Saturday, as well as social
launches, a <a href="http://www.fsugitalia.org/eventi/doku.php?id=duccit10:ksp">key-signing
party</a> and a <a href="http://www.fsugitalia.org/eventi/doku.php?id=duccit10:women">round table
discussion about female participation in the Italian free software world</a> on
the other days. More information and logistical details are available on the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianItalia/MiniDebconf2010">Debian wiki</a>, or
directly on the <a href="http://www.fsugitalia.org/eventi/doku.php?id=duccit10">conference
