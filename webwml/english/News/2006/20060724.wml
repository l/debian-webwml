<p>The Debian project confirms December 2006 as the date for the next
release of its distribution which will be named Debian GNU/Linux 4.0
alias 'etch'.  This will be the first official release to include the
AMD64 architecture.  The distribution will be released synchronously
for 11 architectures in total.</p>

<p>At this stage, the upcoming release will ship with Linux 2.6.17 as its
default kernel.  This kernel will be used across all architectures and
on the installer.  A later version may be selected during a review in
October.</p>

<p>New features of this release include the GNU Compiler Collection 4.1
as default compiler.  X.Org will replace XFree86 as implementation of
the X Window System X11.  Secure <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SecureApt">APT</a> will add extra
security by easily
supporting strong cryptography and digital signatures to validate
downloaded packages.</p>

<h2>Bug Squashing Parties</h2>

<p>A number of real-life bug squashing parties will happen before the new
distribution is released in order to squash as many of the open
release-critical bugs as possible.  They will be held in different
cities so that many people can participate in real-life.</p>

<p>Interested people who cannot join the developers in the respective
cities are invited to join the #debian-bugs channel on irc.debian.org
and participate online.</p>
