<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the fourth update of its
stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (codename `sarge').  This
update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable
release, along with a few adjustment to serious problems.  Those who
frequently update from security.debian.org won't have to update many
packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in
this update.</p>

<p>Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of
Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 but only updates some of the packages included in
the stable release.  There is no need to throw away 3.1 CDs or DVDs
but only to update against ftp.debian.org after an installation, in
order to incorporate those late changes.</p>

<p>Upgrade CD and DVD images will be created soon.  No new installation
images will be created.  Users are advised to update their system
against an official Debian mirror after a new installation and update
the kernel instead.  For the next update new images are anticipated.</p>

<p>Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
<q>apt</q> package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Bugfixes</h2>

packages:</p>

<p>This update also fixes an error in Debian-Installer for Sparc32 that
was introduced with the last stable update (r3).</p>
