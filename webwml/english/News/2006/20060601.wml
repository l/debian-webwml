<h2>Security Support for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 to be terminated on June 30th</h2>

<p>More than one year after the release of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias
'sarge' and nearly four years after the release of Debian GNU/Linux 3.0
alias 'woody' the security support for the old distribution (3.0 alias
'woody') is coming to an end next month.  The Debian project is proud to
be able to support its old distribution for such a long time and even for
one year after a new version has been released.</p>

<p>The Debian project has released Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 alias 'sarge' on the
6th of June 2005.  Users and Distributors have been given a one-year
timeframe to upgrade their old installations to the current stable
release.  Hence, the security support for the old release of 3.0 is going
to end in June 2006 as previously announced.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 alias 'woody' has been released on July 19th 2002.
Security updates for this release are going to be distributed via
security.debian.org until the end of June 2006.  Older updates will
continued to be available on security.debian.org until December 2006.
This reflects a supported lifetime of nearly four years.</p>

<h2>Security Updates</h2>

<p>The Debian Security Team provides security updates for the current
distribution via <http://security.debian.org/>.  Security updates for the
old distribution are also provided for one year after the new
distribution has been released or until the current distribution is
superseded, whatever happens first.</p>

<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system, developed by more than
thousand volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the
Internet.  Debian's dedication to Free Software, its non-profit nature,
and its open development model make it unique among GNU/Linux
distributions.</p>

<p>The Debian project's key strengths are its volunteer base, its dedication
to the Debian Social Contract, and its commitment to provide the best
operating system possible.  Debian 3.1 is another important step in that
direction.</p>
