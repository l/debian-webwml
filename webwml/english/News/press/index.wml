that it cannot be ignored by computer magazines and other press media.
Thus the project or the distribution it produces has been mentioned

#list was created.
#
# include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/News/press/$(CUR_YEAR).data"

<p>Press coverage from previous years can be viewed using the following pages:

<ul>
<:
 for ($year = $(CUR_YEAR) - 1; $year >= 2006; $year --) {
  print qq'  <li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/PressCoverage$year">Past articles from $year collected at Debian Wiki</a>\n';
 }
 for ($year = 2005; $year >= 1997; $year --) {
  print qq'  <li><a href="$year">Past articles from $year</a>\n' if -f "$(ENGLISHDIR)/News/press/$year.data";
