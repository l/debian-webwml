<define-tag pagetitle>Debian to Use Only Free Versions of the X Window System</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::news

We are dismayed by the recent decision by the <q>Open Group</q> not to
release future versions of X as free software &mdash; there will be
restrictions on commercial use, including large fees.

<p>Debian's Social Contract promises that we will only promote software
which meets our Free Software Guidelines.  These Guidelines require
availability for commercial as well as noncommercial use.</p>

<p>Debian cannot therefore ship versions of X derived from X11R6.4.
Instead we will base our releases on X11R6.3 (which is free);
we are confident that the free software community will rise to the
challenge of developing further free versions based on X11R6.3.</p>

<p>We note that XFree86 are currently considering their response to this
situation.  We sincerely hope that they will retain their alignment
with the fully-free software community by not putting further work
into the new closed X distribution from the <q>Open Group</q>.</p>

<p>We would also encourage commercial vendors (whether aligned with the
free software community or not) to express their commitment to keep X
free.</p>

<p>The duplication of effort and loss of standardization involved in
splitting the development of X is unfortunate, but has been made
inevitable by the Open Group's decision to take X away from the free
software community.</p>
