Like most heavy Internet users, Debian developers have been plagued by
e-mail "spam". Recently, spammers have been even been posting messages
to our online bug-reporting system. Sales messages have been popping up
in between the bug reports.

<p>Because of this, the Debian servers have joined MAPS, the Mail Abuse
Protection System. This is a network of system administrators that agree
to voluntarily refuse e-mail from sites that support spammers or have
poor anti-spam policies. Their web site is at
<a href="http://www.vix.com/">http://www.vix.com/</a>. MAPS
operates the Realtime Blackhole List. This is a system that allows them
to update the list of systems we refuse mail from instantly, and that
gives them the power to stop a spam in progress. Because so many systems
are participating, MAPS can get the attention of the offending sites and
can persuade them to reform their spam policies. MAPS also operates the
Transport Security Initiative, a program to educate innocent sites that
are used as relays by spammers in how to block spam.

<p>MAPS has improved the entire Internet, and it's worthy of your support.
We are working on improvements to the Debian mail programs so that Debian
users will be able join MAPS with a single command. If you want to join
now, you can do so using the instructions at the MAPS web site:
