On Sunday, August 16, 1998, Debian will turn a proud 5 years old. 
There will be an IRC party on irc.debian.org (also irc.openprojects.net) 
channel #debian on Sunday August 16 at 20:00 UTC.  Please join us for the 
festivities!

<p>From its beginnings in 1993 with about a dozen developers, Debian has 
grown into a strong organization that develops one of the world's leading 
Linux distributions.  The recently released the 2.0 'Hamm' distribution
(see <a href="$(HOME)/News/1998/19980724">http://www.debian.org/News/1998/19980724</a>)
was developed by over 400 developers 
and  contains over 1500 entirely free packages.

<p>Work on several ports is currently in progress.  PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc, 
UltraSparc, ARM, m68k, i386-hurd and more are currently under active 
development.  For more information regarding these ports, please visit our 
web page at <a href="$(HOME)/">http://www.debian.org/</a>.

<p>Plans for the future include moving towards FHS compliance, as well as 
introducing 'apt,' our next generation package manager.  Apt enables system 
administrators to keep their systems in sync with the latest available 
software using just a few simple commands to automatically retrieve the 
latest versions of packages from the Internet, and install and configure 
them.

<p>Debian is working together with Red Hat and other organizations and 
individuals from the Linux community in developing the Linux Compatibility 
Standard (LCS). To subscribe to the lcs-eng mailing list send an e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:lcs-eng-REQUEST@lists.debian.org">lcs-eng-REQUEST@lists.debian.org</a>
with the single word 'subscribe' in the subject line.

<p>Debian would like to thank all the people who have made this distribution 
grow and prosper.  These include the founder Ian Murdock, leaders Bruce 
Perens and Ian Jackson, and all of the developers that have put in countless 
hours of volunteer work.  Debian would not be possible without you. Thank 
you!

<h3>Some History</h3>
