<blockquote>
A New Stable Release of Debian<br>
by Larry Ayers

<p>In 1993 Ian Murdock created the Debian Linux distribution, initially under 
the auspices of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project. Although the 
direct connection with FSF/GNU is a thing of the past, Debian is still the 
only major distribution which is not connected with a commercial entity and 
which is maintained solely by a loosely-knit band of volunteers. The 
parallels with Linux itself make this distribution appealing to Linux users 
who value the ideals of the free-software world, including those who may 
disagree with the purist views of the FSF.
