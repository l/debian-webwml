1998 brings some changes for the Debian project. Ian Jackson is now
Debian project leader. Bruce Perens will continue as president of Software in the
Public Interest, Inc., and will work on such things as funding worthy
free software projects, external communications for the Debian project,
Open Hardware, and another SPI software project that might eventually be
as big as Debian.
