For a long time now Novare (<a href="http://www.novare.net">http://www.novare.net</a>)
has hosted the Debian
developer's central system. A few days ago, the motherboard on that system
blew out. They drove to the computer store on a Saturday, bought us a new
233MHz motherboard and new RAM, and rebuilt the system over that weekend.
Besides doing that, they built up a second system on their net for us to
use as a dedicated mailing-list server.
