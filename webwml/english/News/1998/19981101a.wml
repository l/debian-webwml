An audit of the mirrors of debian's web sites reveals a problem with some of our
second level mirror sights.  Not everyone can mirror straight from master.  It
won't support the traffic so we set up secondary sights that people could mirror
from.  Sort of like a tree.  Please be patient as we sort this out.  One attept
is to implement push mirroring but this will require the cooperation of the
mirror sight administrators.
