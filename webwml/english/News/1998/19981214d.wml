<P>An interview between Linux Today <http://linuxtoday.com> and Corel Computer 
is now available online at <http://linuxtoday.com/stories/1540.html>.  The 
interview covers distribution matters as well as as interfaces and other 
issues.  Corel's hopes for Debian's ARM Port <http://www.debian.org/ports/arm
/> are also mentioned- they hope 'advanced users' will try it and are also 
hoping for KDE support in the future.
