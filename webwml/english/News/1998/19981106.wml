<P><A HREF="http://sun.com">Sun Microsystems</A> has loaned three UltraSPARC
systems to Debian project.  They are 64-bit Ultra30 workstations, each with an
UltraSPARC-II/250MHz CPU (1M-ECache), 128MB RAM, 4.3GB Seagate SCSI drive 
and a Creator graphics card.  One system is installed at Kachina 
Technologies, Inc. and will be publicly available to Debian developers.  
The other two systems are used by developers to develop boot related 
packages and other low level tools.

<P>There is a port specific <A HREF="../../ports/sparc/">web page</A> that
contains information on the work in progress.  People interested in 
helping with the Debian UltraLinux effort should check there for the current 
port status.
