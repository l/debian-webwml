<define-tag pagetitle>Debian v2.0 ("Hamm") Beta Test</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::news

Though significantly delayed, Debian 2.0 ("Hamm") has officially been released
as "beta" for the i386 and m68k architectures.  The packages on ftp.debian.org
are up to date and ready for downloads.  Mirror sites are busy catching up on
the last few changes and should be complete by the end of the day (Thursday
morning at the absolute latest).

<p>Debian 2.0 marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.  Since
this is a significant change, we took a long time to make sure everything
was working correctly.

<p>Changes to Hamm are restricted to important bug fixes so you should encounter
relatively few changes between now and the official release.  I would
encourage those interested to go ahead with the Debian 1.3 ("Bo") to 2.0
upgrade.  This final bit of testing should help eliminate the remaining
upgrade/install problems likely to be encountered.

<p>Debian distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also available under
the "unstable" tree.  They will likely release with Debian 2.1.

<p>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp (due
to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), it is recommended that the following
upgrade procedure be followed.  This document can be found at

<p>Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version of Debian?<BR>
A: There are several methods:
   <OL>
   <li>autoup.sh - This is a script that will upgrade the programs in
      the correct order, even download the deb's for you.  Because of
      the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
      packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
      released is provided. 
      Versions are available at:<BR>
      <a href="../../releases/hamm/autoup/">the current site</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
         (ftp: also okay)
   <li>apt-get - This is the command line part of Debian's future
      package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
      download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
      able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use your
      cd, an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
      speed, variety, and recentness (if you can't tell, I like this
      one).  Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  The bo
      version is at: <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>
      and <a href="../../releases/hamm/apt-get.gz">on the current site</a>.
      The hamm version is in project/experimental.
   <li>Do it by hand.  There is a howto at:
      <a href="http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>
      but the autoup.sh simply automates this, so most users won't
      want to do this.
   </OL>
