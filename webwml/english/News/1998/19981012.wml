<P>It is now possible to boot the Corel NetWinder Computer with Debian
GNU/Linux, thanks to the work of Jim Pick and the other team members of the
Debian Arm port.  A disk image with instructions on how to use it is
available from

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/pub/debian/netwinder/bootable-image/">
ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/pub/debian/netwinder/bootable-image/</A>

A kernel package of the new ELF kernel (some notes are available at
<A HREF="http://www.netwinder.org/~ralphs/knotes.html">
http://www.netwinder.org/~ralphs/knotes.html</A>) is available from

<A HREF="ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/pub/debian/netwinder/kernel/">
ftp://ftp.jimpick.com/pub/debian/netwinder/kernel/</A>
</P>

<P>This alleviates the need for the chroot environment that previous
development work was being conducted in, and allows work to progress even
faster than before.  This will also allow more people to join in the
development effort easily.</P>
