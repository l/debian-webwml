The Debian 2.0 boot floppy package has been uploaded and is being
tested, and large-scale testing of the system is expected to begin soon.
2.0 will feature the GNU C library 2.0, also known as <q>LIBC 6</q>. Several
incremental releases are expected follow 2.0 at short intervals. The new
package manager meant to replace <q>dselect</q> is now being demonstrated, and
will probably appear in 2.1 or one of the early point releases.
<br />[dselect will still be available for those who want to use it. The new
package manager will allow package installation from X or from a text terminal. &mdash; ed.]
