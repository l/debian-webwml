#use wml::debian::news

The Debian 2.0 boot floppy package has been uploaded and is being
tested, and large-scale testing of the system is expected to begin soon.
2.0 will feature the GNU C library 2.0, also known as "LIBC 6". Several
incremental releases are expected follow 2.0 at short intervals. The new
package manager meant to replace "dselect" is now being demonstrated, and
will probably appear in 2.1 or one of the early point releases.
<BR>[dselect will still be available for those who want to use it. The new
package manager will allow package installation from X or from a text terminal. -ed.]
