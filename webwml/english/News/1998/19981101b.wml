<define-tag pagetitle>Wrong Language Bug</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::news

A bug has been found in apache and the language negotiation.  It is exacerbated
by caching in Netscape.  This bug can cause apache to serve the wrong language
page to the browsers.  If this happens, the language system can be over ridden
by specifying the desired language at the end of the url such as:

<ol>
 <li>for English, https://www.debian.org/somepage.html.en
 <li>for Japanese, https://www.debian.org/somepage.html.jp
</ol>

<p>
This "fix", however, will only work on a page by page basis and won't stick so
that the url would have to be edited each time.  In the mean time, the apache
crew is working to fix the bug.
