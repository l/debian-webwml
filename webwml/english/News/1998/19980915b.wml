<h3>What is Virtual Network Computing?</h3>

<p>Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is, in essence, a remote display system 
which allows you to view a computing <q>desktop</q> environment not only on the 
machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a 
wide variety of machine architectures. [1]  Debian packages are available 
for this program, and are included in the 2.0 <q>Hamm</q> distribution under the 
name <q>vncserver</q> with <q>xvncviewer</q> and <q>svncviewer</q> dependencies.</p>


<h3>VNC: When Dreams Become Real</h3>

<h4>Virtual Network Computing</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>When Dreams Become Real [Wenn Träume wahr werden]<br />
by Marcus Brinkmann
</p>
<p>Isn't it annoying to continually have to switch back and forth between Linux 
and Microsoft Windows?  Or to have to run back and forth between two 
computers?  Those who thought that up until now the only solution to this 
problem was an expensive X-Server for their Windows machine can now take a 
deep breath.  The recently available VNC (Virtual Network Computing) 
provides a comfortable alternative, and much more!
