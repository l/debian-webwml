You can read about the AMSAT Phase 3-D satellite at
<a href="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/phase3d.html">http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/phase3d.html</a>.
It's the most ambitious
in a long series of Ham Radio satellites (more than 30 have been
launched). Some of the software for the satellite's communications
systems and experiments was developed by Bdale Garbee N3EUA, a
long-time Debian developer, and other Radio Amateurs, using the Debian
system. Debian is a good match for AMSAT: they are both international
groups of private individuals contributing their work to highly
sophisticated technical projects
