<p>
Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' has officially been released for the i386 
and m68k architectures.
</p>

<p>It can be obtained in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>FTP:       <newsurl "http://ftp.debian.org/"></li>
<li>CD-ROM:    <newsurl "https://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/"> (list of distributors)</li>
<li>CD Images: <newsurl "https://www.debian.org/CD/"></li>
</ul>

<p>Debian 2.0 contains over 1500 precompiled binary packages contributed 
from over 400 developers, including all of the favorites: web servers, 
GIMP, gcc, egcs, XFree86, SQL servers and many other tools and utilities.
It also marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.</p>

<p>Debian's powerful package manager 'dpkg' allows for easy installation, 
maintenance and updating of packages including sophisticated handling of
dependencies and configurations.  Packages from other distributions can 
easily be installed using the 'alien' utility.</p>

<p>Debian development distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also 
available under the 'unstable' tree from the FTP site.  They will likely
be released with Debian 2.1 'Slink'.  Development is currently in 
progress for UltraSparc, Netwinder and Hurd based distributions.</p>

<h3>Upgrade Information</h3>

<p>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a specific upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describing this procedure can be found at:</p>
<p class="centerblock">
   <newsurl "https://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/HOWTO.upgrade">
</p>

<p>
There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>autoup.sh<br />
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is in the developers corner
     of the Debian web site, but newer versions are at:
     <ul>
        <li><newsurldead "https://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/autoup/"></li>
        <li><newsurldead "http://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/"></li>
        <li><newsurldead "http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/"></li>
        <li><newsurldead "http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/"></li>
        <li><newsurldead "http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/"></li>
     </ul></li>
  <li>apt-get<br />
       This is the command line part of Debian's future
     package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
     download them from a local archive, http, and FTP sites.  It is
     able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use a CD,
     an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
     speed, variety, and latest versions.  
     Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  
     The 'Bo' version is at: <newsurldead "http://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/">.
     The 'Hamm' version is in project/experimental.</li>
  <li>By hand<br />
       A HOWTO can be found at
     <newsurldead "https://www.debian.org/releases/hamm/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">
     but as the autoup.sh simply automates this process this is the
     least convenient option.</li>
</ol>
