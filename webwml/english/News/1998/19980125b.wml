Debian's "master" system is a Pentium 90 with 64MB graciously provided
by one of our donors, Novare, who also donate its site in Texas, its support,
and its internet connection. It delivers over 100,000 e-mails daily,
runs the CVS server for the GNOME project, is our master FTP server
with many mirror systems accessing it every day, hosts our bug reporting
system and many project utilities, and is the "home" system of our 200
developers, who compile, upload, and download using that system every day.
This is a heavier load than people put on a single commercial workstation
running anything but Linux. A Microsoft NT system with a Pentium Pro and
128MB RAM would not approach the load this system handles effortlessly every
day. The system just ran continuously for three months without a reboot.

<p>The following quote is from Bruce Perens (past president of Debian and
board member of SPI) who works at Pixar:</p>
<blockquote><p>I thought three months without a reboot was a big deal. When I mentioned
it to our developers, one of them showed me details about his system. It
was up for 458 days, and was halted to move it to another floor. The network
and disk device drivers had handled tens of millions of interrupts in that
time.</p></blockquote>
