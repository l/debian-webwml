Well, maybe not quite live... but we are included in the picture with 
Chris Nuttall's article 'Newsgathering on the Net' which can be found at

<h3>Newsgathering on the Net.</h3>
By Internet Correspondent Chris Nuttall 
 
<p>As a foreign correspondent, I was always inspired by the quote that people 
like us were "writing the first draft of history." Now I am an Internet 
correspondent, I have been deservedly humbled by the realisation that even 
the most crafted online pieces really only amount to the first draft of a 
story.

<p>Several examples in the past week show that while the Internet can be the 
source of unfounded rumours and ill-researched stories, it can also repair 
any such damage, in the end creating something more solid and substantial 
than is possible in any other medium.
