Databases with Linux [Datenbanken mit Linux]<br>
Adabas - mSQL - Postgres - Yard-SQL<br>
Dr. Bernhard Roehrig

<p>The start of the journey into the Information Age has begun.  Those who do 
not merely want to be there but also want to help define trends must be 
faster than the others.  Above all, they must be in a position to provide 
information more quickly.  This information must be current, well 
structured, and provided in an appropriate format to the consumer.

<p>The book deals with these issues and shows how to use the Freeware operating 
system Linux and several Database management systems to provide extremely 
price effective solutions for local networks and the Internet.
