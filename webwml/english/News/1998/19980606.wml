Kachina Technologies, Inc. (<a href="http://kachinatech.com">http://kachinatech.com</a>)
has decided to help 
make the Debian Sparc distribution commercially available to Linux 
community.  When ready, the Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 <q>Hamm</q> Sparc distribution 
will be offered by Kachina on both CD-ROM and on preinstalled systems as 
well.

<p>When asked about their work with Linux, Ward Deng of Kachina stated:</p>

<p><q>[Kachina] has been working on UltraSPARC systems and Linux for many years 
and realized UltraSPARC and Linux is the best combination for 
high-performance computing users. We have demonstrated an UltraLinux cluster 
at a trade show and drew a lot of attention.</q></p>

<p><q>We have been working on a native port of high-performance development 
environment including Fujitsu Fortran 90, C, and other compiler/tools on the 
Linux/UltraSPARC platform.</q></p>

<p><q>We have been supporting UltraLinux port by providing loan systems to key 
Sparc/Linux developers and we will continue doing so. Not only we will 
provide remote access and network resource to Debian/UltraLinux developers, 
we also intend to provide developers or early users preloaded systems at 
prices below their costs to show our support and appreciation.</q></p>

<p>When asked why Debian was the distribution of choice, the reply was:</p>

<p><q>Debian is obviously the best distribution so far. The Debian packaging 
system and its organized volunteer-based development made it more 
maintainable and guaranteed its openness in a long run.</q></p>

<p>Kachina is providing Internet access, disk space, a publicly accessible 
test system, as well as manpower on software packaging and testing to help 
the Debian Sparc effort.</p>

<p>Kachina also hosts Scientific Applications on Linux (SAL) 
(http://sal.kachinatech.com), which is a collection of information and links 
to software that is useful to scientists and engineers.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux has been working on a Sparc distribution since November 
1996.  This distribution is expected to be ready for release within the next 
few months.</p>
