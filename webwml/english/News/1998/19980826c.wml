<h3>Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 Beta</h3>

<p>One of the problems with early Linux distributions such as SLS and
Slackware was the workload they imposed upon those maintaining
them. The kernel itself was still undergoing rapid change, and
high-level components were growing both in number and complexity.</p>

<p>The Debian Linux distribution was conceived to address this problem, by 
using a volunteer development model similar to that used by Torvalds in the 
creation of the kernel itself. This has spread the workload more evenly 
throughout the Linux community. It has also provided Linux enthusiasts with 
the opportunity to participate closely in the development of the 
distribution.</p>

<p>...<br/>

While not receiving the same level of attention from the mainstream media as 
some commercial distributions, Debian Linux is a solid, comprehensive 
product, and a genuine pleasure to use. It is also great to become involved 
with the Debian collective, whose friendliness and spirit recalls the early 
days of the Internet and its sense of openness and global cooperation.</p>
