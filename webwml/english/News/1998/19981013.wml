<P>The letter received from APC Magazine states:</P>
<PRE>
  Congratulations on receiving the APC Highly Commended award for Debian
  GNU/Linux 2.0 in our review of Linux Distributions in the September 1998
  edition.

  We make these awards after extensive testing and review, and the small
  number of products that receive them are recognised by our readers as being
  the market leaders and best products and technologies in their class.
