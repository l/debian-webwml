<P>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 'Slink' is now in a frozen state. 
The delay was due to the need to stabilize some key packages in the
distribution.  The release of Slink is scheduled for December 1998.

<P>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 'Potato' will be the next version of the Debian 
distribution.  The name is taken from the character 'Mr. Potato Head' in the 
animated movie 'Toy Story.'
