<P>The Spanish magazine "Linux Actual" is currently the only magazine for 
Spanish speakers dedicated to Linux.  In its September issue it features 
three articles on Debian GNU/Linux entitled "An Introduction to Debian," 
"The Debian package system," and "Installation of Debian 2.0."  It also 
includes two CDs with the official Debian GNU/Linux 2.0r1b1 binary and 
source distributions.

<P>This is a chance for Spanish Linux users to try Debian 2.0 since Spanish 
CD vendors currently only ship Debian 1.3.1 CDs.

<P>"Linux Actual" is also shipped overseas to South America countries.
Previous issues of the magazine are available from:
