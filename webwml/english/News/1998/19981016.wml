<p>The Spanish magazine <q>Linux Actual</q> is currently the only magazine for 
Spanish speakers dedicated to Linux.  In its September issue it features 
three articles on Debian GNU/Linux entitled <q>An Introduction to Debian,</q> 
<q>The Debian package system,</q> and <q>Installation of Debian 2.0.</q>  It also 
includes two CDs with the official Debian GNU/Linux 2.0r1b1 binary and 
source distributions.</p>

<p>This is a chance for Spanish Linux users to try Debian 2.0 since Spanish 
CD vendors currently only ship Debian 1.3.1 CDs.</p>

<p><q>Linux Actual</q> is also shipped overseas to South America countries.
