"Linux Actual" includes Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' CDs

"Linux Actual" includes Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' CDs

  The Spanish magazine "Linux Actual" is currently the only magazine for 
Spanish speakers dedicated to Linux.  In its September issue it features 
three articles on Debian GNU/Linux entitled "An Introduction to Debian," 
"The Debian package system," and "Installation of Debian 2.0."  It also 
includes two CDs with the official Debian GNU/Linux 2.0r1b1 binary and 
source distributions.

  This is a chance for Spanish Linux users to try Debian 2.0 since Spanish 
CD vendors currently only ship Debian 1.3.1 CDs.

  "Linux Actual" is also shipped overseas to South America countries.
Previous issues of the magazine are available from:
