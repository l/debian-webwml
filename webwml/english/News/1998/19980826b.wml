The Debian GNU/Linux ARM distribution is a port of Debian to the ARM 
architecture and will run on Corel's NetWinder.  Development will eventually 
target other ARM processors as well.  The ARM port will likely be included 
in the next distribution of Debian.

<p>Corel Computer Corp.'s NetWinder network computers are based on the 
powerful, scalable, open source Linux OS.  They deliver the computing power,
speed, and reliability needed for both end-user and server applications.
 
<p>"Corel Computer is very impressed with the quality and speed of the Debian
development efforts," said Chris Herrnberger, NetWinder product development
manager. "The work is greatly appreciated and sets a high standard for other
NetWinder developers to follow."

<p>Information on the current status of the distribution can be found at

Information on other distributions is also available at

<p>We would like to thank Corel for providing developers with a machine to work 
on, and for their technical support.  Thanks also to the Ottawa-Carleton
Linux Users Group (OCLUG) for hosting the machines.
