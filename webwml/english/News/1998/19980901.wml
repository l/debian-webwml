#use wml::debian::news

A new mailing list debian-news has been created for dissemination of news 
about the project that is does not need to be distributed as widely as posts 
to debian-announce are.  debian-news list will carry announcements that 
include news articles about Debian, books that are about Debian or include 
the distribution, and other miscellaneous Debian related news items that 
people may find interesting.

<p>News items from both debian-announce and debian-news will appear in the News 
section of the Debian web page.

<p>The first few news items will be cross posted to both lists to allow people 
to subscribe to the new list should they choose to do so.
