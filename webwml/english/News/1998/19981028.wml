	A Public Letter to the Debian Group from Corel Computer


	October 26, 1998


	Dear Mr. Jim Pick:

	I am writing you to express my congratulations and highest regards for
	the Debian Group's port of Debian GNU/Linux to the NetWinder(TM) and
	StrongARM(TM) microprocessor. I understand Debian GNU/Linux, the award
	winning distribution of the Linux operating system, is available in a
	pre-release form and will boot and run the various NetWinder Linux-based
	computers. I like many, eagerly await the release of Slink, the next
	Debian GNU/Linux release, and hope that the StrongARM port takes its
	place alongside the many platforms supported by the Debian Group. I
	salute the group of about 40 highly talented developers who have
	collaborated on this Open Source project; the results have been nothing
	less than spectacular. It is further affirmation that Open Source
	software leads to innovative consequences.

	The NetWinder DM was released at the end of June and in a few months
	this tiger-team of Debian developers have ported hundreds of new
	programs to this platform. I am told that within a week of the release,
	a development group had been formed and porting had begun. It surely is
	a testament to your ingenuity as many of the developers had not yet
	received their own NetWinder. I think this is a great example of
	"community development" as the group was able to collaborate on code
	through the sharing of NetWinder systems via the Internet.

	Flashing ahead to October, and thanks to the work of yourself and the
	other team members, a new choice is now available for the NetWinder and
	future StrongARM-based projects. The highly reliable and professional
	groundwork put in place by your team allows others to join the effort
	and move forward even faster than before. There is much that other Open
	Source developers as well as developers of commercial software may be
	learn from this project. I would like to personally thank all those who
	have participated, most of whom, I am told, are registered on this web
	site: http://www.debian.org/ports/arm/

	Although I could not personally attend the Atlanta Linux Showcase this
	last weekend, I extend best wishes for the ongoing success of a
	NetWinder running Debian GNU/Linux.

	Sincerely,


	Ron McNab, VP and General Manager
