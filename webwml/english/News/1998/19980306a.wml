Debian's goal is to be fair to all businesses. Part of that is not
giving one business an advantage over another.

<p>We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the "Debian" trademark.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian GNU/Linux distribution,
you can call that product "Debian". If you want to use the name in some
other way, you should ask us _first_.

<p>To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no business use the name
"Debian" in the name of the business, or a domain name of the business.

<p>A few times well-meaning people have called us just a bit too late to
keep them from losing a few hundred dollars and some time and being
disappointed. In all cases these people have meant well, and have
approached us with gifts in hand, and it is a shame to disappoint them.
Hopefully, this warning will protect the next person.
