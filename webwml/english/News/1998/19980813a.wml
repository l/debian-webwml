<blockquote>
 The Next Millennium Headache<br>
 by Michael Stutz <br>

<P>12.Aug.98.PDT<br>
Sometime in the future, the day and date settings deep inside millions of 
computers will roll over to a value that the machines don't understand. The 
likely upshot: system crashes in critical systems such as air traffic 
control and banking.

<P>But don't panic -- we still have almost 40 years to deal with it.
