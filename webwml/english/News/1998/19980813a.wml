 The Next Millennium Headache<br />
 by Michael Stutz </p>

<p>12.Aug.98.PDT<br />

computers will roll over to a value that the machines don't understand. The 
likely upshot: system crashes in critical systems such as air traffic 
control and banking.

<p>But don't panic &mdash; we still have almost 40 years to deal with it.
