<p>
Debian Edu is a complete operating system for schools.
Through its various installation profiles you can install servers,
workstations and laptops which will work together on the school network.
With Debian Edu, the teachers themselves or their technical support can
roll out a complete multi-user multi-machine study
environment within hours or a few days. Debian Edu comes with hundreds of
applications pre-installed, but you can always add more packages from Debian.
</p>
<p>
The Debian Edu developer team is happy to announce Debian Edu 7.1+edu0
<q>Wheezy</q>, the sixth Debian Edu / Skolelinux release, based on
Debian 7 (aka <q>Wheezy</q>), which has been updated and carefully improved
compared to the previous Squeeze release while keeping its unique feature
set and ease of maintainability.

Some recent feedback:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Giorgio Pioda, system administrator, who is using Debian Edu at SPSE
(<a href="http://www.spse.ch/">Scuola per Sportivi d’Élite</a>) in
Tenero, Switzerland (Cantone Ticino, Italian speaking part), says:
<q>I can report that I'm on production with Debian Edu Wheezy since
mid-August and it works rock solid, we are using it every day.</q>
</li>
<li>
Nigel Barker, IT Coordinator at
<a href="http://www.hiroshima-is.ac.jp/">Hiroshima
International School</a>, Japan:
<q>I was able to get a new Tjener and computer room ready for
the new school year in only 4 days following the beta 1 release.
I have been very happy with the way things have been running during the
first month of school.</q>
</li>
<li>
Lucas Nussbaum, <a href="$(HOME)">Debian</a> Project Leader:
<q>Debian Edu is a fantastic project, for at least two reasons.
First, because it exposes a wider public, and specifically
children, to Free Software and Debian.
Second, because it demonstrates how one can build a successful
distribution on top of Debian, while doing all the work inside Debian.</q>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>About Debian Edu and Skolelinux</h2>
<p>
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Debian Edu, also known as
Skolelinux</a>, is a Linux distribution based on Debian providing an
out-of-the box environment of a completely configured school network.
Immediately after installation a school server running all services
needed for a school network is set up just waiting for users and
machines to be added via GOsa², a comfortable Web-UI.
A netbooting environment is prepared using PXE, so after initial
installation of the main server from CD or USB stick all other
machines can be installed via the network.
The provided school server provides an LDAP database and Kerberos
authentication service, centralized home directories, a DHCP server, a web
proxy and many other services.  The desktop contains
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Educational_applications_included_in_Debian_Edu___Skolelinux__the_screenshot_collection____.html">more
than 60 educational software packages</a> and more besides are available from
the Debian archive, and schools can choose between KDE Plasma, GNOME, LXDE and
Xfce desktop environments.
