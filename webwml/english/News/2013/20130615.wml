<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the first update of its
stable distribution Debian <release> (codename <q><codename></q>). 
This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable
release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems.  Security advisories
were already published separately and are referenced where available.</p>

<p>Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
<release> but only updates some of the packages included.  There is
no need to throw away <release> CDs or DVDs but only to update via an
up-to-date Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date
packages to be updated.</p>

<p>Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.</p>

<p>New installation media and CD and DVD images containing updated packages
will be available soon at the regular locations.</p>

<p>Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:</p>
