<p>
The Debian Project has lost a member of its community. Ray Dassen (jdassen) died on May 
18th.
</p>

<p>
Ray was a Debian Developer for an incredible 19 years.
He joined the project in 1994, and continued to be an active
contributor until recently.
<br />
Ray was one of the founding members of the Debian GNOME team,
his friendliness and willingness to help fostered a spirit
of collaboration within the GNOME team.
He continued his involvement within Debian as the maintainer
of several packages, most notably the Gnumeric spreadsheet.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Project honours Ray's great work and his strong dedication
to Debian and Free Software.  
His technical knowledge and his ability to share that knowledge
with others will be missed. His contributions will not be 
forgotten, and the high standards of his work will continue 
to serve as an inspiration to others.
