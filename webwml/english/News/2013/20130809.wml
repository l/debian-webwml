<h2>About Debian</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.debian.org/">The Debian Project</a> was founded in 1993 by
Ian Murdock to be a truly free community project aiming to build a free
operating system. Since then the project has grown to be one of the largest and
most influential open source projects. Available in 70 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the universal
operating system; the current release includes over 20,000 software packages
for more than ten computer architectures, ranging from the common desktops and
laptops to mobile phones and tablets up to big computing mainframes. Debian is
the basis for several other Linux distributions, including Knoppix and Ubuntu.
Thousands of volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain the Debian system, many of them in their spare time.
</p><p>
The Debian Project’s key strengths are its volunteer base and commitment to
providing the best operating system possible. Apart from DebConf most
communication takes place on the Internet in mailing-lists and chat-rooms.
Unlike all other Linux distributions of similar size Debian is an independent
non-profit organization not backed by a commercial company. Debian’s dedication
to Free Software, its non-profit nature, and its open development model make it
unique among Free Software distributions.
