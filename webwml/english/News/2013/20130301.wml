<p> 
The Debian Project is pleased to announce that, according to the terms of
the <a href="$(HOME)/trademark#policy">new trademark policy</a>, Debian
logos and marks may now be used <a href="$(HOME)/intro/free">freely</a>
for both non-commercial and commercial purposes. The Debian Project
encourages wide use of its marks in all ways that promote 
Debian and free software.
</p>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli, current Debian Project Leader and one of the main
promoters of the new trademark policy, said <q>Software freedoms and
trademarks are a difficult match. We all want to see well-known project
names used to promote free software, but we cannot risk they will be
abused to trick users into downloading proprietary spyware. With the help
of <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">SPI</a> and <a
href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">SFLC</a>, we have
struck a good balance in our new trademark policy. Among other
positive things, it allows all sorts of commercial use; we only
recommend clearly informing customers about how much of the sale price
will be donated to Debian.</q>
</p>

<p> 
As the arrival of the new stable release, Debian 7.0 <q>Wheezy</q>, approaches,
vendors are encouraged to create Wheezy-themed merchandise (t-shirts,
stickers, mugs, etc.), using the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/Joy">upcoming 
release's artwork</a>.
</p>


<p>
We further invite you to check out the current list of
<a href="$(HOME)/misc/merchandise">Debian
merchandise vendors</a>, and see the information at the bottom of the
page if you would like to be added to it.
