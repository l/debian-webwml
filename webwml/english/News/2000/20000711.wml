<p>The Zeroth Debian Conference which was organized and sponsored by the
<a href="http://www.abul.org/">Bourdeaux Linux User Group</a> (ABUL, in
French), took place last week from July 5-9 2000 in Bourdeaux, France, in
parallel with the <a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting</a>.

<p>During the conference many
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic18_en.html">topics</a> were
presented, including:

<ul>
  <li>two introductory talks about the GNU/Hurd given by
      <a href="http://www.walfield.org/">Neal Walfield</a> and
      <a href="http://www.stallman.org/">Richard M. Stallman</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/talks/">an overview of
      Debian past and present</a>
  <li>a brief discussion about the new package format given by Wichert
      Akkerman
  <li><a href="http://www.pingoo.org/">PingOO</a>, a project to provide
      schools with communication servers administered remotely by a
      distributed team, based on Debian GNU/Linux
  <li>Package Pools overview presented by Anthony Towns
  <li><a href="http://www.openrock.net/">Telemetry Software</a> (remote
      management and diagnostics of networks and servers) provided by
      <a href="http://www.siterock.com/">SiteRock</a> also based on
      Debian GNU/Linux
  <li>presentations and discussion about new maintainers and Debian
      organization
</ul>

<p>Two presentations about Debian's Internal Organization (presented by Nils
Lohner) and the New Maintainer process (presented by Dale Scheetz) were
presented together in one session.  A lot of discussion was encouraged in
this session to get feedback from both Debian developers and users to see
how these issues are regarded and how to improve the problems that are being
faced in these areas.

<p>Dale pointed out that if Debian keeps growing at the same rate as during
the past five years there could be 1600 developers maintaining 40000
packages by the year 2005.  This makes clear that Debian needs to present a
clear organizational structure to developers, would-be developers and users
to allow people to become familiar with Debian more quickly and allow them
to help if they so desire.

<p>Nils suggested putting up Project Pages to present tasks that need doing
in Debian both for developers and non developers.  Several people at the
conference manifested interest in the idea and discussion will be taking
place on the debian-qa mailing list.  The idea is to keep track of on-going
projects within Debian in terms of their existence and their current status,
as well as listing tasks that can be picked up by people.

<p>To enable people to better understand Debian's organization Nils also
suggested that people in Debian explain (one or two paragraphs would
suffice) what they are doing, so this information can be collected and
placed on the <a href="$(HOME)/intro/organization">website</a>.
This would allow people who have concerns or suggestions to immediately find
the correct person in Debian to talk to.

<p>He also pointed that long term goals of Debian need to be both as a
project and as a distribution to ensure that Debian continues to be a good
distribution and continues its leadership in the free software community.

<p>Another point discussed was the need for getting people into Debian for
tasks other than maintaining packages such as writing documentation and
doing administrative work.  One of the questions left open was how to
attract people to do that.  A possible solution to this would be to add
these tasks to the proposed Project Pages.  It was mentioned that the name
"Debian developer" and the fact that Debian appears to be a "show me the
code" organization scares these potential helpers away.

<p>The suggestion was made to package things such as documentation and
website source to enable more people to submit patches against it.  This
would lower the amount of work put on the shoulders of the webmasters and
people in charge of the different sections.

<p>Another solution proposed was to find sponsors to pay people to work on
Debian related tasks.  This could help the project, but first the work to be
done must be clearly identified.  The Project Pages again could help in this
regard.

<p>At the end of this session everyone agreed that many of the resource
problems stem from not passing information around and/or not having this
information readily available to people both inside and outside of the
project.  Debian needs to increase the level of its internal organization to
allow non developers to be able to comment and contribute more easily and to
enable new maintainers to more quickly understand the current organization.

<p>All in all the meetings were very interesting for everyone attending the
conference.  Many of the developers had a chance to meet face to face for
the first time and exchange ideas regarding many aspects of the project.

<p>This conference will likely be held again next year.  Bordeaux will
be the site to host it again as there was an excellent infrastructure
(accommodations, meals, conference rooms, net access, etc.) and this year's
conference was a success even though the organization was done in three
months.  With more time to organize next year's conference more developers
should be able to attend and a more diverse program of presentations and
round table discussions should be possible.

<p>Debian would like to thank Thierry Laronde &lt;thierry.laronde@polynum.com&gt;
for organizing this event.  Great work!
