<p>The Compaq Testdrive program has recently added Debian's frozen GNU/Linux
distribution, potato (aka, Debian 2.2) to the list of systems available
for use.

<p>Compaq is now making testdrives available via the Internet for the Open
Source community. This is a program that lets users world-wide get a
shell account, free of charge, for development and testing purposes.

<p>By registering for a shell account at
<a href="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/">http://www.testdrive.compaq.com/</a>
developers can evaluate the Debian distributions running on Compaq
AlphaServers and ProLiant Servers.  Current Debian systems are:
AlphaServer DS20 (ev6), AlphaServer XP1000a(ev6.7), and ProLiant
5500 (x86 PIII). All systems have at least two (2) gigs of ram and as
much as 100 gigs of "/home" storage courtesy of a network file system.

<p>The AlphaServers have the latest Compaq optimized FORTRAN compilers as
well as the GNU tools installed.

<p>These machines provide an excellent means  for interested parties to
try out the Debian distribution. In addition, they provide valuable
uptime and stability statistics on newer hardware that can be used to
isolate and correct potential problems on new architectures. These
machines should not be used for benchmarking purposes as at any given
time there are numerous users working on them.

<p>Debian wishes to thank all of the contributors of the system, especially
Michael Waite (Compaq), and David Huggins-Daines, Christian Meder,
and Christopher C. Chimelis  (all of Debian) for their hard work in
configuring and administering these resources.
