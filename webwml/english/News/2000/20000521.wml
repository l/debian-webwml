<P>The Debian Project has upgraded its main FTP server, ftp.debian.org.
Thanks to Atipa Linux Solutions who donated new hardware and services
to upgrade the existing machine.  The upgrade consists of two new 9G
hard drives to complement the existing three drives in the RAID5
system as well as 512Meg of ECC RAM.  This upgraded machine will allow
Debian to continue to provide its full archive to the public and
service the increased demand.

<P>At the same step the machine was moved to a new location, provided by
Gigabell AG.  The machine is now colocated on a 100Mbit port at their
New York facility and is connected directly to their high-speed
international backbone.  "We are happy to provide the service," states
Jan Czmok, Senior Network Engineer at Gigabell, "and to help the open
source community grow."

<P>While ftp.debian.org was being upgraded, FTP service was provided by
SourceForge hosted at VA Linux Systems.  SourceForge mirrors all of
Debian and many other distributions as a service to the community.

<P>Debian wishes to thank all of the contributors of the system and
hosting site as well as the developers who invested time and effort
into testing and configuring the system for Debian's network.  The
Debian project especially thanks MindSpring Enterprises, Inc., an
Atlanta based Internet Service Provider, for hosting the FTP server
before.
