<p>"The code freeze for the next Debian release, code named "potato", has
begun", says Richard Braakman, current Debian Release Manager.  He
expects the freeze process to take about two months.

<p>Until the new version is released, there will be three distributions
available on our servers: `stable', `frozen', and the new `unstable'.

<p>"The new `unstable' distribution, code named »woody«[1], was created
today", continues Richard.  The `frozen' and `unstable' distributions
start out with the same set of packages.  While `unstable' will be
updated rapidly, `frozen' will have only bugfixes applied in
preparation for its release.

<p>[1] Debian releases are code-named after characters from the movie Toy
Story.  Woody is the main character, the cowboy action figure.
