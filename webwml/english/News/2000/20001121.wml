<p>The Debian Project has been invited to join the Advisory Board of the
recently created Gnome Foundation.  The Advisory Board is a forum for
organizations and companies that have an interest in Gnome to
communicate with the Board of the Foundation and work together to
support Gnome.

Advisory Board like Borland, Compaq, Eazel, Free Software Foundation,
Gnumatic, Helix Code, Henzai, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, MandrakeSoft,
Object Management Group, Red Hat, Sun Microsystems, TurboLinux and VA
Linux.

<p>The Gnome Foundation will work to further the goals of the Gnome
project.  To achieve these goals, the Foundation will coordinate

The Foundation will act as an official voice for the Gnome project,
providing a means of communication with the press and with commercial
and noncommercial organizations interested in Gnome software.
