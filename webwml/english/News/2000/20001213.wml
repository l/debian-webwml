<p>The Debian project will run a booth at this year's LinuxFEST in
Belgrad, Yugoslavia. LinuxFEST 2000 takes place from December 15th to
December 18th at the main hall in Dom Omladine in Belgrad, Yugoslavia.

<p>The main aim of the event is to educate people and promote Linux in
a country that has been left far behind the technological
advancements because of the political situation for the past decade.
<a href="http://www.linuxfest.org.yu/index_e.html">LinuxFEST</a> is
organised by a group of Linux enthusiasts who believe that Linux should come
to Yugoslavia on a large scale and not be employed only in research
organisations, universities and among a few 'geeks'.  The event will
comprise a full research conference, promotional talks, exhibitions and
install fest.

for more information.
