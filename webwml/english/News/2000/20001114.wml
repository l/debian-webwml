<p>A new update of the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 release (aka 'potato') has been
released. The new release, version 2.2r1, includes both security updates
and fixes to important bugs in the stable distribution tree.

<p>The Debian team is currently working on several security issues and other
bug fixes are pending.  A 2.2r2 release is expected within the next 10 days
to address these issues.  It is recommended that people wishing to install
these updates or create CD images wait until the release of version 2.2r2
to do so.

<p>Several patches to ensure better synchronization of binaries between
different architectures have also been included.  Some new packages
(notably console-apt and Mozilla M18) have been installed in the
distribution.

<p>A complete list of the packages that have changed with this release can be
