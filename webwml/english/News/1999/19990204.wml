#use wml::debian::news

<p>The Debian project is in the process of looking for a new logo.  Currently 
Debian has a semi-official logo, which can be seen at
#&lt;<A HREF="$(HOME)/logos/debianlogo-2.jpg">http://www.debian.org/logos/debianlogo-2.jpg</A>&gt;.
&lt;<A HREF="$(HOME)/logos/oldlogo.gif">http://www.debian.org/logos/oldlogo.gif</A>&gt;.
As a majority of Debian 
developers are not happy with the current logo, we are searching for a new 
logo to replace the current one using a GIMP logo contest.  Submission 
information and other details are available at
&lt;<A HREF="http://contest.gimp.org/">http://contest.gimp.org/</A>&gt;.

<p>Debian would like to have two logos: one logo with a very liberal license 
that everyone is free to use (for example on webpages, shirts, etc.), and 
a more official logo with a restricted license which can only be used on 
official Debian items (like CD's produced from the official ISO-images).  
Please note both license are not finished yet.

<p>Of course it is important to determine what exactly constitutes a logo.  
The logo should meet the following criteria:

<ul>
<li>it must be easily recognizable as the Debian logo
<li>it should not be Linux specific
<li>it must look good in black &amp; white
<li>it must be scalable
<li>it should not be too detailed, so it works in low resolution
<li>works both with and without text at the bottom (can be ignored if the 
  text `Debian' is part of the logo)
</ul>

<p>Each submission should consist of 2 logos for the reasons explained above. 
Details on submissions can be found on the GIMP contest homepage at 
&lt;<A HREF="http://contest.gimp.org/">http://contest.gimp.org/</A>&gt;.

<p>The winning logo will be decided on by the Debian developers. Since there 
are a lot of active developers it may take as long as 3-4 weeks after the 
end of the contest to decide who the winner is.

<p>The winner will be awarded an email-address at debian.org, a CD-set
with Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 for the architecture of his/her choice (Alpha,
i386, m68k, or Sparc) and ever-lasting fame for creating the Debian 
logo-set.
