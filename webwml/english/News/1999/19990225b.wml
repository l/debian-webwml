#use wml::debian::news

<P>A new set of web pages have been added to the Debian web site.  These web
pages are the events pages, available at 
<A HREF="$(HOME)/events/">https://www.debian.org/events/</A>,
and contain Linux related events that are happening around the world.
These pages list the events and also contain information about whether or
not Debian is planning to attend the events, and if so, what is being
planned for the events.

<P>The contact address for adding events, or if you are interested in helping
Debian at an event, is <A HREF="mailto:events@debian.org">events@debian.org</A>.
