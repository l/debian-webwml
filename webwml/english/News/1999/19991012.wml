<h3>Popular Non-Commercial Linux Distribution Bundled as CD-ROM & Book Package</h3>

<p>Atlanta, GA - October 12, 1999 - VA Linux Systems, O'Reilly Associates and
SGI, Inc. (NYSE:SGI) announced today that the three companies have come
together to support the Debian Project by sponsoring the introduction of the
Debian GNU/Linux operating system to major retail stores.  Profits from
Debian GNU/Linux sales will be donated to Software in the Public Interest, a
non-profit organization for Open Source projects including Debian.

<p>Debian is currently the most popular "non-commercial" version of the
Linux(R) operating system, and was voted a LinuxWorld Conference & Expo Show
Favorite.  Key to Debian's success is its ongoing development by over 500
volunteer developers worldwide who maintain more than 2500 free software
packages.

<p>Until now Debian GNU/Linux has been available largely via download from the
Internet.  The joint effort by VA Linux Systems, O'Reilly and SGI thus marks
the first time that Debian GNU/Linux will be packaged and made available
with commercial documentation and add-ons as a major retail product.

<p>"The combined sponsorship of VA, O'Reilly and SGI is a unique effort
allowing everyone to try the non-commercial Debian distribution," said
Wichert Akkerman, the current Debian project leader.  "The distribution has
been built with the loving care of over 500 Debian developers, and we hope
it will give everyone the same pleasant experience it gives us."

<p>The Debian GNU/Linux package will be offered for a suggested introductory
price of $19.95, and will consist of a CD of 1440 open source software
packages, along with Bill McCarty's "Learning Debian GNU/Linux," published
by O'Reilly.  In addition, the package will include a demo CD version of
Loki Entertainment's "Myth II: Soulblighter" game software.  In keeping with
the spirit of Debian, O'Reilly will be making the book freely available
online under the Open Publication License.

<p>The Debian Project's Internet-based development model has helped the
distribution achieve unparalleled Internet functionality.  One of the most
popular features in Debian GNU/Linux is "apt-get," which automates free
network downloads of all software package updates, making the Debian CD the
last CD a user would ever need to keep system up-to-date with Linux.

<p>The Debian package sponsored by VA, O'Reilly and SGI will be available
direct from valinux.com, and through major retail and online stores.
Debian.org offers support for the distribution through email, web and IRC.
In addition, VA Linux Systems is sponsoring a commercial support package for
new Debian GNU/Linux users.

<p>"Debian is currently the second most requested Linux distribution among VA
Linux Systems customers," said Brian Biles, VA Linux Systems' vice president
of marketing.  "We applaud the Debian Project for its long, outstanding
contribution to the Free Software and Open Source communities."

<p>"Debian embodies many of the best practices of open source
development.Debian's developer community is already the largest in the Linux
world;  all that it has needed to make it more accessible to new users is
better documentation, packaging, and distribution," said Tim O'Reilly, CEO
of O'Reilly & Associates.  "This distribution will jump Debian into the
first rank not just for hard core Linux developers but for everyone."

<p>"The Open Source development model has resulted in several key
accomplishments including the creation of Debian GNU/Linux," said Dave
McAllister, director of strategic technology for SGI. "Together with
O'Reilly and VA Linux Systems, SGI has ensured greater accessibility to
quality Linux solutions."
