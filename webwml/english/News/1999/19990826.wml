<P>Debian has, as the result of a GIMP Logo contest,
 <a href="http://contest.gimp.org/">http://contest.gimp.org/</a>,
chosen a new logo.  The logo was selected by a vote of the Debian developers 
(see <a href="$(HOME)/vote/">http://www.debian.org/vote/</a>
for more information), and the winning 
entry was submitted by Raul M. Silva of onShore, Inc. and can be seen on the 
main Debian web pages.

<P>Licenses and conditions for use can be found at
<a href="$(HOME)/logos/">http://www.debian.org/logos/</a>.

<P>Regarding the selection of his logo (affectionately known as 'the swirl') by 
the Debian project, Raul said, "I'm very pleased that we're able to give 
something back to the Debian community.  We've been very happy with Debian 
GNU/Linux, and have been working with it internally and for our clients for 
a number of years now."

<P>As the winner of the contest, Raul receives a debian.org email address as 
well as a CD of the latest Debian distribution for the architecture of his 
choice.  Debian wishes to thank all of the participants in the contest.
