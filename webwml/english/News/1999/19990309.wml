<p> Exactly on the revised schedule, at 00:00 GMT, March 9, Debian 2.1 
(codenamed slink) was released.  Release information is available
<a href="/releases/slink/">here</a>.

<p> The bugs which delayed Debian for one week have been satisfactorily
resolved.  

<p> CD Images have gone final, and should be making their way to
distributors shortly - we have a list of debian vendors
<a href="$(HOME)/CD/vendors/">here</a>.  Up-to-date raw images will be
available in a few days from
<a href="ftp://sunsite.org.uk/packages/debian-cd/">the SunSITE UK FTP
site</a>, which is also rsync accessible at
sunsite.org.uk::public/packages/debian-cd.

<p> Debian can be downloaded for free from any of our 
<a href="/distrib/ftplist">mirrors</a>.
