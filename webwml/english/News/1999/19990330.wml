#use wml::debian::news

<P>Debian's 2.1 distribution, now released, features integrated SGML,
XML, and DSSSL infrastructure and packages.  Debian's innovative SGML
subsystem positions Debian as a premier platform for SGML and XML
developers, offering a complete working toolset for documenters and
markup programmers with no manual setup required.

<P>Features:
<UL>
   <LI>James Clark's jade 1.2.1 and SP suite version 1.3.3,
   enabling validation and formatting of SGML or XML
   <A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/jade/">URL:http://www.jclark.com/jade/</A>.

   <LI>SGMLOpen shared system catalog integration (no need to manually
   register SGML Public Identifiers or set with environment
   variables).

   <LI>docbook (v3.0) and docbook-stylesheets (v1.13) available, providing
   an industry-standard markup convention

   <LI>psgml, which in conjunction with Emacs19, Emacs20, XEmacs19, or
   XEmacs20, provides a profession SGML editing environment.

   <LI>jadetex, combined with jade, facilitates the conversion of SGML to
   PostScript or PDF, for high quality printed output.

   <LI>a host of other SGML, XML, and DSSSL software packages are
   available, including but not limited to sgml-tools, expat,
   sdc, perlsgml, sgmlspm, and dsc.
</UL>

<P>We believe that Debian's open model of participation and committment
to system quality (as reflected in the Debian Policy
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/">
URL:http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/</A>) puts Debian
head-and-shoulders above other commercial or free systems.  SGML
integration efforts continue apace in the unstable distribution,
including DocBook 3.1, DocBk XML, TEI, and more DTDs.
