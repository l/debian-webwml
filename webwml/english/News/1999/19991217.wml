<P>Alpha Processor and The Linux Store have given a system on 'extended loan'
to Debian.  Lully is a dual Alpha 21264 (EV6) 667Mhz. with 512M of RAM.
Currently it has about 29G of SCSI storage, and will get another 29G, so
drive mirroring can be set up.  Its currently hosted by TheLinuxStore.com on
a dual T1.

<P>The system will be used to test Linux compatibility with the new UP2000
boards, and as a development platform for the debian-alpha team.
Additionally, it will host a Tier 1 Debian Mirror, and serve as a testbed
for experimental new archive structures and scripts.

<P>"At 16 minutes per compile of the GNU C Library, lully is by far the fastest
machine I've ever had the pleasure of using" said Joel Klecker, Debian GNU
LibC Packager.  A bootstrap compile of the gcc-2.95.2.tar.gz source took
just 30 minutes.

<P>The website for the board used in the system is available at
<newsurl http://www.alpha-processor.com/products/up2000-board.asp>

<P>Debian would like to thank these organizations for helping Debian by loaning
us this system, and welcome Lully into our community.
