<P>At the LinuxTag in Kaiserslautern we were contacted by Associated
Press (ap).  They wanted to release a few press messages containing
Debian.  Last week a correspondent from contacted Debian project
member Martin Schulze and compiled two press messages.

<P>Since both are written in German, we're giving a short english
summary.

<P>The article gives an introduction about Debian and explains some
  part of it's ideology.  The reader is told that about 500
  volunteers work on Debian and create over 3,100 binary packages.  He
  is told about the name and our non-commercialism.  Also explained is
  the social contract combined with a reference to the FSF.  It is
  said that quality is a high goal for Debian, the article is closed
  with a reference to Hurd.

  GNU/Linux and the resulting operating system compared with other
  vendors.  Mentioned is the glorious package management with ?dpkg?.
  This article is more detailed, it is surrounded by references to
