Strategic Alliance Between Corel, KDE and Debian to Advance Development of a
new Linux&reg; Distribution Corel on track to deliver easy-to-use Linux GUI and
OS to consumers and OEMs this fall
<P>
Ottawa, Canada - April 21, 1999 - Corel Corporation (NASDAQ: COSFF, TSE:
COS) today announced an alliance with two major Open Source developer
communities to advance the development of its proposed Linux&reg; distribution;
a user-friendly Linux installation and graphical user interface (GUI) for
the desktop PC.
<P>
Corel and the K Desktop Environment (KDE) Project will be working together
to enhance the KDE GUI for inclusion in the upcoming Corel version of
Linux,
aimed for the desktop user.
<P>
"Corel has chosen to work with KDE as our preferred desktop interface
because we believe its development is further ahead than other offerings at
this time," said Derek Burney, Corel's executive vice president of
engineering. "KDE can easily be configured to offer a strong Windows-like
look and feel, which we see as being very important to our strategy of
making all aspects of work in a Linux environment compatible with
present-day Windows offerings.
<P>
"Corel will also be releasing all its improvements and development on open
source software to the Open Source community," said Mr. Burney. "The
developers in that community are the strength of Linux, and with our recent
work and contributions to the WINE project, Corel strongly supports their
efforts."
<P>
"Our project's continuous dedication to create an attractive, stable and
functional desktop environment and Corel's experience in building
state-of-the-art graphical interfaces will help offer users an even better
experience with the award-winning KDE," said Cristian Tibirna, KDE's
representative in Canada. "We're all very excited about the new prospects."
<P>
Corel will also build its desktop Linux offering around the Debian
GNU/Linux
distribution, which already has one of the largest installed bases in the
Linux community, and is known for its stability and security.
<P>
"Debian has already made significant strides toward Linux on the desktop,
so
this is a natural partnership," said Erich Forler, Corel's Linux product
manager. "The Linux community has also recognized that Debian's Linux
distribution is built around extremely clean code, and their commitment to
documentation within their code, and for the applications, makes Open
Source
development more efficient and organized."
<P>
"I am very happy to see Corel taking this step into the Open Source world
and cooperating with non-commercial organizations such as Debian and KDE,"
said Wichert Akkerman, Debian's project leader. "By combining Debian's
strengths, which include having a large number of developers, a very open
development model and a public bug tracking system, with the experience
Corel has with making office and desktop products, I think we will be able
to produce an outstanding system with the best of both worlds."
<P>
With a recent strategic alliance with Cygnus, which will provide Cygnus
GNUPro software technology to enable Corel to move its market-leading
productivity applications to Linux, Corel is firmly on track to deliver its
proposed Linux distribution to the market by the fall. This will be in
advance of its WordPerfect&reg; Office 2000 for Linux productivity suite and
CorelDRAW&reg; 9 for Linux graphics application in the fourth quarter and
beginning of 2000 respectively.
<P>
The strength and popularity of Linux is growing steadily, everyday.
International Data Corporation (IDC) recently announced that through 2003,
total Linux commercial shipments will grow faster than the total shipments
of all other IDC covered client or server operating environments. IDC
estimates that Linux commercial shipments will increase at a compound
annual
growth rate (CAGR) of 25% from 1999 through 2003, compared with a 10% CAGR
for all other client operating environments combined and a 12% CAGR for all
other server operating environments combined.
