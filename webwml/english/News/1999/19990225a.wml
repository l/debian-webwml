 connection at Mindspring Enterprises' data center in Atlanta, Georgia to
 act as the new ftp.debian.org server.

 <P>Tony Copeland, Director of Sales and Marketing at LHS, said "As
 beneficiaries of the hard work and dedication of the Linux community we
 are glad that we could offer assistance to the Debian team and encourage
 the further development of Linux as a whole."

 <P>The server has a retail value of $6100 and has been custom configured to
 address the specific needs of the Debian team.

 <P>Linux Hardware Solutions President Kit Cosper said, "When we became aware
 that the Debian Project was in need of a new server we opened a dialog to
 determine how LHS could provide the maximum level of service and support
 to the dedicated people that constitute the Debian team.  After discussing
 the options we assembled a system to serve not only their present needs,
 but future expansion as well."
