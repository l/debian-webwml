<p>Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain, 22 July 2009 - Come 24 July, the city
of Cáceres in the autonomous community of Extremadura in western
Spain will be the temporary home for almost 300 attendees of the
annual conference of the Debian project. The Debian project is the
team behind the free and open-source Debian GNU/Linux operating
system.</p>

<p>The conference takes place at Residencia Muñoz Torrero, Ronda de San
Francisco, 2. The event is sponsored by HP, the government of
Extremadura, Telefonica and many other supporters. Registration is
required to attend this free event.</p>

<p>On Friday 24 July, the conference opens its doors to host talks and
presentations geared at the general public. Developers and users
will be on site to answer questions. No registration is required to
attend the open day, and everyone is welcome. Admission is free of
charge.</p>

<p>More information is available from the conference website,
<a href="http://debconf9.debconf.org/">http://debconf9.debconf.org/</a>.</p>

<p><q>The government of Extremadura is very supportive of free software,</q>
says C&eacute;sar G&oacute;mez Mart&iacute;n, a civil servant from Cáceres
and one of the local organisers. <q>In addition to our gnuLinEx initiative,
a complete computer software solution for all Extremadura schools
and official institutions built on Debian, we are keen to support
free software projects and events. We are happy to sponsor DebConf,
and excited to host the conference in the beautiful city of
Cáceres.</q></p>

<p>Prior to the conference, more than a hundred contributors to the
Debian Project gathered on-site to cooperate in solving problems and
adding features to the the computer operating system.</p>

<p>The personal interaction at such an event trumps Debian's usual
round-the-clock, global collaboration over the Internet. <q>The main
benefit of meeting in person regularly is improved communication due
to the better bandwidth through real-life interaction, a technology
which is also becoming quite popular in the wider Debian community</q>
says Debian developer Holger Levsen.</p>

<p>As an additional highlight a wine made from organically grown
Tempranillo grapes in Extremadura has been produced by the DebConf9
organisers to celebrate this event, and the use of free software in
the world. Debian and wine are made and enjoyed worldwide, as
expressed in the sentiment written on the bottle: <q>Share the wine,
share the software.</q></p>

<p>While DebConf is mainly focused on direct communication and
collaboration, participation for people abroad is also possible via
live video streams and IRC (Internet Relay Chat). As has been
happening since 2006, the world will be able to follow along as the
talks happen, and recordings will be made freely available for
download for those who miss the live sessions. See

for more information.</p>

<h2>About Debian</h2>
<p>Debian GNU/Linux is a free computer operating system. Over three
thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to create
and maintain Debian software. Translated into 27 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>

<h2>About DebConf</h2>

<p>DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a full
schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides an
opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to meet
in person and work together more closely. It has taken place annually since
2000 in locations as varied as Canada, Finland, and Mexico.</p>

<p>DebConf9 starts on Friday 24 July, and ends Thursday 30 July 2009. The
conference will be held in Cáceres, Extremadura, Spain.</p>

<p>DebConf will be preceded by DebCamp, from Thursday 16 July to Thursday 23
July 2009. DebCamp is a smaller, less formal event giving an opportunity for
group work on Debian projects.</p>

<p>On Friday 24 July 2009, DebConf Open Day will take place at the site. The Open
Day is a short conference aimed at Debian users, and others interested in
learning more about free software.</p>
