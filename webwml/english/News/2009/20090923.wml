<p>The Debian Project, the team behind the free Debian Linux operating
system, proudly announces the first Debian Mini Conference in Taiwan which
takes place 26th-27th September at Technology Building, Taipei City,
Taiwan(R.O.C.) during <a href="http://icos.org.tw/en">International
Conference on Open Source(ICOS) 2009</a>.
The ICOS 2009 is organized by the <a href="http://www.slat.org/">Software
Liberty Association of Taiwan (SLAT)</a>. Its aim is to bring international
FLOSS projects and developers together, so that they can share experience,
introduce projects and get in touch with local developers and users.</p>

<p>Participants from many Asian countries like China, Indonesia, Japan,
Taiwan, Thailand and overseas from Europe and Australia ranging from Debian
users, to contributors and official Debian Developers will gather together
to exchange knowledge and further improve Debian for their specific needs.
Topics include a <q>peak behind the curtain of Debian's archive</q> by
Debian's FTP Master, Jörg Jaspert; an <q>introduction to embedded
development</q>
using <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Embedded Debian</a> by Hector
Oron; as well as <q>Personal experience on <q>how to help Debian</q></q> by
Andrew Lee(&#26446;&#20581;&#31179;). A Special topic of interest is Skolelinux / Debian Edu, a
Debian pure blend optimising Debian for the usage in schools, for which
Jonas Smedegaard presents the projects history while Holger Levsen details
on how debian-edu has been widely used over the world.</p>

<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free, community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of the
largest and most influential open source projects.
Over three thousand volunteers from all over the world work together to
create
and maintain Debian software. Translated into over 30 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.</p>

<h2>About MiniDebConf</h2>

<p>A MiniDebConf is a Debian Project's developer conference, which is
smaller in the number of attendees compared to a full DebConf, which is
held annually by the Debian project. It still features a full schedule of
technical, social and policy talks, and thus a Mini-DebConf provides an
opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to
meet
in person and work together closely. Just like its bigger counter part, the
regular DebConf, Mini-DebConfs have taken place many times since 2000 in
locations from all over the world: Europe, America, Asia and Australia
continents.</p>
