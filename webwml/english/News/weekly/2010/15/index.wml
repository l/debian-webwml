<h2>Debian and <q>Google Code-in 2010</q></h2>

<p>After Debian has been successfully participated in the last <q>Google
Summer of Code</q>, where Google sponsored students during the summer
holidays to work on specific task for Open Source projects, a new
campaign for pre-university students is now started: the <a
href="http://code.google.com/intl/en/opensource/gci/2010-11/">Google Code-in
2010</a>.  In this new contest, pre-university students may work on
smaller tasks during one or two weeks, and in the end may win T-Shirts, money and other
prices.  Coordination is done again by <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2010/10/msg00342.html">Obey
Arthur Liu</a>, who already started a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/GoogleCodeIn2010">general wiki page</a> and
is now collecting <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/GoogleCodeIn2010/Tasks">tasks</a>.</p>

<h2>Report from openSUSE Conference</h2>

<p>
Gerfried Fuchs sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20101027075154.GA29575@anguilla.debian.or.at">report</a>
of the <a href="http://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Conference">openSUSE
Conference</a> where she has been representing Debian through a
talk about <q>Debian - The Project and its Resources</q> whose
<a href="http://deb.li/DebSuSE">slides</a> are available.
One topic raised was about package naming schemes, sometimes diverting from
upstream for consistency reasons, so inter-distribution tools would require
some layer to map the package name from one distribution to another.

<h2>Debian Installer 6.0 Beta1 release</h2>

<p>
The first beta release of the installer for Debian Squeeze has been
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/News/2010/20101030">released on
October 30th, 2010</a>.
This release is dedicated to Frans Pop, who was heavily involved in several
aspects of Debian Installer until he <a href="News/2010/20100831">passed
away</a>, and whose loss is deeply regretted.
</p>
<p>
Many improvements are added in this release of the installer: new
platforms (Marvell GuruPlug and OpenRD-Ultimate for example),
isohybrid images, and 67 languages are supported, and many more.
The <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">errata</a>
gather details and a full list of known issues.
You are welcome to test the installer and report bugs;
media and other information are available on the <a
href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer">Debian Installer pages</a>.
Especially, the new Win32-Loader should be tested
on all Windows versions for all languages.

<h2>Minutes from mini-DebConf Paris</h2>

<p>
The <a href="http://fr2010.mini.debconf.org/">first mini-DebConf Paris</a>
has just been held a week ago in the PPS laboratory of Universit&eacute; Paris 7.
According to Stefano Zacchiroli, it was a <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/10/mini_debconf_paris_-_success/">complete
success</a> gathering about 150 people from all over Europe.
Stefano finalized the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Sprints">Debian Sprint
Program</a>, and <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=593">Lucas
Nussbaum</a> worked on <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">UDD</a> and <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/collab-qa/debcluster/scripts/tasks/instest.rb">his
piuparts replacement</a> between <a
href="http://www.loria.fr/~lnussbau/files/minidebconfparis2010-debian-ubuntu.pdf">two</a>
<a href="http://www.loria.fr/~lnussbau/files/minidebconfparis2010-debian-qa.pdf">talks</a>.
The <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/BSP2010/Paris">Bug Squashing Party</a>

<h2>Mini-DebConf in Ho Chi Minh City</h2>

<p>
For the first time in Vietnam, the <a
href="(HOME)/News/2010/20101102">fifth mini-DebConf in Asia</a> will be
held during FOSSASIA 2010 in Ho Chi Minh City on November 12-14, 2010.
The mini-DebConf will feature talks from different Debian
Developers and contributers covering technical, social and policy
topics, as well as a translation workshop to foster the Vietnamese

<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianVietnam/MiniDebConf2010">organisation
page</a>.

<h2>Bits from the Website Team</h2>

<p>
Gerfried Fuchs sent some <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/11/msg00001.html">Bits
from the Website Team</a> in which she summarized the recent activities of the
team. Besides announcing that www-master was recently moved to another host,
she reported the progress made in the website redesign process.
Since several months, in fact, Gerfried Fuchs and Martin Zobel-Helas are working
on implementing the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/KallesDesign">Kalle
S&ouml;derman's proposal</a> for the new website design across different sites and
there are already available several previews: 
<a href="http://www.deb.at/">www.deb.at</a>, 
<a href="http://debienna.at">debienna.at</a>, 
<a href="http://dsa.debian.org/">dsa.debian.org</a>, 
<a href="http://git.deb.at/">git.deb.at</a>, 
<a href="http://lists.deb.at/">lists.deb.at</a>, 
<a href="http://packages.deb.at/">packages.deb.at</a>, and
<a href="http://planet.deb.at/">planet.deb.at</a>.
You can follow the further progress on the related <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/KallesDesign">wiki page</a> and help the team
testing new design with different web browser.
The mail ends with a call for further contributors, which are always welcome.
A lot of different things need to get done, and not all of them require
specific skills.
