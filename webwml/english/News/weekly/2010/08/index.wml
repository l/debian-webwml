<p>Welcome to this year's eighth issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<toc-display/>



<toc-add-entry name="debianday">Debian Day in New York coming up</toc-add-entry>

<p>The organisers of the DebConf10, the upcoming annual Debian Developer
conference, announced that there will again be a <a
href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf10/ms_dc10debianday.dc">Debian Day</a>
for everybody interested in free software.  It will be on the 1st of August at
the Columbia University in New York City. During this event, there will be a
full day of talks on several subjects such as free software in government,
design and free software, free software advocacy as well as string of talks
about the Debian project and operating system.  Debian Day is free of charge,
but a registration via e-mail is required to ease the organisation of that
event.  More information is available on <a
href="http://debianday.org/">http://debianday.org/</a>.



<toc-add-entry name="miniDebConf">Mini Debian conference in India</toc-add-entry>

<p>Kartik Mistry announced a <a
href="http://ftbfs.wordpress.com/2010/07/15/minidebconf-in-india/">mini Debian
Conference in India</a>. It will take place on 7th and 8th of August in
Pune.  Topics on the agenda range from an introduction of the <q>univeral
operating system</q> to a discussion about <q>Debian community
activities</q>.  A bug squashing party is planed as well. More details
are available in the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianIndia/MiniDebConf2010">Debian
wiki</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="di">Debian Installer beta1 coming up</toc-add-entry>

<p>Christian Perrier reported about the <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2010/07/19#di-squeeze-beta1-l10n">status
of the upcoming beta1 of the Debian Installer for <q>Squeeze</q></a>.  This
version has been translated into 65 languages, work for additional
languages is already on the way.  Christian also gave some tips on how
this beta may already be tested, although the packages haven't completely
migrated to Debian <q>Squeeze</q>, yet.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="twid"><q>This week in Debian</q> podcast?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli was contacted by Jonathan Nadeau,
who produces several podcast for the wider free software community, about <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/07/debian_podcast_planning/">creating
a podcast about Debian</a>.  This weekly podcast should interview
someone, who refers about a Debian related topic.  As Stefano emphasizes:
<q>Any Debian-related topic is a good candidate: a team, an initiative, a
general discussion about a relevant project aspect, etc. You don't even need
any particular upfront preparation, as it'll be interview-like.</q>
Coordination for that has already been started on a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian">wiki page</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="users">How to make Debian more attractive for Users?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20100720124149.GF6444@login2.uio.no">noticed</a>
that the number of submissions to Debian's <a
href="http://popcon.debian.org">Popularity Contest</a> (popcon for short)
is decreasing since some weeks.  Popcon is a system which anonymously
sends a list of installed software packages to Debian, which allows
Debian to prioritise their work (e.g. ordering of packages on installation
media).  Currently popcon isn't activated by default, so it was
discussed, if this should be done, and if there was a way to do that in
way not affect users privacy.  Soon the discussion turned into the topic
on how to <a href="http://lists.debian.org/4C46DD3B.5080805@gmx.de">make
Debian more attractive to users</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the ideas raised (beside others) where:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/4C46DD3B.5080805@gmx.de">offer phone support for Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/02905573d5290737d21b0f6fe761d612.squirrel@www.linux-dev.org">offer
CD/DVD images allowing the installation of non-free material</a> (such as firmware files; it later turned out, that this has already been implemented)</li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/AANLkTik1TYnUJvsCiN8DspD7GYYoEkVM5byOcrXiTwUk@mail.gmail.com">automatic backports of updated packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/20100721160822.GG12007@onerussian.com">improving Debian's webpage</a> (especially the front)</li>
  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/AANLkTinpA7yJqnfde4_lhVkvw8HhOXg2HHehoN0GX6Uw@mail.gmail.com">making it easier to submit bugs</a></li>
</ul>



<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>Raphaël Hertzog noted that the <a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/07/22/quick-news-dpkg-collab-maint-alioth-and-the-future/">upcoming
version of dpkg</a> &mdash; the core package maintenance tool &mdash; won't depend on perl
anymore thus making dpkg even more suitable for 
embedded systems.</p>

<p>Giuseppe Iuculano <a
href="http://www.iuculano.it/en/linux/debian/chromium-browser-vs-google-chrome/">pointed
some differences</a> between Debian's <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/chromium-browser">chromium-browser
packages</a> and google-chrome out.</p>

<p>The responsibilities of Debian's package maintainers, Debian's porters and
Debian's buildd administrators (who take care of systems automatically building
packages for specific architectures) has been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20100712180545.GA28403@scru.org">discussed</a> on
the general Debian project mailing list.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="newcontributors">New Developers and Maintainers</toc-add-entry>

One applicant has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/E1OZlXt-00051c-11@franck.debian.org">accepted</a>
as Debian Maintainer since the previous issue of the Debian
Project News.  Please welcome Antoine Beaupré into our project!</p>




<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

<p>According to the <a href="http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php">unofficial
release-citical bug counter</a>, the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
<q>Squeeze</q>, is currently affected by 348 release-critical bugs. Ignoring
bugs which are easily solved or on the way of being solved, roughly
speaking, about 152 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.</p>

<p>There are also <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/#2010-29">more detailed
statistics</a> as well as some <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats">hints on how to
interprete</a> these numbers.</p>
