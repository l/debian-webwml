<p>Welcome to this year's thirteenth issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="cut">An update on Constantly Usable Testing (CUT)</toc-add-entry>

<p>Rapha&euml;l Hertzog wrote a
detailed article on the <a
href="http://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/406301/e28612e7adae5653/">recent
activity surrounding the Constantly Usable Testing (CUT)
proposal</a>. CUT would be a Debian distribution based on testing, but with
significant differences that make it more usable, i.e. more polished
and stable. In the article he talks about the potential value of a
<q>rolling</q> release and how it might work.</p>
<p> A quote from the article: <q>The global proposal is certainly appealing: it would address the
concerns of obsolescence of Debian's stable release by making
intermediary releases. Anyone needing something more recent for
hardware support can start by installing a CUT and follow the
subsequent releases until the next stable version. And users who
always want the latest version of all software could use rolling after
having installed a CUT.</q></p>
<p>
CUT seems to represent an innovative evolution of Debian
distributions. While it holds much promise, it is a lot of work
especially since there is already so much work getting a stable
release actually released. There always seems to be a tension between
having a rock solid stable release, which many people rely on Debian
to provide, and a developer's toolkit with cutting edge programming
languages and libraries. Perhaps CUT can address this.
</p>
<p>
Please see also the current discussion on the <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/cut-team/2010-September/000152.html">CUT
team mailing list</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="ftpmasters">Bits from the FTPMasters</toc-add-entry>

<p>The FTP Team met two weekends ago in Fulda, Germany. While there appeared to
be a shortage of baklava, there was no shortage of Debian related work
and discussion. J&ouml;rg Jaspert in the meeting minutes made a call for
volunteers. Being an FTPMaster is a hard job and one that many people
inside and outside of Debian take for granted. 
Thanks very much for the hard work,
FTPMasters.</p>

<p>He also announced that <q>starting with <q>Squeeze</q>, the
volatile suite will be integrated into the normal <tt>ftp.debian.org</tt>
mirror tree. This weekend we enabled <tt>squeeze-volatile</tt> on <tt>ftp-master</tt>
and setup the needed scripts so that the volatile team can fill it
with packages whenever needed. Please note that the general
handling of volatile starting with <q>Squeeze</q> is now different to the
way volatile worked in the past. All packages now have to pass
<q>stable</q>'s <tt>proposed-updates</tt> queue before going into volatile.</q>
</p>
<p>J&ouml;rg went on to discuss a number of important topics - 
his <a href="https://lists.debian.org/87aan8rzo0.fsf@gkar.ganneff.de">mail
is quite detailed and has lots of valuable
information</a> - including the discussion of using a version control
system to <q>push</q> entire repositories to the <tt>ftp-master</tt> host.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="gsoc">Report about this year's <q>Google Summer of Code</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>Obey Arthur Liu wrote a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/4C972B40.3080903@milliways.fr">report about Debian's participation in this
year's <q>Google Summer of Code</q></a>, where Google pays students to work on
and with specific FLOSS projects.  Debian was accepted as a mentoring
organisation for the fifth time in a row.  Again it was a great success
with eight students completing their projects successfully.  He also quoted
some of the students' project reports.</p>

<p>The projects ranged from <q>Hurd port and de-Linux-isation of
Debian-Installer</q> through <q>debbugs bug reporting and manipulation API</q>
and <q>Aptitude Qt</q> up to <q>Debian-Installer on Neo FreeRunner and
handheld devices</q>.  You can find more details in <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/gsoc">the Debian wiki</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="pub">Bits from the Publicity Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian's Publicity Team posted <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100914103636.GS12469@melusine.alphascorpii.net">some
bits</a> informing Debian Developers, Contributors and the Community
how best to make contact with them and especially how to help.
Helping the team may range from assisting with the Debian Project News (you
do want to continue reading it, don't you?), proposing <q>dents</q> for
Debian's official <a href="http://identi.ca/debian">identi.ca account</a>,
or being available for a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian">This
Week in Debian</a> podcast.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>Joey Hess was quite pleased to see some of his tools being referenced
<a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/MovieOS_credit/">in a recent
movie</a>.</p>

<p>Russell Coker created a <a href="http://etbe.coker.com.au/2010/09/20/my-squeeze-se-linux-repository/">package repository for packages fixing SELinux
related bugs</a> for Debian <q>Squeeze</q>.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.debian.org/ports/hppa/">PA-RISC (aka
<q>hppa</q>)</a> architecture has been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/1285100542.20782.1123.camel@kaa.jungle.aubergine.my-net-space.net">dropped
as a release architecture</a> for Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>.  It will still be
available in Debian's <q>unstable</q> suite.</p>

<p>Thomas Lange <a href="http://news.debian.net/2010/09/28/fai-home-has-moved/">announced</a> 
the FAI project (Fully Automated Install) has received its own domain name at <a
href="http://fai-project.org/">fai-project.org</a> and all services (wiki, repositories) have been
migrated to use the new domain. </p>

<p>Release Assistant Mehdi Dogguy announced the agenda of the past weekend <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/4C9A5C3F.2080805@debian.org">meeting of the
Release Team</a>. One point on their agenda: <q>Check the state of
Squeeze</q>.</p>

<p>Continuing his blogs about how the annual Debian Conference is
organised, Richards Darst recently covered the topics <a
href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/10">The DebConf
travel sponsorship process</a> and <a
href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/9">How DebCamp
relates to DebConf</a>. Joey Hess gave some historical background in
his <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/DebCamp_origin_story/">DebCamp
origin story</a>.</p>

<p>Luca Bruno posted a <a
href="http://kaeso.wordpress.com/2010/09/21/report-from-the-debianubuntu-community-conference-ita-2010/">report
from the Debian/Ubuntu Community Conference, ITA 2010</a>.  As this
was the first Italian event organised by both communities, he
highlights: <q>This new kind of collaboration between our communities
was found to be really positive and more events have already been
drafted for the next year, including a translation sprint and a
contributors meeting.</q></p>

<p>Holger Levsen announced the availability of the first release candidate
of an updated <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/201009291835.31081.holger@layer-acht.org">Debian
Edu Lenny</a> version.  One of the most important features is an update of
the installer based upon the debian-installer used in Debian 5.0.6
<q>Lenny</q> adding newer hardware support.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="newcontributors">New Debian Contributors</toc-add-entry>

<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

	<p>According to the <a
href="https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search interface of the
Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>, is currently affected by
301 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
177 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
	release to happen.</p>

	<p>There are also <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/#2010-39">more detailed

	interpret</a> these numbers.</p>

<p>These statistics have recently been moved to a new data source, and are
not comparable with the statistics of the last issue.  Please read <a
