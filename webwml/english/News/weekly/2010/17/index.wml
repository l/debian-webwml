<h2>Updated Debian GNU/Linux: 5.0.7 released</h2>

<p>
A new <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20101127">update
for Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q></a> has been released.
Due to an issue with the preparation, the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/src:linux-2.6">linux-2.6</a> packages included
in this point release do not incorporate the security fixes released in <a
href="http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2110">DSA 2110-1</a>.
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2126">DSA 2126-1</a>,
which has just been released, includes the updates from both <a
href="http://www.debian.org/security/2010/dsa-2110">DSA 2110-1</a>
and the <code>linux-2.6</code> packages from this point release.
All other recent security updates have been
added as well as some fixes for critical issues.
New CD and DVD images as well as update CDs and DVDs are available.

<h2>Debian WWW Sprint</h2>
<p>     
Gerfried Fuchs announced an upcoming <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20101129165411.GA16334@anguilla.debian.or.at">Debian 
WWW Sprint</a> to finalise the last bits that are
needed to get the new design for the website happening.
The sprint will happen on the weekend of
December 17 to 19 in Vienna, Austria.
People interested in attending with a somewhat firm knowledge
of CSS are welcome to get in contact as soon as possible.
A <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2010/WwwSprint">preliminary
agenda</a> for the meeting is available.

<h2>ZFS support in <q>Squeeze</q></h2>
<p>
Robert Millan is pleased to announce that <a
href="http://robertmh.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/about-zfs-in-squeeze-2/">the
last missing patch for ZFS support has been added<a> to the official Installer.
This updates the already <a
href="http://robertmh.wordpress.com/2010/10/13/about-zfs-in-squeeze/">existing 
ZFS integration into the Debian Installer</a> we relayed less than <a
href="http://www.debian.org/News/weekly/2010/14/#13">two months ago</a>.
<br/>
This means that Debian <q>Squeeze</q> will be one 
of the first GNU distributions to support ZFS.

<h2>Interview with Debian Developer Colin Watson</h2>

<p>
Rapha&euml;l Hertzog published an <a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/11/25/people-behind-debian-colin-watson/">interview
with long-time Debian Developer Colin Watson</a>, who has been
taking care of <code>man-db</code> for more than ten years.
He has done a lot of work on the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer">debian-installer</a>,
especially the partitioner, and plans to design a new
interface to handle disk naming consistently for <q>Wheezy</q>.
He also works on GRUB 2, which may be the best opportunity to
<q>reduce the need for the current mass of boot loaders</q>.
Colin Watson also provides information about Ubuntu and
what persons he admires most among Debian developers.

<h2>Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</h2>

	<p>According to the <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search
        interface of the Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>, is currently affected by
246 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
79 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
	release to happen.</p>

<p>Alexander also noted that the number of release-critical bugs needing to be solved in
<q>Squeeze</q> <a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/2010/12/06#2010-48-wow">dropped by a
stunning 40 bugs in just one week</a>!</p>

	<p>There are also <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/#2010-48">more detailed
	statistics</a> as well as some <a
	href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats">hints on how to
	interpret</a> these numbers.</p>
