<p>Welcome to this year's sixth issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<toc-display/>



<toc-add-entry name="rt">Bits from the Release Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Release manager Adam D. Barratt sent <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/1276539279.17274.84.camel@kaa.jungle.aubergine.my-net-space.net">Bits
from the release team</a>, in which he welcomes Mehdi Dogguy to the team.
Other enthusiastic Debian Developers who are interested are invited to <a
href="mailto:debian-release@lists.debian.org">contact the team</a>.
</p>

<p>
Lots of transitions are finished, and in order to make the boot process faster,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/E1OFQyk-0003Vs-Hw@login1.uio.no">parallel 
booting should be enabled by default</a>. <q>Squeeze</q> will release with
GNOME 2.30 along with the already transitioned KDE 4.4.3. With EGLIBC 2.11
already in <q>testing</q>, Python 2.6 and Perl 5.12 (among a few others)
should be able to transition before the freeze.
</p>

<p>
As announced earlier, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/1273229773.27856.14429.camel@kaa.jungle.aubergine.my-net-space.net">new
transitions are in freeze</a> in order to make it easier to finish current and
already scheduled transitions. <q>Squeeze</q> will be frozen when Python 2.6
and the other transitions are completed, maybe during late August if everybody
works together.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dc10">Call for volunteers for DebConf10</toc-add-entry>

<p>Gabriella Coleman sent out a <a
href="http://gabriellacoleman.org/blog/?p=2001">call for volunteers for
DebConf10</a> on her blog. She mentioned a <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Jobs#Conference_volunteers">list of things
that DebConf needs from volunteers</a>, so if
you are in New York or environs you might consider helping out if something on 
the list matches your skills and interests. There is also an amazing <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf10/TouristActivities">list of
free events</a>, events that take place before, during and after
DebConf. The list has theatre, movies and music as well as other types of events
to choose from; during DebConf alone there are free concerts from Gil Scott Heron
and Basia Bulat, just to name a couple. 
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="live">Debian Live Web Images Builder</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Daniel Baumann <a
href="http://blog.daniel-baumann.ch/2010/06/20#20100620_debian-live-webbuilder">announced</a>
that thanks to outstanding Debian Live contributor Richard Nelson
a <a href="http://live-helper.debian.net/">live-helper
web-frontend of the Debian Live Project</a> is now available: it lets users get
their own customised images without needing to install <a
href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-helper">live-helper</a> and build
them on their own.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="poll">Results from the Debian community poll</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Torsten Werner published the <a
href="http://twerner.blogspot.com/2010/06/results-from-debian-community-poll.html">results
of his Debian community poll</a> (followed by a <a
href="http://twerner.blogspot.com/2010/06/more-results-from-debian-community-poll.html">second
part</a>) and thanks all participants. With over 80% answering that they do not
contribute directly to Debian, this is the biggest ever survey of Debian's user base,
giving hints on how Debian should deal with its non-free section,
its release policy, and
the importance of the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> to its user base.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="fai">FAI workshop 2010</toc-add-entry>

<p>Michael Prokop mentioned on his blog that there will be an <a
href="http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2010/06/22/fai-developer-workshop-2010/">FAI
workshop at the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany</a>. FAI stands for <q>Fully
Automated Install</q> and is an important tool when dealing with large numbers
of computers, for example. As Michael writes: <q>As the name states the workshop
is targeted towards FAI developers. We &mdash; the FAI developers &mdash; want
to get FAI into shape for <q>Squeeze</q>, discuss pending issues like
Ubuntu packaging, release management and of course meet in real life for networking
and socialising.</q> Sounds like fun.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="rmll">Debian Project at LSM/RMLL 2010</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Project will be represented at the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100618">Libre Software Meeting /
Rencontres Mondiales du Logiciel Libre (LSM/RMLL) event in Bordeaux, France,
this year</a>. Debian related talks have been organised, as well as a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/BSP2010/Bordeaux">Bug Squashing Party (BSP)</a>.
Everyone interested in helping Debian is welcome at the BSP; there will be
enough developers around to sponsor your NMUs.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="lenny">Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q> updated</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100626">fifth update of
Debian's stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 (codename <q>lenny</q>)</a>
has been released.  This update mainly adds corrections for security problems
to the stable release, along with a few adjustments for serious problems.
Further updates include the Linux kernel itself as well as
debian-installer.

provide prerequisites in a community-compatible way, with a process
that includes announcements before the meeting and minutes after.

file to boot a system. The packages available should work on all Debian systems
and should be checked on a wide variety of platforms.
</p>

<p>
Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/06/Debian_consultancy_for_the_European_Framework_Programme/">reported</a>
