<h2>Linux Mint Debian Edition</h2>

<p>Linux Mint, a Linux distribution whose purpose is to <q>produce a
modern, elegant and comfortable operating system which is both
powerful and easy to use</q>, has released an edition based on Debian.
This new Linux Mint distribution will track Debian testing, as
a more reliable upstream base. Linux Mint appears
to be a popular Linux distribution ranking highly at DistroWatch.com as
well as other non-scientific measures. Certainly they received a large
number of comments to their <a
href="http://www.linuxmint.com/blog/?p=1527">blog post</a>
regarding their new 
distribution. Anecdotal evidence seems to point to this Debian-based
edition as a popular move. </p>
<p>The addition of Linux Mint to the Debian derivatives family is a
welcome one, and should the Linux Mint developers wish to be in
contact with Debian it has been suggested that they will be warmly welcomed
at the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">Debian
Derivatives Front Desk</a>.
</p>

<h2><q>Grave</q> software bugs</h2>
<p>Andreas Tille began a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20100909094049.GB4649@an3as.eu">short
discussion</a> regarding bugs which are not
grave software bugs <em>per se</em>, but could cause grave harm to life or
property under certain conditions. As an example, the bug in question
involved improper data handling that could lead to a medical patient
being prescribed medicine which could lead to a possibly fatal
reaction. Responses from developers indicated that despite such bugs
not being explicitly mentioned in the bug guidelines, they should
already fall under release-critical severity and thus should have
freeze exceptions and possible Debian Security Advisories if needed.
The fix for the bug in question was approved for testing within the
day.</p>

<h2><q>This week in Debian</q> interviews Stefano Zacchiroli</h2>

<p>Jonathan Nadeau published the first issue of the <q>This week in
Debian</q> podcast!  The podcast is available in <a
href="http://www.frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/rss/twid.ogg">Ogg Vorbis</a> format as
well as <a href="http://www.frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/rss/twidmp3">MP3</a>.
In this issue he interviewed Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli about
Debian influence in the Linux universe and its link with upstream and
derivative developers.
Stefano also spoke about the Debian Project and its organisation,
and more specifically the Debian Project Leader tasks.
</p>
<p>Congratulations, Jonathan, and thanks for your work!  We are looking forward to
hearing new issues of your podcast!</p>

<h2>etch-backports gone</h2>

<p>Alexander Wirt announced that the backports for Debian <q>Etch</q> have
finally been removed from the servers. Over the lifetime of etch-backports
there accumulated a total of 508 different backports, resulting in more than
2250 binary packages for all Debian architectures offered to users.
Altogether the available backports and their source occupied 13Gb of
disk space on the mirrors. The backports team would like to thank every 
contributor and mirror administrator for their work and their help which 
made this possible.</p>

<h2>Release-critical bugs in stable release</h2>

<p>Gerfried Fuchs <a
href="http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/2010/09/10#lenny-900-RCs">noticed</a> that
recently the number of release-critical bugs in the stable release Debian
5.0 <q>Lenny</q> has dropped below the 900 mark, and thanks all who helped
keeping that number down.  It should be noted that the high number of
open release-critical bugs for the stable release contains a fair amount
of false positives (e.g. serious <q>fails to build from source</q> bugs
with newer compiler versions that aren't shipped in the stable release).
Previously Gerfried blogged about <a
href="http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/on-BTS-usage.html">usage of
the Bug Tracking System</a>.
If you would like to join the efforts of keeping the bug tracking system
clean, please read this post and contact Gerfried should any questions
arise.
</p>

<h2>Debian Women Mentoring rebooting</h2>

<p>Helen Faulkner noted that the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/4C886864.7020906@debian.org">Debian Women
mentoring project</a> has been restarted.  People interested in being a
mentor or getting a mentor should <a
href="mailto:mentoring@women.debian.org">contact the coordinators</a>.</p>


<a name="7"></a>
<h2>Mythbusting Ruby packaging</h2>

<p>After hearing some myths about how Ruby is packaged in Debian, Lucas
Nussbaum wrote about <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=566">some of the
Ruby myths</a> in his blog.  It ranges from general version culture and API
stability, over the necessity of package splits, performance issues and
porting issues up to communication with the upstream developers and
motivation issues.  He also noted that due to these problems it's
difficult to find new people to join the Ruby packaging teams, and that
they are quite understaffed.</p>

<p>
In response to this initial post, <a
href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=575">some people
volunteered to help</a> on Ruby's packaging, so Lucas updated
the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Ruby">corresponding
wiki page</a> for guidance.
</p>


<a name="8"></a>
<h2>Debian to welcome non-packaging contributors</h2>

<p>In coordination with Debian's Account Managers, Debian Project Leader
Stefano Zacchiroli <a href="http://lists.debian.org/20100914085346.GA9209@upsilon.cc">proposed</a> a <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2010/vote_002">general resolution</a> to welcome non-packaging
contributors as full project members.  While the Debian Account Managers
already are empowered to do so, and while it is already possible to become
an official Debian Developer without doing packaging work, this procedure
has rarely been used.  So Stefano wants to make a clear sign from the entire
project that Debian does welcome and honour non-packaging contributions.
This goal has already been achieved partly, as Stefano's proposal got a lot
of support in quite a short time-frame.  However, the naming of
non-packaging contributors as well as possible upload rights are under
discussion.</p>

<h2>Other news</h2>

<p>Stephan Gran posted some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20100906202630.GB22450@varinia.lobefin.net">notes from the meeting of Debian System
Administrators</a> in early September in Munich.  Besides some internal discussion
(e.g. monitoring and configuration management), this also led to a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20100906170305.GQ25990@anguilla.noreply.org">procedure
for the handling of guest accounts on debian.org machines</a>.</p>

<p>Joerg Jaspert posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/87zkvtbmd3.fsf@gkar.ganneff.de">policy
for how Debian Developers can get their account names changed</a>.</p>

<p>Robert Millan announced the availability of the <a
href="http://robertmh.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/graphical-installer-for-debian-gnukfreebsd/">graphical
installer for Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>.</p>

<p>Rapha&euml;l Hertzog <a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2010/09/09/can-debian-achieve-world-domination-without-being-on-facebook/">wondered</a>
whether the Debian project shouldn't have an official page on
some non-free web service. Stefano Zacchiroli <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/09/yes_we_can/">disagreed</a>
on the grounds that it would not be possible to use a proprietary service without
endorsing it.</p>

<p>
Christian Perrier addressed his <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2010/09/12#release-team">thanks
to the release team</a> and encouraged every developer, whether their
package is unblocked or not, to send private <q>thank you</q>
messages to any Release Team member for their amazing work.
</p>

<p>
Miriam Ruiz is grateful towards the release team who agreed to unblock <a
href="http://www.miriamruiz.es/weblog/?p=610">Gnash 0.8.8 in Debian
<q>Squeeze</q></a>, which is by far a better option than the buggy 0.8.7.

Among the improvements in the version that will be shipped in the next Debian stable
release, lots of online video will now be working, it can switch at runtime
between the Cairo, OpenGL, and AGG renderers, and it can use hardware acceleration.
</p>

<p>
Luca Falavigna thanked everyone (especially Moritz Muehlenhoff) taking the trouble
to file removal bugs on the <tt>ftp.debian.org</tt> pseudo-package, in order to <a
href="http://dktrkranz.wordpress.com/2010/09/12/less-cruft-for-a-better-release/">clean
up unused and buggy packages from the archive</a> in order to prepare the
upcoming Debian <q>Squeeze</q> release.
</p>

<p>
FTP Master Joerg Jaspert, in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/87wrqkjrkl.fsf@gkar.ganneff.de">short
minute from the FTP Team meeting</a> being held this weekend,
welcomed Torsten Werner as new FTP Master.<br />

Good luck and congratulations to him!
</p>

<p>
Christian Perrier is pleased to announce that <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2010/09/09#samba-3.5.4">the
upload of Samba 3.5.4 to <q>Sid</q> has been authorised by the
release team</a>.

He therefore asked for users and system administrators to test the
new packages and report bugs in order to make this version a
quality one to be provided in <q>Squeeze</q>.
</p>

<p>
Lucas Nussbaum <a href ="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=571">added</a>
a <a href ="http://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugs.cgi">bugs search interface</a>
to the <a href ="http://udd.debian.org/">Ultimate Debian Database</a>.<br />
It thus may replace the <a
href="http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php">unofficial release-critical
bugs tracker</a>, while providing many more features.
</p>

<p>A <a
href="http://www.itp.tuwien.ac.at/~mattems/blog/2010/08/28#klibc_1.5.20">new
version of <tt>klibc</tt></a> has been released.  This newer klibc release fixes
ipconfig, which is responsible for netbooting, a method that is quite often
found in larger cluster environments or bigger Debian deployments. ipconfig
saw several fixes in order to procure more reliable netboot.</p>

	release-critical bug counter</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>, is currently affected by
317 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
126 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
	release to happen.</p>
