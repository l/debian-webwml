<p>Welcome to this year's seventh issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<toc-display/>



<toc-add-entry name="bsp">Bug Squashing Party in Munich</toc-add-entry>

<p>Michael Banck <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100707175939.GA3744@nighthawk.chemicalconnection.dyndns.org">announced
a Bug-Squashing-Party</a> in Munich over the weekend of the 17th and 18th
of July. The BSP will again take place at the LiMux Project Office in the city
centre.  See the wiki page for <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/BSP2010/Munich">further information and
directions</a>.</p>

<p>Contributions by non-DDs are welcome; the BSP will be attended by
several Debian Developers who will be able to upload fixes.  Michael Banck
will again try prepare an introductory session on Friday evening for people who
have not attended a BSP before.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="debianday">Organise a <q>DebianDay</q> in your city?</toc-add-entry>

<p>With Debian's 17th birthday coming up on <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6">August
the 16th</a>, the wider Debian community all over the world is invited to
organise local <q>DebianDay</q> gatherings and one-day conferences for
users, contributors and developers.</p>

<p><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay2010">Information and
tips</a> are available in the Debian wiki, which already also contains some
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDayArtwork">DebianDay
Artwork</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="listmasters">Bits and request for help from the listmasters</toc-add-entry>

<p>Listmaster Martin Zobel-Helas <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100702221307.GA25104@ftbfs.de">requested
help</a> in maintaining Debian's mailing lists.  Some topics which should be
addressed are the MHonArc scripts which generate the web archive (mixing code
and design, making it difficult to make any changes to the design) and the
constant work on improving the spam filters and cleansing the archive of
received spam.  Martin noted that the <a
href="svn://svn.debian.org/svn/pkg-listmaster/trunk/spamassassin_config">spam
filtering rules</a> are publicly accessible, and welcomes hints on how
to improve them. Last, but not least, he mentioned that when subscribing to
Debian mailing lists you should avoid bouncing spam which made it
through your filters.  Listmasters would prefer such spam from
liszt.debian.org to be discarded.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="fai">Report from FAI workshop 2010</toc-add-entry>

<p>From 2nd of July to 4th of July the <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> workshop in Linuxhotel
Essen/Germany took place. Nine FAI developers/users met to discuss
and work on FAI in preparation for the Debian <q>Squeeze</q> release. A report about the meeting
is available <a
href="http://michael-prokop.at/blog/2010/07/08/report-from-fai-developer-workshop-072010/">on
Michael Prokop's blog</a>.</p>

<p>The FAI developers want to thank the sponsors (Debian, Linuxhotel, Linux
Information Systems AG, Netways, Spotify, Thomas-Krenn.AG) for funding the
developer meeting.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> is a
non-interactive system to install, customise and manage Linux systems and
software configurations on computers as well as virtual machines and chroot
environments, from small networks to large-scale infrastructures and
clusters.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the Debian Project Leader</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent a new <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100627213423.GA20648@upsilon.cc">bits
from the DPL</a> report.  He mentions several conferences he was invited
to as well as interviews published in different media.  He also talks
about the recently <a
href="http://www.debian.org/News/2010/20100629">founded <q>derivatives
front desk</q></a>, which is a central place for Debian derivatives to
discuss collaboration with the Debian Project.   As there haven't been
enough volunteers for the team declassifying the archive of the
private Debian mailing list, he just documented the the status of the
implementation of <a
href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2005/vote_002">that general
resolution</a>.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="design">Website redesign progress</toc-add-entry>

<p>Quite some time has passed since Kalle SÃ¶derman created a <a
href="http://www.kalleswork.net/projects/debian/">proposal for
a redesign of Debian's webpresence</a> (including subdomains, like the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/">wiki</a>
and the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">mailinglist archive</a>).
However, recently <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100621072114.GA30254@anguilla.debian.or.at">quite a
lot</a> <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100621223002.GE1974@ftbfs.de">has
happened</a>, with prototypes of the <a
href="http://www.deb.at/index.en.html">new
design</a> being tested at the <a href="http://git.deb.at/">Git
webfrontend</a>, the <a href="http://lists.deb.at/">mailing lists
webfrontend</a> and the <a href="https://dsa.debian.org/">internal wiki of
Debian's sysadmin team</a>.  While some bugs in different browsers
remain and need to be fixed, it looks promising!
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dc12">DebConf 12 will be held in... your country?</toc-add-entry>

<p>With this year's <a href="http://debconf10.debconf.org/">annual Debian
Conference</a> coming up, Gunnar Wolf, one of the organisers of the Debian
Conference <a
href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20100626.163252.16c1e90a.en.html">encouraged</a>
people to think whether they would like to host the Debian Conference in the
year 2012 in their city.  As proposals are accepted till the end of the
year, working on such proposals should start soonish, which can be
presented at the upcoming conference. Please see the <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf12">DebConf wiki</a> for
information.</p>

<p>In related news, Stefano Zacchiroli announced the <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2010/06/welcome_DebConf_newbies/">results
of the DebConf Newbie initiative</a> and noted that there is still need
for more money for DebConf travel sponsorship to bring even more Debian
Contributors to the upcoming conference in New York City.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="Skolelinux">Report from the Skolelinux project in Rhineland-Palatinate,
Germany</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian Developer Philipp Huebner gave a report about the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/4C230E40.10704@debian.org">state of the
Debian-Edu based distribution for schools in the federal state
Rhineland-Palatinate</a> in Germany.  To ensure the sustainability of the
installations it was decided that documentation and developed features
should be integrated into the official Debian Pure Blend Debian-Edu /
Skolelinux.  That's similar to what has been done with features developed
for the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20100624081405.GB5733@login1.uio.no">Debian
based installations in the Extremadura, Spain.</a></p>



<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>Ritesh Raj Sarraf <a
href="http://www.researchut.com/blog/archive/2010/07/08/systemtap-in-debian">noticed</a>
that the recent upload of the Linux kernel adds support for kprobe,
making SystemTap, a tool to monitor Linux kernel internal data, a much more
useful instrument.</p>

<p>Cyril Brulebois from Debian's <q>X Strike Force</q> called for help
testing the <a
href="http://ikibiki.org//blog/2010/07/04/We_need_you_redux/">xserver-xorg-video-intel
driver</a> for Intel based graphic cards.  As they are considering
introducing version 2.12 of the driver, after the last two versions contained
quite a few regressions, any reports about working setups or noted
regressions would be quite helpful.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="newcontributors">New Developers and Maintainers</toc-add-entry>

<p>Four applicants have been <a href="https://lists.debian.org/E1OT1hh-0001zw-Gp@merkel.debian.org">accepted</a>
as Debian Developers and two applicants has been <a href="https://lists.debian.org/E1OTQCx-00054Y-P6@ries.debian.org">accepted</a>
as Debian Maintainer since the previous issue of the Debian
Project News.  Please welcome Thomas Goirand, Georges Khaznadar, Adrian
Perez, Felipe Sateler, Deepak Tripathi and Stefan VÃ¶lkel  into our project!</p>



<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

<p>According to the <a href="http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php">unofficial
release-critical bug counter</a>, the upcoming release, Debian 6.0
<q>Squeeze</q>, is currently affected by
401 release-critical bugs.
95 of them have already been fixed in Debian's <q>unstable</q> branch. Of the remaining
306 release-critical bugs,
49 already have a patch (which might need testing) and
16 are marked as pending.</p>

<p>Ignoring these bugs as well as release-critical bugs for packages in contrib or non-free,
163 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.</p>
