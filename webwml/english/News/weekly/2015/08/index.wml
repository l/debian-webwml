<toc-add-entry name="newdpn">Welcome to the <q>New</q> Debian Project News!</toc-add-entry>

<p>We hope that you enjoy our first newly revised issue of the DPN. We have shifted 
some of the content around, introduced new sections, and moved some content 
onto the <a href="https://bits.debian.org/">Bits from Debian</a> blog.</p>

<p>Bits from Debian will showcase new packages and interviews, plus some announcements,
and is where we will welcome new DDs.</p>

<p>We are planning to send more short news items via our social network account.
Please be sure to follow us on <a href="https://identi.ca/debian">identi.ca/debian</a>
(or fall back to the non-official mirrors in other social networks).</p>

<p>One of the major changes is the removal of the DSA security advisories from 
the newsletter. Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily
basis (<a href="$(HOME)/security/2015/">Security Advisories 2015</a>), so
please read them carefully and take the proper measures.</p>

<p>If you need to be kept up to date about security advisories released by the 
Debian Security Team, please
subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">security mailing
list</a> (and the separate <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/">backports
list</a>, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/">stable updates
list</a>, and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/">long term
support security updates list</a>) for announcements.
</p>

<p>We are simplifying and (we hope) improving the <q>help needed</q> section. 
From now on, you will find:</p>

<ul>
 <li>links to packages needing help, </li>
 <li>links to bug reports tagged <q>newcomer</q>,</li>
 <li>calls for help from teams in coordination with the Welcome Team,
 tailored for first-time contributors.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Translators and reviewers needed!</b></p>

<p>Help us make Debian (the software, the community) speak your language!
Less than an hour every once in a while - even just a couple of
minutes - can make a difference. </p>

<p>If you speak a language other than English, you can join the team for
your language and contribute to Debian with translations
and reviews of other people's translations. </p>

<p>Reviewing translations made by other contributors is particularly needed
(to ensure their quality) and easy (no technical skills needed, just language skills).
</p>

<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Welcome/Translators">Welcome Translators</a> wiki page.

<p>Steve McIntyre posted a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2015/09/msg00233.html">summary of the ARM ports BOF at DebConf15</a>. He details
and asks questions about armel in Stretch and Debian's sole support of older

The sprint covered workflow patches in git (especially git-debcherry), and held several
discussions on minor issues in scripts, new tooling to import changes, and 
work on several individual packages. They were also able to do bug triaging,
repository cleanup, and update examples of pkg-perl-tools. During DebCamp and 
DebConf, 189 packages were uploaded with 19 bugs closed.</p>

new version of Hercules, a z/Architecture emulator. </p>
