<toc-add-entry name="debinst">First Alpha versions for Stretch Debian installer</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Cyril Brulebois
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/07/msg00005.html">announced</a>
that the first Alpha version of the installer for Debian 9 <q>Stretch</q>
had been released. Shortly afterward the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00005.html">second version</a>
was released live from the DebConf Birthday Party in Heidelberg, Germany. He posted <a
href="http://mraw.org/blog/2015/07/22/D-I_Stretch_Alpha_1/">on his blog</a>
a quick recap of the beginning of the development cycle of the installer for Stretch, and <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00004.html">announced</a>
that the migration to testing of packages producing the special <tt>udeb</tt>
packages used by the installer would be frozen just before the release of
a new version of the installer. He also asks the maintainers of packages
with potential changes to the installer for coordination through the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot">debian-boot</a> mailing list.

<toc-add-entry name="bye-squeeze-sparc">Archive changes: SPARC architecture removed from the archive, Squeeze moved</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Joerg Jaspert <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/07/msg00006.html">announced</a>
that support for the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/sparc/">SPARC architecture</a>
has been removed from the official archive.
The support of SPARC was introduced with Debian 2.1 <q>Slink</q>.
Andrew Carter shared <a href="http://flosslinuxblog.blogspot.de/2015/07/bye-sparc-for-now.html">his memories</a>
of SPARC in Debian.

He also <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00009.html">announced</a>
that due to disk space limitations on mirror hosts, the non-LTS   
architectures of Squeeze were removed from the mirror network. Squeeze i386/amd64 
will continue to be hosted on the normal mirrors, while the whole of Squeeze is 
available at <a href="https://archive.debian.org/">archive.debian.org</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="uefi">New Debian UEFI team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve McIntyre <a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/08/02#new_debian_uefi_team">announced</a>
on his blog the creation of a
<a href="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/uefi/">UEFI team</a> in Debian,
using the freshly opened <tt>#debian-uefi</tt> IRC channel on
<tt>irc.debian.org</tt>. The team is welcoming new members interested in
helping with these packages and UEFI in general.
Steve also reported the beginning of a
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/08/02#tracking_broken_UEFI_implementations">cross-distribution
effort</a> to track broken UEFI implementations. If you have a particular UEFI
horror story, add details to
<a href="http://wiki.osdev.org/Broken_UEFI_implementations">the dedicated wiki
page</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="freedombox">FreedomBox 0.5 released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
James Valleroy
<a href="https://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/freedombox-discuss/2015-August/006831.html">announced</a>
the release of FreedomBox version 0.5. The
<a href="https://freedomboxfoundation.org/">FreedomBox Project</a>
is a community effort to develop, design, and promote personal servers
based on Debian running free software for private personal communications.
More information about this version is available in the

<toc-add-entry name="gcc5">Bits from the release Team: GCC5 as default, transition thereof</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Jonathan Wiltshire sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00000.html">message</a>
about the way package maintainers can help the transition to GCC5 and
libstdc++6, which can be tracked on the 
<a href="https://release.debian.org/transitions/">transition tracker</a>. They
are asked to defer uploads to unstable where possible, unless they are
related to this transition - for example, fixing a FTBFS with GCC5, or other
RC bugs to unblock migration, or related to the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=libstdc%2B%2B-cxx11;users=debian-gcc@lists.debian.org">libstdc++ follow-up transitions</a>.
They are welcome to work in experimental in the meantime.
Matthias Klose focused on the transition <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00002.html">for
the libstdc++6 ABI</a> with an emphasis on what should be done, or not!
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="perl">Bits from Perl maintainers: Transition to Perl 5.22</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Niko Tyni <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00010.html">announced</a> a Perl transition to Perl 5.22, expected in the
next couple of months. Perl 5.22 packages have been in experimental since
June, and the list of blockers is <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=perl-5.22-transition;users=debian-perl@lists.debian.org">getting shorter</a>.
Some changes occurred in the organisation of the binary packages built from
src:perl version 5.22 in experimental to allow for keeping older versions of
libperl5.xx installable, and for marking them Multi-Arch:same so that they
can be co-installed for multiple architectures. In order not to increase the
number of packages, the non-essential parts of the standard library have been
integrated into the libperl5.xx package. As a side effect, installing
libperl5.xx now installs the full Perl standard library.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="Buildbit">Bits from the Wanna Build team: Buildd status</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/08/msg00007.html">Wanna
Build team met</a> at DebCamp welcoming Joachim Breitner as a new member.   
They quickly got to work on getting arch:all packages buildable with their 
autobuilders, and they remind developers that they are <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-wb-team/">available</a> if a package
does not make it through the ftp-master archive. The team continuted work on 
merging buildd.debian-ports.org into buildd.debian.org, and did a front end 
update to the <a href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/">buildd status pages</a>. 

The team also focused on rsync based uploads from the buildds, upgraded their 
autobuilders to Jessie and discussed package archives for project members.  The 
team plans to work on cross build dependencies, workflow regarding communication
between the autobuilders, and working toward stateless autobuilders. 

The team gives special thanks to the DSA and ftp-master teams.

Simon Kainz
<a href="http://blog.familiekainz.at/duck-challenge-at-debconf15.html">announced</a>
and updated the weekly <a href="http://duck.debian.net/">DUCK</a> challenge
to help find, fix, and upload packages with DUCK issues before the end of DebConf15.
Prizes and notoriety aside, the tallies for
<a href="http://blog.familiekainz.at/duck-challenge-week-1.html">Week 1</a>:
10 fixes and uploads.
<a href="http://blog.familiekainz.at/duck-challenge-week-2.html">Week 2</a>:
15 fixes and uploads. 
<a href="http://blog.familiekainz.at/duck-challenge-week-3.html">Week 3</a>:
10 fixes and uploads, with an impressive pause to acknowledge 35 packages
by 25 different people thus far.
<a href="http://blog.familiekainz.at/duck-challenge-week-4.html">Week 4</a>:
14 fixes and uploads.
</p>

<p>Gregor Herrmann <a href="http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archive/2015/07/">reported</a>
on RC bugs worked on in early July as part of the   
GCC5 transition, and work with the Debian Perl Group's upstream releases.</p>

<p>Niels Thykier worked in the background on <a href="https://lintian.debian.org/">Lintian</a> and applied some <a
href="https://nthykier.wordpress.com/2015/07/18/performance-tuning-of-lintian/">performance
tuning</a>, with the output monitoring process being made available
on-line. The set of changes, such as an increase in buffer size, along
with various memory optimisations, brought memory
consumption down 33%. A <a
href="https://nthykier.wordpress.com/2015/07/20/performance-tuning-of-lintian-take-2/">second
tuning</a> concentrated on field definitions which  
further reduced memory use and when applied saw reductions in size for 
libreoffice and chromium at 55% and 61% respectively. </p>

<p>John Goerzen wondered about better password storage with readily available means 
such as a USB stick or other secure hardware, which led him to blog about his 
<a href="http://changelog.complete.org/archives/9358-first-steps-with-smartcards-under-linux-and-android-hard-but-it-works">first
steps with smartcards under Linux and Android</a>. He followed this with a

<p>The Reproducible Builds team is proud to <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~lunar/blog/posts/reproducible_builds_stretch_week_17/">report</a>
on over 65 packages fixed in the 17th week of the Stretch cycle; they also share their <a
href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2015/debconf15/Stretching_out_for_trustworthy_reproducible_builds_creating_bit_by_bit_identical_binaries.webm">talk</a>

<p>
<a href="https://www.freexian.com/">Freexian</a>, sponsor of Debian Long Term Support (LTS), highlighted
73.50 work hours in their <a href="https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/07/16/freexians-report-about-debian-long-term-support-june-2015/">June report</a>

2015 report</a>, spread in each case among 7 paid
contributors. July's work listed 20 packages awaiting an update with about 22 
packages in a vulnerable state, down from 33 the previous month. During DebConf15
LTS was featured in a talk, and video is available of two presentations:

<p>
Raphaël Hertzog <a href="https://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/07/31/my-free-software-activities-in-july-2015/">reported</a> on 15 hours of paid support working on Debian LTS and 
his jump ahead to the future to work on Kali Linux / Debian Stretch. The work 
with Kali Linux is to parallel Debian Constantly Usable Testing with a rolling 
release cycle and snapshot for every 4 months toward 3 releases per year. Bugs 
closed on the Kali side of work benefited Debian with improvements to APT, 
upstream requests for nvidia drivers, and the investigation of a schroot 
issue.   In his other time Raphael sponsored packages, uploaded his own
packages, and worked on the Distro Tracker.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://carlchenet.com/2015/08/03/my-free-activities-in-july-2015/">Carl
Chenet</a> worked on <a
href="https://github.com/chaica/retweet">Retweet</a>, a Twitter bot that automatically
re-tweets posts, nearly completed the full localisation of 
<a href="https://infos.mytux.fr/">Le Journal du hacker</a> into
French, and submitted a pull request for additional sources for
planet.sysadmin-fr.org. Carl also worked on several bug reports for 
Dockier.io and Backupchecker.

<p>
Antonio Terceiro <a href="http://softwarelivre.org/terceiro/blog/elixir-in-debian-minidebconf-at-fisl-and-debian-ci-updates">introduced</a>
his readers to Elixir and plans for its use in
Debian; interested parties are encouraged to join or hang around in #debian-elixir
on irc.debian.org. Antonio helped organise a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/br/2015/MiniDebconfFISL">MiniDebconf</a> in
Porto Alegre which targeted bringing more participants into Debian; he spoke 
about <q>What is Debian, and how it works</q> and packaging free software. Videos of
his talks are available <a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2015/mini-debconf-fisl/">here</a>.
Antonio is also helping to organise 
another MiniDebConf in October as part of <a href="http://latinoware.org/">Latinoware</a>. Antonio also worked on the 
transition to Ruby 2.2 as the default in Debian unstable, and uploaded 
updates to unstable which reached testing.
</p>

<p>Ritesh Raj Sarraf <a href="http://www.researchut.com/blog/linux-containers-with-systemd">blogged</a> on a few topics discussed at a Micro Debian Developers
meeting regarding cross compilation, licensing from the point of view of the
end user, and systemd. Container groups held a fair amount of discussion time
in consideration of how they work within systemd. He shares an example of
using systemd-nspawn as a replacement for Linux Containers (LXC).</p>
