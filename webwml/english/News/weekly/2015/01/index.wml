<toc-add-entry name="ARMS">A brief history of the arm64 port</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve McIntyre walks us through a
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/01/06#bootstrapping-debian-arm64">brief
history of the Debian ARM port</a>.
</p>
<p>Now an official release architecture for Jessie, arm64 took many years
and a lot of CPU time considering the over 21,000 source packages available.
From the inception of the port, developers struggled for accessible hardware
and were only able to work on it using ARM's AArch64 software models, until 
the folks running the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tianhe-2">Tianhe-2 supercomputer</a>
project in China contacted the team to offer access to their arm64 hardware.
</p>
<p>
Later as <a href="http://www.arm.com/">ARM</a> started producing its
own <q>Juno</q> development boards, Debian
Developers were able to acquire some for use as official Debian build
machines. The Juno buildds ran well and with them a large portion of the
Debian archive was built; however, suitability issues begin to arise with
using them all over the world and with many developers using them for debugging 
the new architecture. Things progressed as best they could until Linaro, with a 
goal of helping to improve FOSS  on ARM, came to the aid of the project with a 
<a href="http://www.linaro.org/leg/servercluster/">cluster of
servers</a> made available for software developers to use to get early
access to ARMv8 hardware.
</p>
<p>
Debian was able to negotiate dedicated access to three of the machines from the
cluster in October of 2014, with two of the machines serving as build machines 
and the other as a porter box.  Developers now had the necessary hardware in 
place to race against the small amount of time left before the freeze of Jessie.
</p>
<p>
They did just that at the Cambridge mini-DebConf in November of 2014 where ARM
was officially added to the list of release architectures.
Since that time Steve has managed to obtain another arm64 machine on loan from
AMD to Debian to use for further porting and building. He expects that as more
vendors move from prototype to production, more hardware will become available,
and hopes to see ARM running not just in your server rooms, but on your
desktops and laptops. Running Jessie of course.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="di-rc1">First release candidate of Jessie Debian Installer</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Installer Jessie RC1 release has been
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/01/msg00005.html">announced</a>.
Changes include checks for missing firmware, the official artwork for Jessie, the
renaming of 486 to 586, and an updated mirror listing. Other items of note are language
support for 75 languages, a PXE-bootable grub.efi, imx6 support and netcfg interface.d
support. The Debian Installer team extends a Thank You to all the people who 
contributed towards this release. The team also extends a call for help for 
testers to help find bugs in
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer">all media available</a>.

<p>
Yasuhiro Araki, who has provided cdn.debian.net since February of 2008, is
planning on
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/2014/12/msg00000.html">orphaning
the project</a> in light of the more recent
<a href="http://http.debian.net">http.debian.net</a>.
As he begins the process DNS for cdn.debian.net will eventually point to 
http.debian.net.
Thank you Yasuhiro for the many years of service.
</p>
<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2015/20150206">announce</a> a new

<toc-add-entry name="LTS">Debian Long Term Support</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Freexian's fifth
<a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/01/16/freexians-fitfth-report-about-debian-long-term-support/">report</a>
about Debian Long Term Support showed that in the month of
December 46 work hours were split among four paid LTS contributors. Compared to the
month of November the number of paid hours has not increased from the allotted 
48 hours per month. Starting this year, 2015, with more sponsors the team hopes
to have an increase in available funding, towards the goal of funding the 
<a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">equivalent
of a half-time position</a>. Security updates in LTS held close to the
same numbers are last month with 30 packages awaiting an update affecting
around 56 packages in total.
</p>

<p>
Thorsten Alteholz
<a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2015/01/my-debian-activities-in-december-2014/">updated</a>
his LTS status for December for which he was assigned 20.5 hours towards LTS.
He used the time to upload new security updates to 14
packages including flac, tcpdump, jasper, unzip, and many others. Thorsten
sponsored the upload of an ettercap security update, which may be the
first non-Debian Developer patch for LTS, for which he thanks Nguyen Cong and Toshiba.
</p>

<p>
Raphaël Hertzog
<a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2015/01/05/my-free-software-activities-for-december-2014/">blogged</a>
about his December 2014 LTS work: he was assigned 20 hours of LTS work
which was spent on CVE triage with 47 commits to the security tracker,
two fixes for wishlist bugs and several releases of which the biggest was
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2014/12/msg00022.html">DLA-120-1
on xorg-server</a> which took over 6 hours to backport, but fixed 12 CVEs.
Raphaël created a dedicated
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Funding">funding subpage</a> on the LTS wiki,
which now gives more information to interested parties and opens up the project for
more companies to get involved in and to contribute to. The new page fixes what
may have been an erroneously implied relationship between Freexian as an LTS 
sponsor and the Debian project. 
</p>

<p>
Ben Hutchings
<a href="http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/debian-lts-work-december-2014.html">posted</a>
his LTS summary with 11.5 hours of support on LTS and an update to the
kernel package <a href="https://packages.qa.debian.org/l/linux-2.6.html">linux-2.6</a>,
version
<a href="https://packages.qa.debian.org/l/linux-2.6/news/20141209T000621Z.html">2.6.32-48squeeze9.</a>
The LTS team had been working with and using an older kernel with applied security and
critical fixes until a recent shift to rebase packages on the 2014 2.6.32.64
release. Ben reviewed and applied fixes and security flaws for the kernel for
 upstream inclusion into 2.6.32.65.

<toc-add-entry name="grtc">Debian members vote to limit Technical Committee Term</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian members were
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/12/msg00010.html">called
by Kurt Roeckx</a>, Debian secretary, to vote on a general resolution to change
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">Debian Constitution</a>, and create
term limits for Technical Committee members. Both proposals aimed at
creating a regular turnover of Technical Committee members, by enforcing a
term limit of about four years. The proposals differed in the way they respond to
resignations or removals of TC members for reasons other than the term limit. The
first option, which could result in more than two TC members leaving the TC
during the same year, won the <a

<toc-add-entry name="gsoc">Call for projects and mentors for Debian GSoC 2015</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Nicolas Dandrimont asked all Debian contributors for
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/02/msg00006.html">projects
and mentors</a>
to help Debian participate in the eleventh year of the
<a href="https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/">Google Summer of Code</a>.
<q>Everyone (member of the Debian project or not, student or not) is welcome to
submit their ideas, and to try and find people willing to mentor the projects</q>,
explained Nicolas in his mail.

If you have an idea, please publish it on the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2015/Projects">wiki page</a>,
and send an email to the
<a href="mailto:soc-coordination@lists.alioth.debian.org">coordination mailing list</a>.

You can also contact Nicolas and the other GSoC administrators for Debian on
their mailing list or on their IRC channel, #debian-soc on irc.debian.org.

<toc-add-entry name="reproducible">Progress on reproducible builds</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The reproducible builds team
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2015/02/msg00007.html">sent
a report</a> about their work, which enables anyone
to independently confirm that a given Debian binary package was indeed built
from some specified source package. Currently, more than 83% of all the source
packages in the main archive of the unstable distribution can be built reproducibly.
The team developed the tool
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/debbindiff"><tt>debbindiff</tt></a> to
provide in-depth detailed diffs of binary packages. Packages are then built
twice on <a href="https://jenkins.debian.net">jenkins.debian.net</a>, and
reproducibility results are reported on the
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org">Debian Package Tracker</a>. The team is considering
submitting a proposal to make reproducible builds a release goal for Stretch, the
next stable release after Jessie.

<p>
A mini-DebConf took place at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay).
The conference was opened by Professor Kumar Appaiah from the Electrical Engineering
department. Other notable speakers included Kannan Moudgalya, head of the Free and Open Source
Software for Education (FOSSEE) project. Among the topics discussed were open source software security,
Debian on ARM by Siji Sunny, and Raspbian (Debian on Raspberry Pi). A total recap of topics and
discussions can be found on

<toc-add-entry name="keyring">2048-bit key removal from Debian keyrings</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The keyring-maint team is proud to announce that, after almost five
years of actively requesting stronger keys to be used for the project,
and after a four months intensive campaign to speed up the key
migration, as of January 1 we have disabled all PGP keys weaker than
2048 bits.
</p>
<p>
A full list of affected keys together with the requisites and
instructions on how to submit a new key for Debian is

Jingjie Jiang, our OPW (Outreach Program for Women) intern,
<a href="http://sophiejjj.wordpress.com/2014/12/29/week2-week3-opw-journey/">posted</a>
a progress report on her work on
debsources. Several bugs were fixed and are to be merged into the codebase,
such as allowing symbolic links within the same version, and override
detection. She has also been working towards making debsources available on
sor.debian.org, and provided some thoughts on

<p>
Niels Thykier gave an
<a href="http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/status-on-jessie-december-2014/">update</a>
on the status of Jessie as of December of 2014. Currently
there is no set release date and there is still much work to be done. He reminded users and
developers of the
<a href="https://release.debian.org/jessie/freeze_policy.html#autoremovals">automatic
removal clause</a> that was about to go into effect; any package with
a dependency on a threatened package may itself be at risk. Work on the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/jessie/releasenotes">release
notes</a> still needs more time and hands. While the number of bugs is
declining there are still a few problematic bugs to be solved.
</p>

<p>
At this time only RC bug fixes are being accepted.
Help is requested! Users can file bugs against the
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/release-notes">release notes</a>
concerning missing or outdated documentation, fix the known RC bugs
that are

Steve McIntyre's work on UEFI support in Jessie continued with a series of posts on getting an
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/01/02#Jessie-EFI_3">i386-only UEFI net install</a>
up and running (and made available with test images to download), then a
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/01/06#Jessie-EFI_4">mixed 32- and 64-bit UEFI net install</a>
(available for testing and download), and later work on
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2015/01/11#Jessie-EFI_5">integration of 32-bit grub-efi</a> with
patches to the Linux kernel, grub2 for /sys and a grub-installer patch. Steve's
last update was in mid-January of 2015, when he also announced a pause in
development in favour of a few other items that need work such as RC bugs, sorting
Mac-only 32-bit images, and debian-live images.

his Free Software Activities for January 2015, including
12 hours of paid work on Debian LTS which had work done on libnokogiri-ruby and on
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555">pound-related
SSL issues</a>. He also submitted bugs reports for the Tryton application platform,
created three Salt
formulas for Saltstack, packaging for upstream releases of Django in experimental 
along with a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/775892">pre-approval</a>, and an unblock request for Dolibarr
with input from the security team. Raphaël also worked on soliciting candidates for
Debian France's election for a third board member.

<p>
Thomas Goirand gave an
<a href="http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=237">update</a> on
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/OpenStack">OpenStack</a> image
availability letting us know that it is
now generated at the same time as the official Debian CD ISO images. He suggests
cloud users and public cloud operators should
<a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/openstack/testing/">download</a>
the now available weekly build.
Presently the only arch available is arm64, which historically has not been 
a problem for operators. Goirand adds a few suggestions and comments for the 
image generation and included sources.tar.gz file. Contributors and testers 
are welcomed.
