<p>Welcome to this year's 1st issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community. This issue is dedicated to
<a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2008/20081229">Thiemo Seufer</a>, who died on 26
December 2008 in a tragic car accident.</p>

<p>Topics covered in this issue include:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="CDbits">Bits from the Debian CD team</toc-add-entry>

<p>Frans Pop sent <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00002.html">Bits from the Debian CD team</a>,
summarizing various changes affecting the installation media for the
upcoming release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q>.<br /><br />
The most notable change is the replacement of the Xfce installation disc
with a <q>light desktop</q> installation disc for installing Xfce or
LXDE. Furthermore, all four major desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, Xfce
and LXDE) are directly installable from the first DVD image; the desktop
environment to be installed can now be chosen via the boot menu.</p>

<p>The Debian CD team still plans to create the following images:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Architecture-specific images:
    <ul>
      <li>businesscard CD</li>
      <li>network install (netinst) CD</li>
      <li>full CD (650 MB) images &mdash; users can now choose between:
        <ul>
          <li>standard CD set, which will by default install GNOME</li>
          <li>special KDE CD</li>
          <li>special light desktop environments CD (LXDE + Xfce)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>DVD set</li>
      <li>Blu-ray image (only as jigdo files for i386, amd64 and
source)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Multi-architecture images:
    <ul>
      <li>alpha/hppa/ia64 network install CD</li>
      <li>i386/amd64/powerpc network install CD</li>
      <li>i386/amd64 DVD; also includes source packages</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<toc-add-entry name="DIbits">Bits from the Debian Installer team</toc-add-entry>

<p>Christian Perrier <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00013.html">sent</a>
bits from the Debian Installer team.  With the upcoming release of Debian
GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q> in mind, he summarized the improvements made during
this release cycle, including (but not limited to) support for loading
firmware during installation, SATA RAID support, early upgrade of
packages for security fixes, support for <q>volatile</q>, a new boot menu for
i386/amd64, and support for installation from Windows through
win32-loader.</p>

<p>He also mentioned that the next release candidate version is intended to
be the version used in the Lenny official release. This version will fix
a few bugs discovered in Release Candidate 1 (RC1) and a few more which
were listed in RC1 errata. The team intends to begin the final release
process of Debian Installer RC2 in the very early days of January
2009.</p>

<p>He also stresses the need for new blood to join the Debian Installer team
after Lenny has been released, since out of the 180 people with commit
access only three have been active in the coordination list and IRC
channel during the last three months.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="GR">Results from the <q>Lenny release GR</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>Bdale Garbee <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00000.html">posted</a> the results of the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2008/vote_003"><q>Lenny release GR</q></a>, a
general resolution about the handling of firmware issues and similar bugs
affecting Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q>.</p>

<p>From all the proposed options, the one titled <q>Assume blobs comply with
GPL unless proven otherwise</q> won.  With this outcome, the Debian project
now assumes that <q>source less</q> firmware (rather small programs that
internally control various electronic devices, see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware">Wikipedias Page about
Firmware</a>) has been created the way it is
(without a source in a higher level programming language) and therefore
fullfils the requirements of the GNU General Public License. </p>



<toc-add-entry name="search">New maintainer for search.debian.org needed</toc-add-entry>

<p><a href="mailto:tv@beamnet.de">Thomas Viehmann</a> is
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2009/01/msg00024.html">seeking</a>
a new maintainer for <a href="http://search.debian.org">search.debian.org</a>.
The search engine is a slightly patched xapian-omega instance.  You should
be a Debian Developer or be willing to be part of a team for access to
the installation. Some more improvements to the language support are
desirable, which involve some C++, but Thomas would try to help out
there.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="security">Security support for next testing (Squeeze)</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Testing Security Team
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-security-announce/2008/12/msg00019.html">announced</a>
that security support for the next Debian testing
(codenamed <q>Squeeze</q>) will not begin immediately after the release of
Lenny as stable. Users of Debian testing who need security support should
stay with Lenny until the beginning of security support for Squeeze is
announced.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="i18n">Internationalization support for planet.debian.org</toc-add-entry>

<p>Jörg Jaspert <a
href="http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/12/21/planet-i18n.html">announced</a>
that <a href="http://planet.debian.org">planet.debian.org</a>, a service
collecting the personal blogs of various Debian Developers, Maintainers
and other Debian-associated people, is now capable of hosting web pages
and RSS/Atom-feeds in different languages, as demonstrated by the <a
href="http://planet.debian.org/es/">Spanish Planet Debian</a>.</p>

<p>Adding a new language is quite simple but requires at least ten feeds to
be added for the newly created language.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="secretary">Personnel change of the Debian Secretary</toc-add-entry>

<p>Due to criticism while conducting the recent <q>Lenny release GR</q> vote,
Manoj Srivastava, long term secretary of the Debian Project, decided to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00765.html">resign</a>
from this position. Following his resignation many developers
have thanked him for his work.</p>

<p>Debian Project Leader Steve McIntyre is now
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00011.html">searching</a>
for volunteers for this position, while Bdale Garbee,
current Chairman of the Technical Committee, is now
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/12/msg00801.html">serving
as Acting Secretary</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="TC">Personnel changes in Debian's Technical Committee</toc-add-entry>

<p>After being member of Debian's Technical Committee for three years,
Anthony Towns
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/2009/01/msg00006.html">resigned</a>
from that position to get fresh blood into the committee.
We would like to thank Anthony for the work he has done over the past
years.</p>

<p>Bdale Garbee, current chair of the Technical Committee,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/01/msg00003.html">announced</a>
that Russ Allbery and Don Armstrong have been added to the
technical committee.  Please join us in congratulating them on achieving
this level of recognition and trust within our community.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="NM">Personnel changes in the New Maintainer front desk</toc-add-entry>

<p>Christoph Berg
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/12/msg00010.html">announced</a>
some personnel changes in the New Maintainer front desk,
handling applications of people interested in becoming Debian Developers.
Marc Brockschmidt, who has been a member since 2005, has resigned from
this position, while Bernd Zeimetz has joined the team.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Marc for his long term dedication.</p>

<a href="http://nm.debian.org/gpg.php">GPG Key Signing Coordination</a>, a

Debian developers who can sign their key for the ID part of the NM
maintainer process. It's not much work; a description of the tasks can be

<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

<p>According to the <a href="http://bts.turmzimmer.net/details.php">unofficial
RC-bugs count</a>, the upcoming release Debian GNU/Linux 5.0
<q>Lenny</q> is currently affected by 99 release critical bugs.  26 of them
have already been fixed in Debian's <q>unstable</q> branch. Of the remaining
73 release critical bugs, 15 already have a patch (which might need
testing) and 12 are marked as pending.</p>

<p>Ignoring these bugs as well as release critical bugs for packages in
contrib or non-free, 49 release critical bugs remain to be solved for the
release to happen.</p>
