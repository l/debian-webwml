Subject: package pools implemented on ftp-master

Hi,

Well, it wasn't quite days[1], but ftp-master is now using package
pools.  Apart from strange mails and anyone poking around on
ftp-master itself, you probably won't notice the difference until the
next mirror pulse (in about 20 hours time).  Despite the relative
catastrophe-free implementation on non-US, I suspect many more
problems will crop up in the main archive.  As before, please report
any problems with uploads or with the archive in general.

Joey Hess has prepared an excellent FAQ on Package Pools; please read
it first, if you have any questions:
