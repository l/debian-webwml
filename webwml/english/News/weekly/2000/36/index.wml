<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

<p>
The Powerpc port will soon have no build daemon for unstable. That is not a
good state of affairs, and Daniel Jacobowitz wants to use some of the
Debian project's funds to buy a new machine to be used as an autobuilder
and for some other tasks (20001030200453.A16345@drow.them.org). 
Interestingly, if this happens it might be the  first time we have used 
project money to buy a machine -- they are usually donated, and our money 
is used for other expenses. All responses were favorable.
