<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
Progeny has <a href="http://www.progeny.com/debian/">announced a public 
beta test</a> of Progeny Debian, "<i>an open source, commercial version of 
Debian</i>". According to the press release, "<i>Progeny Debian features a 
new installer, as well as new tools for administration, configuration and
package management</i>" An announcement made to debian-devel
(20001031163845.D18868@indy.progenylinux.com) provides more details:
They have modified several Debian packages to add Gnome interfaces, so their
package management is done via "gtasksel", a modified tasksel, and package 
configuration makes heavy use of Debconf with a Gnome frontend. Other
features include XFree86 4.0.1, hardware autodetection, and GRUB.
Progeny Debian is based on unstable, 
and "<i>has been tested thoroughly by Progeny's developers</i>" -- as 
such, once it comes out of beta and is released, it might serve as a useful
upgrade for those who need unstable's features but cannot deal with daily
upgrades and breakage.

Joey Hess posted () 20001101201152.E7105@kitenet.netthe first weekly
debian-installer status report, detailing what progess is being made on the
new Debian installer, and listing the many parts that have yet to be
written.

The Powerpc port will soon have no build daemon for unstable. That is not a
good state of affairs, and Daniel Jacobowitz wants to use some of the
Debian project's funds to buy a new machine to be used as an autobuilder
and for some other tasks (20001030200453.A16345@drow.them.org). 
Interestingly, if this happens it might be the  first time we have used 
project money to buy a machine -- they are usually donated, and our money 
is used for other expenses. All responses were favorable.
