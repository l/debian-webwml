<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>XFree86 4.0.1 has
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0011/msg00160.html">
entered unstable</a>.</b> The new version of X took significant effort to 
package -- Branden Robinson worked on it nearly full time for "<i>about 4 
months</i>", reorganizing the entire set of packages, waiting for security
holes to be fixed, and producing some 50 test releases to work out all the 
kinks. The result is a surprisingly polished upgrade (by unstable's standards 
anyway -- <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/branden@debian.org">many 
problems</a> are still being encountered).
</p>

<p>
<b>A slightly less polished upgrade involving perl 5.6 and dpkg 1.7.0 has
also hit unstable.</b> A bug in the update-alternatives provided by the new
version of dpkg <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/76438">broke perl</a> for a
while, and though the problem is at least partly
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00002.html">
resolved by now</a>, many smaller problems are still being dealt with.
Unstable seems likely to live up to its name for the next week or two.
</p>

<p>
<b>The new version of dpkg</b> has 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00003.html">
several new features</a>, including support for marking the origin of a
package for use by third party .deb creators like HelixCode that should
allow bugs to be directed to the right place, a "<i>statoverride</i>" 
mechanism that allows overriding the permissions of any file on the system 
across upgrades, an improved dpkg-shlibdeps, and a new
<tt>/etc/dpkg/dpkg.cfg</tt> config file.
</p>

<p>
<b>Progeny has <a href="http://www.progeny.com/debian/">announced a public 
beta test</a> of Progeny Debian</b>, "<i>an open source, commercial version of
Debian</i>". According to the press release, "<i>Progeny Debian features a
new installer, as well as new tools for administration, configuration and
package management</i>" An announcement posted to debian-devel
provides <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg02219.html">more 
details</a>: They have modified several Debian packages to add Gnome interfaces,
so their package management is done via "gtasksel", a modified tasksel, and
package configuration makes heavy use of Debconf with a Gnome frontend. Other
features include hardware autodetection and GRUB. Progeny was asked if their 
enhancements will be contributed back to Debian, and 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00029.html">responded</a>
"<i>Yes, at the discretion of the Debian maintainers of the relevant 
packages.</i>" Progeny Debian is based on unstable, and "<i>has been tested 
thoroughly by Progeny's developers</i>" -- as such, once it comes out of beta,
it might serve as a useful upgrade for those who need unstable's features but
cannot deal with daily upgrades and breakage. (See also: 
<a href=../../oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/debianplanet/article.php?sid=28">an
article on Debian Planet</a> about Debian and commercial variants.)

<p>
<b>The first in a series of weekly debian-installer status reports</b> was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00092.html">released</a>,
detailing what progress is being made on the new Debian installer, and 
listing the many parts that have yet to be written.
