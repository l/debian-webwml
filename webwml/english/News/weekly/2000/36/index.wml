<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
Progeny has <a href="http://www.progeny.com/debian/">announced</a> a public
beta test of Progeny Debian, "<i>an open source, commercial version of
Debian</i>". According to the press release, "<i>Progeny Debian features a new
installer, as well as new tools for administration, configuration and package
management</i>" Debian Weekly News asked Progeny for some details: They have 
modified several Debian packages to add Gnome interfaces, so their package
management is done via "gtasksel", a modified tasksel, and package
configuration makes heavy use of Debconf with a Gnome frontend. Progeny
Debian is based on unstable, and "<i>has been tested thoroughly by
Progeny's developers</i>" -- as such, once it comes out of beta
and is released, it might serve as a useful upgrade for users
who need unstable's features but cannot deal with daily upgrades and
breakage.
</p>

<p>
The Powerpc port will soon have no build daemon for unstable. That is not a
good state of affairs, and Daniel Jacobowitz wants to use some of the
Debian project's funds to buy a new machine to be used as an autobuilder
and for some other tasks (20001030200453.A16345@drow.them.org). 
Interestingly, if this happens it might be the  first time we have used 
project money to buy a machine -- they are usually donated, and our money 
is used for other expenses. All responses were favorable.
