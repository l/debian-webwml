<b>VA Linux is offering Debian preinstalled on their 2200 line of servers.</b>
While VA is not the first company to sell computers with Debian
pre-installed, they are perhaps the largest company to do so to date.
The <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/001011/bw0094.html">press
release</a> quotes Larry Augustin saying, "We are proud to begin providing 
Debian on our 2200 series servers and look forward to offering the Debian 
option on more of our systems"
VA also announced last week (** find url **) that they have hired DPL 
Wichert Akkerman, who joins 3 other Debian developers at VA
(disclaimer: one of those three is the author of this newsletter).

Debian GNU/Hurd CD images have been created
(Pine.BSO.4.21.0010121830010.24257-100000@k2.jozsef.kando.hu)
and Philip Charles provided some details about them.
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1001012220752.29929B-100000@stephen)
They are based on the Debian boot-floppies, so linux is used to install the
Hurd, and "<i>in theory Hurd can be installed on any system that will accept
a potato installation, whether Hurd will run on all these systems is
another issue.</i>" This looks like a big step forward in usability for 
the Hurd.

How debian-user stopped a spammer. Someone asked on the debian-user mailing list
for reccomendations for software that would enable him to "<i>work with
big archives of mailadresses and need a program that is able to send SPAM</i>"
(002901c0355c$e6bbbae0$f68ae195@arcor). Needless
to say, he received no concrete suggestions, but lots of mail about why
spamming is not a smart idea. The amazing thing is that this proto-spammer
seems to have taken this advice to heart.
