<b>VA Linux is offering Debian pre-installed on their 2200 line of servers.</b>
While VA is not the first company to sell computers with Debian
pre-installed, they are perhaps the largest company to do so to date.
The <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/001011/bw0094.html">press
release</a> quotes VA's CEO (** check, is Larry CEO? *****) as 
saying, "We are proud to begin providing Debian on our 2200 series 
servers and look forward to offering the Debian 
option on more of our systems"
VA also announced last week (** find url **) that they have hired DPL 
Wichert Akkerman, who joins 3 other Debian developers at VA
(disclaimer: one of those three is the author of this newsletter).

<b>Debian GNU/Hurd CD images</b> have been created
(Pine.BSO.4.21.0010121830010.24257-100000@k2.jozsef.kando.hu)
and Philip Charles provided some details about them.
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1001012220752.29929B-100000@stephen)
They are based on the Debian boot-floppies, so linux is used to install the
Hurd, and "<i>in theory Hurd can be installed on any system that will accept
a potato installation, whether Hurd will run on all these systems is
another issue.</i>" This looks like a big step forward in usability for 
the Hurd.

<b>A puzzling Debian review</b> was published a few weeks ago, when Joe Barr 
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-09/lw-09-vcontrol_2.html">
reviewed Debian 2.1</a> in LinuxWorld. Yes, 2.1, released a good year ago. It
was not a nice review; memorable quotes include "<i>the install from hell</i>",
"<i>toughest install Linux has to offer</i>", and "<i>This distribution is 
supposed to be the poster child for free software; it should be on an FBI Most
Wanted poster.</i>" There was a large and on the whole quite puzzled reaction
on the Debian mailing lists. Why was someone harshly reviewing an old version
of Debian?
</p>

<p>
<b>This puzzle was cleared up</b> when Joe Barr produced a
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-2000-10/lw-10-vcontrol_2.html">
new review</a>, this time covering Debian 2.2. Seems he picked up the older
version at a trade show and didn't realize it was out of date -- an honest
mistake. The new review is much kinder, featuring quotes like "<i>Unlike my
Slink experience, this time my RealTek 8139 driver was there and installed 
very quickly.</i>", "<i>then it was as easy as typing apt-get install 
task-helix-gnome</i>", and "<i>depending on my mood, I would say the Potato
install is somewhere between 'sucks less' and 'needs improvement'</i>". He 
still concludes that "<i>the Debian install is the most difficult Linux 
install I've seen</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>Taken together, these two reviews are very interesting</b> because here
Debian 2.1 and 2.2 have been reviewed by the same person, at about the same
time, and held to the same standard. It's nice to see 2.2 come out 
significantly ahead of 2.1. Many people have a rough time with their first 
Debian install and go on to become fans of this distribution, and there are
hints in the second review that the reviewer is taking some steps down that
path. And Debian clearly has a way to go before it will satisfy those who
demand absolute ease-of-use -- if that is a goal we want to aim for.

<b>How debian-user stopped a spammer.</b> Someone asked on the debian-user 
mailing list
for reccomendations for software that would enable him to "<i>work with
big archives of mailadresses and need a program that is able to send SPAM</i>"
(002901c0355c$e6bbbae0$f68ae195@arcor). Needless
to say, he received no concrete suggestions, but lots of mail about why
spamming is not a smart idea. The amazing thing is that this proto-spammer
seems to have taken this advice to heart.
