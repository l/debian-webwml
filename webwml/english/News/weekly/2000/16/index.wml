<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
No Debian Weekly News was published last week because there was little to
report on, except indecision (20000515202239.A23800@xs4all.nl) about what to
do about the first test cycle. The test cycle started slowly, and various
problems (20000515135352.H22524@xs4all.nl) prevented it from being very
effective. Perhaps the most importany thing we've learned from this test
cycle is we were not prepared to get a release candidate ready in time.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, it's became clear that we need another test cycle anyway.
Adam Di Carlo wrote (oa66sfz6pf.fsf@arroz.fake) that "<i>We need a release
kernel, not a a pre-release kernel.  We need to fix some rather nasty
problems in boot-floppies</i>". And so Richard Braakman plans
(20000519172724.A21706@xs4all.nl) to end the current test cycle on the 24th,
and start another one on the 29th. In preparation for that, he plans to
<i>remove most of the packages that have release-critical bugs from potato</i>
on the 25th and 26th.
</p>

<p>
Here's an update (20000515155754.A543@polynum.com) on plans for the First
Debian Conference in France, which is being held as part of the Libre
Software Meeting. RMS will be there to talk about the HURD, and Wichert
Akkerman will be there. They hope to have several conferences plus coding
parties where real work can be done. They are looking for speakers and also
for sponsors. Also it's been proposed that this not be a one-time affair,
but instead be an anual event that moves to a new country each year.
</p>

<p>
Helix Code has <a href="http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/958714217/">
released</a> Debian packages of Helix Gnome. It sounds like they went all
out to make these well behaved Debian packages: "<i>We really want to do
this right.  In  particular, we want all of our packages to be lintian
clean.  If you find a policy violation in a Helix GNOME package, it's a bug.
</i>"
