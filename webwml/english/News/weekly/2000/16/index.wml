<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
It seems likely that we will have a second test cycle. Adam Di Carlo wrote
(oa66sfz6pf.fsf@arroz.fake) that "<i>We need a release kernel, not a a
pre-release kernel.  We need to fix some rather nasty problems in
boot-floppies</i>". CD images still don't exist for this test cycle --
there has been a communication SNAFU (20000515135352.H22524@xs4all.nl) that
delayed them. Because of these and other problems, Richard Braakman is 
thinking about restarting the current test cycle
(20000515202239.A23800@xs4all.nl).

<p>
Here's an update (20000515155754.A543@polynum.com) on plans for the First
Debian Conference in France, which is being held as part of the Libre
Software Meeting. RMS will be there to talk about the HURD, and Wichert
Akkerman will be there (***** don't post that w/o confirm from Wichert
****). They hope to have several conferences plus coding parties where real
work can be done. They are looking for speakers and also for sponsors. Also
it's been proposed that this not be a one-time affair, but instead be an
anual event that moves to a new country each year.
