<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>No Debian Weekly News was published last week because there was little to
report on</b>, except
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg00830.html">
indecision</a> about what to do about the first test cycle. The test cycle
started slowly, and <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/potato_pre.html">CD
images</a> were not available until this Monday. We have learned something
from this test cycle though -- as Richard Braakman said, "<i>The first test 
cycle flushed out some coordination problems</i>" and
"<i>We hope that the next cycle will be a more thorough test of the
distribution itself.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>And in the meantime, it has become clear that we do another test cycle</b>.
Boot-floopies team leader Adam Di Carlo 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-boot-0005/msg00309.html">wrote</a>
that "<i>We need a release kernel, not a a pre-release kernel.  We need to fix
some rather nasty problems in boot-floppies</i>". And so Richard Braakman plans
to end the current test cycle on the 24th, and start another one on the 29th.
In preparation for that, he plans to "<i>remove most of the packages that have
release-critical bugs from potato</i>" on the 25th and 26th. Read
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0005/msg00009.html">
his message</a> for other important details.

<p>
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0005/msg00006.html">
Here's an update</a> on <b>plans for the First Debian Conference in France</b>,
which is being held as part of the Libre Software Meeting. RMS will be there to
talk about the HURD, and Wichert Akkerman will be there. The organizers hope
to have several conferences plus coding parties where real work can be done.
They are looking for speakers and also for sponsors. Also it's been proposed
that this not be a one-time affair, but instead be an anual event that moves
to a new country each year. If you are a developer who is interested in the
conference, please fill out
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg01366.html">this
short survey</a> to let the organizers know what to expect.
</p>

<p>
Helix Code has <a href="http://news.gnome.org/gnome-news/958714217/">
released</a> <b>Debian packages of Helix Gnome<b>. It sounds like they went all
out to make these well behaved Debian packages: "<i>We really want to do
this right.  In  particular, we want all of our packages to be lintian
clean.  If you find a policy violation in a Helix GNOME package, it's a bug.
</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>Should packages that depend on packages in non-US/main be put in main,
contrib, or non-US/main?</b> Before non-US was split, the answer was
"contrib". Now, though, what should be done is less clear. The most
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg01281.html">popular
choice</a> seems to be non-US/main, with various arguments being made for
each of the choices.
</p>

<p>
<b>In server news</b>, ftp.debian.org has been
<a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2000/20000521">upgraded and moved</a> so
it is connected directly to an international network backbone. When potato is
finally released, we'll be ready ...
