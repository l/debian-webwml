<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

Potato update: In the aftermath of the release, everything is mostly going
well. It did take a while to get CD images mirrored to enough sites to meet
demand. Also, the SPARC and alpha CDs released with potato were not bootable,
and there were some other minor problems with the images, due to both a
lack of testing of the final CD images, and hardware problems on the build
machine. (20000817063104.D19580@visi.net) (87em3jbugl.fsf@sheikh.hands.com)
Ftp.debian.org has been running at full capacity since release (**** make
sure it is mostly full before publishing this ****) -- if you have not yet
upgraded, remember to use a <a href="../../../../distrib/ftplist">mirror</a>.

Articles about Debian 2.2 in the press. Linux Weekly News wrote up an 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2000/features/LinuxWorld/Debian.php3">article on the
press conference</a>. LinuxPlanet posted a comprehensive 
and generally favorible 
<a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/2204/1/">review of
Debian 2.2</a> that's full of good quotes, like "<i>The project moves forward
at a seemingly ponderous pace, but a little time spent reading through the 
myriad developer and user lists reveals a disarmingly feverish quest for
perfection</i>" and "<i>installation has improved in some key areas since
the Slink release of over a year ago, noticably lowering the bar to
entry.</i>

Security: The version of xlockmore shipped with Debian 2.2 (slink) is
vulnerable to a local exploit of the shadow group. In general, the versions
in Debian 2.2 and unstable are not, but fixed packages have been provided
for all three versions, just in case. (O8GPx.A.r5D.1q2m5@murphy)
New netscape packages were uploaded to non-free
(E13Qgjq-0008HE-00@va.debian.org), fixing a variety of security holes.

"Re: Intent To Split: netbase" stuff about traceroute, /sbin, and paths in
general. (87itt2bc18.fsf@glaurung.green-gryphon.com) is good.

How would you like to have an up-to-date distribution like unstable,
without the associated set of nasty new bugs every day? Anthony Towns has
been working to make this a reality with his "testing" distribution, and
now he's ready to roll it out into Debian proper. According to AJ,
"the point of the 'testing' distribution: to contain a consistent set of 
the most recent 'believed-to-be-reliable' packages". "The point of packages
in testing is not that they should be perfect or bug-free, just that they
should be usable." This is accomplished by making testing lag behind
unstable by a couple of weeks, watching what bugs are opened against new
versions of packages in unstable, and allowing updagted packages that do
not introduce bad bugs to filter into testing. The result is that three
distributions would always be available:
<ul>
<li><i>unstable</i> bleeding edge, broken, etc
<li><i>testing</i> leading edge, maybe buggy, but working
<li><i>stable</i> static, usable, going out of date
</ul>
AJ thinks that this will also speed up the release process -- we can freeze
testing, and start preparing for a release with a distribution that is
already mostly bug-free. He concludes that
"it's coded. It works. It serves a useful purpose. I think we should
use it."
