<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Release update:</b> In the aftermath of the release, everything is mostly
going well. Ftp.debian.org has been running at full capacity since release
-- if you have not yet upgraded, remember to use a
<a href="../../../../distrib/ftplist">mirror</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>There were some problems with the CD images for 2.2.</b>
It took a while to get CD images mirrored to enough sites to meet demand.
Then it <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0008/msg00158.html">was
discovered</a> that the SPARC and alpha CDs released with potato were not 
bootable, and there were some
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0008/msg00216.html">other minor
problems</a> with other images. These problems are due to both insufficient 
testing of the final CD images, and hardware problems with the CD image 
build machine. <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/lastmin.html">Fixed images</a>
are labelled as version 2.2rev0a.
</p>

<p>
<b>Several articles have already appeared about Debian 2.2.</b> Linux Weekly
News wrote up an <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/features/LinuxWorld/Debian.php3">
article about the press conference</a>. LinuxPlanet posted a comprehensive 
and generally favourable
<a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/2204/1/">review of
Debian 2.2</a> that's full of good quotes, like "<i>The project moves forward
at a seemingly ponderous pace, but a little time spent reading through the 
myriad developer and user lists reveals a disarmingly feverish quest for
perfection</i>" and "<i>installation has improved in some key areas since
the Slink release of over a year ago, noticeably lowering the bar to
entry.</i> And ITworld 
<a href="http://www.idg.net/ic_221264_1794_9-10000.html">ran a story</a> on
Debian. "<i>Much attention has been paid to the commercialisation of Linux,
but the spirit of open source that drives Linux may be best seen in efforts 
like the Debian development group, which is something of a labor of love for
the programmers involved.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes:</b> The version of xlockmore shipped with Debian 2.1 (slink) is
vulnerable to a local exploit of the shadow group. In general, the versions
in Debian 2.2 and unstable are not, but
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00028.html">
fixed packages</a> have been provided for all three versions, just in case.
An <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00029.html">
updated fix</a> for a security hole in Zope was released -- the original fix
"<i>did not fully address the issue</i>".
</p>

<p>
<b>With the release out of the way</b>, everyone was glad to get back to the
important things, like inconclusive flamewars over obscure points of the
FHS. This was mostly a rehashing of an <a href="../../1999/48/#traceroute">old
controversy</a> about whether traceroute belongs in <tt>/usr/sbin</tt> or
<tt>/usr/bin</tt> Some 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00758.html">good
points</a> were made, but we continue to be as divided as ever on this issue.
</p>

<p>
<b>A more interesting discussion concerned meta-packages.</b> It would be nice
to generalize the several methods we have of grouping packages now -- by
priority, by section, in task packages -- and come up with 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00721.html">one
mechanism</a> that can handle all three.
</p>

<p>
<a name="testing"></a>
<b>How would you like to have an up-to-date distribution like unstable,
without the associated set of nasty new bugs every day?</b> Anthony Towns has
been working to make this a reality with his "testing" distribution, and
now he's <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00906.html">
ready to roll it out</a> into Debian proper. According to AJ,
"<i>the point of the 'testing' distribution: to contain a consistent set of 
the most recent 'believed-to-be-reliable' packages</i>". "<i>The point of
packages in testing is not that they should be perfect or bug-free, just
that they should be usable.</i>" This is accomplished by making testing lag
behind unstable by a couple of weeks, watching what bugs are opened against
new versions of packages in unstable, and allowing updated packages that do
not introduce bad bugs to filter into testing. The result is that three
distributions would always be available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><i>unstable</i> bleeding edge, broken, etc
<li><i>testing</i> leading edge, maybe buggy, but working
<li><i>stable</i> static, usable, going out of date
</ul>
<p>
AJ thinks that this will also speed up the release process -- we can freeze
testing rather than freezing unstable, and start preparing for a release with
a distribution that is already mostly bug-free. He concludes that
"<i>it's coded. It works. It serves a useful purpose. I think we should
use it.</i>"
