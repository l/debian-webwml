Potato update: In the aftermath of the release, everything is mostly going
well. It did take a while to get CD images mirrored to enough sites to meet
demand. Also, the SPARC CD released with potato was not bootable, due to a
lack of testing of the final CD images. (20000817063104.D19580@visi.net)

How would you like to have an up-to-date distribution like unstable,
without the associated set of nasty new bugs every day? Anthony Towns has
been working to make this a reality with his "testing" distribution, and
now he's ready to roll it out into Debian proper. According to AJ,
"the point of the 'testing' distribution: to contain a consistent set of 
the most recent 'believed-to-be-reliable' packages". "The point of packages
in testing is not that they should be perfect or bug-free, just that they
should be usable." This is accomplished by making testing lag behind
unstable by a couple of weeks, watching what bugs are opened against new
versions of packages in unstable, and allowing updagted packages that do
not introduce bad bugs to filter into testing. The result is that three
distributions would always be available:
<ul>
<li><i>unstable</i> bleeding edge, broken, etc
<li><i>testing</i> leading edge, maybe buggy, but working
<li><i>stable</i> static, usable, going out of date
</ul>
AJ thinks that this will also speed up the release process -- we can freeze
testing, and start preparing for a release with a distribution that is
already mostly bug-free. He concludes that
"it's coded. It works. It serves a useful purpose. I think we should
use it."
