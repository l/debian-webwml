Subject: Re: O: penguineyes(-gnome) -- a GTK+/GNOME version of Xeyes

First, my apologies to all the people reading -qa for the confusion
caused.  I didn't realize -qa would get sooooooo spammed.

What happened? (Or, what the heck is going on?!?!)

Yesterday Joy mentioned on IIRC that the BTS needed to be fed with the
current information from the WNPP system in order to get the BTS&lt;-&gt;WNPP
proposal going on.  I did that.  What I did was just to follow the WNPP
docs, the BTS docs and the agreement on -devel, plus the proposal from
Lars regarding the severities and titles of the bugs.  As much
information from the current WNPP was fed into the BTS, and the people
who submitted that information got CCed.  In the case of packages marked
with 'W' (moved to project/orphaned), the address used was, as you might
have guessed now, 'debian-qa@lists.debian.org'.

 &gt; &gt; The current maintainer of this package has orphaned it, but the package
 &gt; &gt; itself is still on the distribution.  If you are interested on the package
 &gt; &gt; please send a short note to /this/ bug (nnnnn@bugs.debian.org) stating so.
 &gt; &gt; Once you have fully adopted the package and you are listed as its
 &gt; &gt; maintainer, please close this bug.
 &gt; 
 &gt; Hm, how did you gather the data which packages are orphaned and which
 &gt; are not? penguineyes is not orphaned anymore as it has been taken over
 &gt; by Adrian Bunk &lt;bunk@fs.tum.de&gt;. 

This is what the current WNPP knows.  If the information is wrong,
in particular, if the package has been adopted, please send an email to
nnnnn-done@bugs.debian.org stating that.

Thanks,


                                    Marcelo
