Subject: New libc6 breaks exim?


  Just a heads-up -- I upgraded to the new libc6 version, and exim started
refusing to accept SMTP connections from fetchmail. [1] I'm not sure what the
issue is exactly, but when running /usr/sbin/sendmail manually some non-fatal
errors are displayed about libdb2.so.  (if I manage to track it down more I'll
file a bug report--right now I don't even know whether it's a problem with
exim or with libc6)

  So if you use exim, you might want to at least dpkg-repack your old libc
before upgrading, or demonstrate that I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)..

  [1] Thank God for procmail, which lets me at least sort of get my email..

Sendmail appears to have a similar problem.  Mail sent by a user gets
sent out, but some of the messages to root appear to get stuck in a
queue:

e8QM2C130758     1912 Tue Sep 26 15:02 root
                 (Deferred: user database error)
                                       root

newaliases won't run, either.

I tried rebuilding sendmail but get a bunch of errors I haven't been
able to sort out yet.  I filed bug #72519 against sendmail, but don't
really have a handle on the problem.
