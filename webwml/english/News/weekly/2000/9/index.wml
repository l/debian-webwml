<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
<b>Debian GNU/Linux For Dummies</b> is due in May, according to
<a href="http://www.buy.com/books/product.asp?sku=30576349">this web page</a>.
With <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/books">7 Debian books</a> already
in print, in 3 languages, it's clear we've reached the point where another
Debian book is no big deal. It's more iteresting to consider how a
"Dummies" book with Debian on the cover may change our userbase..
