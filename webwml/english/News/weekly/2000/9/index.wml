<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian GNU/Linux For Dummies</b> is due in May, according to
<a href="http://www.buy.com/books/product.asp?sku=30576349">this web page</a>.
With <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/books">7 Debian books</a> already
in print, in 3 languages, it's clear we've reached the point where another
Debian book is no big deal. It's more iteresting to consider how a
"Dummies" book with Debian on the cover may change our userbase..

<p>
Deja vu: Major new releases of X (20000312131654.A12542@ecn.purdue.edu), the
kernel, and apache are out or looming on the horizon, and Debian is in the
middle of a freeze. What to do? Mainly discuss the same issues
(20000311161550.A3331@debian.org) we did last time, it seems.
