<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Another Bug Horizon has been set</b> for March 27th.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00015.html">
115 packages</a> are in danger of being removed and once again some very
important packages are among them. Richard Braakman also 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00014.html">
mentioned</a> that he hopes to start the first test cycle "<i>right after that
date</i>", and only important bugfixes are now allowed into frozen. Debian 2.1
has been out for a year as of this week.
</p>

<p>
<b>The new-maintainer process is beginning to reopen.</b> Dale Scheetz 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00013.html">
posted a call</a> for sponsors of prospective new maintainers to submit them
to the application process. This will be used to test the identification
process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Deja vu:</b> Important new releases of 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg00534.html">X</a>,
the kernel, and apache are out or looming on the horizon, and Debian is in the
middle of a freeze. What to do? Mainly 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg00495.html">discuss
the same issues</a> we did last time: package pools, changing release
frequency, updates to stable, etc.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian GNU/Linux For Dummies</b> is due in May, according to
<a href="http://www.us.buy.com/retail/department.asp?loc=106">this web page</a>.
With <a href="$(DOC)/books">7 Debian books</a> already
in print, in 3 languages, it's clear we've reached the point where another
Debian book is no big deal. It's more interesting to consider how a
"Dummies" book with Debian on the cover may change our userbase..
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian Project Leader elections</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00011.html">
close on the 16th</a>. Note that DWN incorrectly reported they would close
last week; the date on the ballots was wrong. If you <em>still</em> haven't
voted, a few days remain.
</p>

<p>
A security fix for mtr is
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20000309">available</a>.
</p>

<p>
