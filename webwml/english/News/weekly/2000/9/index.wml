<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Another Bug Horizon has been set</b> for March 27th. In the same mail
(20000313102154.A4652@xs4all.nl), Richard Braakman mentioned that he hopes
to start the first test cycle "<i>right after that date</i>", and only
important bugfixes are now allowed into frozen. 115 packages
(20000313111455.A9205@xs4all.nl) are in danger of being removed and once again
some very important packages are amoung them.
</p>

<p>
Deja vu: Major new releases of X (20000312131654.A12542@ecn.purdue.edu),
the kernel, and apache are out or looming on the horizon, and Debian is in the
middle of a freeze. What to do? Mainly discuss the same issues
(20000311161550.A3331@debian.org) we did last time, it seems.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian GNU/Linux For Dummies</b> is due in May, according to
<a href="http://www.buy.com/books/product.asp?sku=30576349">this web page</a>.
With <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/books">7 Debian books</a> already
in print, in 3 languages, it's clear we've reached the point where another
Debian book is no big deal. It's more iteresting to consider how a
"Dummies" book with Debian on the cover may change our userbase..
</p>

<p>
Debian Project Leader elections close on the 16th
(20000309153105.11600.qmail@master.debian.org). Note that DWN
incorrectly reported they would close last week; the date on the ballots
was wrong. If you <em>still</em> haven't voted, a few days remain.
