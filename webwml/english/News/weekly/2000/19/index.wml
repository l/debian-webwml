<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Release news:</b>
Richard Braakman will be gone for a week or two, and unable to serve as
release manager. In the meantime, Anthony Towns will be
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00006.html">
stepping in</a> as Acting Release Manager. Anthony has already 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00007.html">
posted plans</a> to end the current test cycle in the middle of this week, 
and has <a href="mail#1">listed the changes</a> he plans to accept
into potato before the next test cycle.
</p>

<p><b>There are two security fixes this week.</b> A 
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20000619">fix is available</a> for a bug
in xinetd's access control mechanism, and a remote exploit of zope has also been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg01541.html">
fixed</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Looking ahead to woody</b>, Joey Hess is 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0006/msg00279.html">stepping
up</a> as the new leader of the woody boot-floppies team. The goal is to
redesign the installation system and replace it with something more modular,
flexible, smaller, and easier to use. Debian Weekly News wishes the
boot-floppies team (and its upcoming leader ;-) luck on this ambitious
endeavor. <!-- grin, duck, and run -->
</p>

<p>
<b>Another item removed from dpkg's wishlist:</b> For years, we have run into
occasional problems where the simplest solution was "use versioned provides".
Unfortunately, the <tt>Provides:</tt> field in Debian packages has never
supported versioning.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00025.html">It
does now.</a> However, Jason Gunthorpe 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00029.html">points
out</a> that using versioned provides in woody will probably lead to all sorts
of upgrade trouble.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian's voting system</b>, as established in the 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">Debian Constitution</a>,
employs an interesting voting method called Concorde voting. Since Debian
is one of the few real-world organizations to make use of this type of vote
counting, we've attracted the interest of members of the 
<a href="http://www.eskimo.com/~robla/em/">Election Methods mailing list</a>.
This week, Norman Petry, a member of the Election Methods list, 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0006/msg00095.html">posted</a>
about a "<i>circular tie</i>" situation where no one wins a vote, and the
constitution does not specify what should be done, leading to an undefined
outcome. He has calculated that "<i>you can expect to encounter a circular tie
about once every 20 elections or so, on average</i>". He suggests that we
proactively modify the constitution to fix the problem before it occurs.
</p>

<p>
Followups to last week's news:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The discussion about dropping non-free from Debian has died down. The
issue is not resolved though, and will come to vote soon.
<li>Last week's offer of $3k to KDE If they could fix their license has led to
more Debian/KDE articles, including a
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/06/17/961300740.html">Freshmeat
Editorial</a> by Joseph Carter. It appears that Dr. Bechly has
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/13/1642213&amp;mode=nested">
withdrawn the offer</a>, after KDE declined to send him an official
response. He has retargeted the money to Debian, in hopes of improving
Debian's installer.
</ul>
