<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
Richard Braakman will be gone for a week or two, and unable to serve as
release manager. Anthony Towns will be stepping in as Acting Release
Manager in the meantime. (20000617234324.A14334@xs4all.nl) Anthony promptly
posted plans to end the current test cycle in the middle of this week, and
a list of changes to make to potato before the next test cycle.

Looking ahead to woody, Joey Hess is stepping up as the new leader of the
woody boot-floppies team. (20000617201354.F1605@kitenet.net) The goal is to
redesign the installation system and replace it with something better.

<p>
Last week's offer of $3k to KDE If they could fix their license has led to
more Debian/KDE articles this week, including a
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/06/17/961300740.html">Freshmeat
Editorial</a> by Joseph Carter. It appears that Dr. Bechly has
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/13/1642213&mode=nested">
withdrawn the offer</a>, after KDE declined to send him an official
response. He has retargeted the money to Debian, in hopes of improving
Debian's installer.
