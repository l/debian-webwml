<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Richard Braakman will be gone for a week or two, and unable to serve as
release manager. Anthony Towns will be stepping in as Acting Release
Manager in the meantime. (20000617234324.A14334@xs4all.nl) Anthony promptly
posted plans to end the current test cycle in the middle of this week, and
a list of changes to make to potato before the next test cycle.

Looking ahead to woody, Joey Hess is stepping up as the new leader of the
woody boot-floppies team. (20000617201354.F1605@kitenet.net) The goal is to
redesign the installation system and replace it with something more modular,
flexable, smaller, and easier to use. Debian Weekly News wishes the
boot-floppies team (and its upcoming leader ;-) luck on this ambitious
endeavor. <!-- grin, duck, and run -->
</p>

<p>
Another item removed from dpkg's wishlist: For years, we have run into
occasional problems where the simplest solution was "use versioned provides".
Unfortunatly, the <tt>Provides:</tt> field in Debian packages has never
supported versioning.
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00025.html">It
does now.</a>
</p>

<p>
A discussion is underway about ways to eliminate the need for -source.deb 
packages that contain source for the kernel, kernel modules, and so on,
and using apt-get source instead. The details are not resolved yet.

Followups to last week's news:
<ul>
<li>The discussion about dropping non-free from Debian has died down. The
issue is not resolved though, and will presumably come to a vote soon.
<li>Last week's offer of $3k to KDE If they could fix their license has led to
more Debian/KDE articles this week, including a
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/06/17/961300740.html">Freshmeat
Editorial</a> by Joseph Carter. It appears that Dr. Bechly has
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/13/1642213&mode=nested">
withdrawn the offer</a>, after KDE declined to send him an official
response. He has retargeted the money to Debian, in hopes of improving
Debian's installer.
