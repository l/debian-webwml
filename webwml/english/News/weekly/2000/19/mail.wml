Subject: Test Cycle Three status

(again, bcc'ed to -devel-announce; and again, be careful with followups,
-release isn't a general discussion list)

Hello world,

I should be finalising all the packages for test cycle three later today
(ie, in around eighteen hours). The current state is:

	* Install updates for:
	    amanda anacron atlas autofs base-config cricket cupsys
	    dhttpd dpkg emacs20 epic eterm glide2-v2 glide2-v3
	    gnats gnomba gnome-pim kon2 locale-ja login.app mailx mul2
	    nvi-m17n openldapd openssh opie pam pcmcia-cs pdl plplot
	    postgresql quota qvwm roxen rxvt setserial splitvt sslwrap
	    sysvinit whois xemacs21 xfree86 xinetd xlockmore zope

	* Remove:
	    cheops, gnome-napster, tgif, freeamp(from powerpc only)

Boot-floppies and CD scripts seem to be basically ready and waiting for
the packages to be updated, with no major changes from this current test
cycle which bodes well.

Packages which will hopefully be uploaded shortly (and will then be
installed) are:

	emacsen-common (existing is okay if not updated)
	kernel-image-* (existing is okay if not updated)
	cce (will be removed if not updated)
	typespeed (will be removed if not updated)

The maintainers of all these packages have been contacted already and
should have a reasonable grasp of what's going on.

The remaining foreseeable things which could hold up TC3 seem to be limited
to arches taking overly long to rebuild the various updated packages.


Okay, so that means if there are any packages at all that absolutely have
to be removed (or updated, if they have updates ready) from potato that
aren't listed above, then you need to mail me ASAP with details. Known
bugs that aren't fixed with the above basically won't be for potato. Also,
if there's anything else not mentioned above that needs to be taken care
of for test cycle three, please email me. The more we get fixed right now,
the more likely that this will turn out to be suitable for release.

Cheers,
aj (acting release manager)

I don't speak for anyone save myself. GPG signed mail preferred.
