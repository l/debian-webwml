<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the Test Cycle, little has been happening in Debian this week,
which makes this a good time for some sysadminly activities on the
Debian servers:
<ul>
<li>The main Debian archive has moved (87zoq5ep5g.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans)
from master.debian.org to auric.debian.org (aka ftp-master.debian.org). Auric
is our  <a href="../../../../News/2000/20000317">new UltraSPARC</a>. This
move has been planned for some time, but it was triggered by a disk crash on
master. This will reduce the load on master and increase the speed of the
daily archive updates. The move is still in progress.
<li>Jason Gunthorpe posted
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1000508232403.16522M-100000@wakko.deltatee.com) about
<b>changes to master.debian.org's mail server</b>. At last
master is using a free mail server, instead of qmail. Jason reports that he
has "<i>painstakingly converted all the .qmail files into comparable .forward
files where possible, and mailed people otherwise</i>". LDAP is now used to
automatically route <tt>@debian.org</tt> mail to the correct destination.
</p>

<p>
Although the first Test Cycle is a week old now, we don't yet have final
CD images for it. The boot floppies are ready though. Release-related posts
this week included a look at archive consistency
(20000505172312.A4175@azure.humbug.org.au)
and discussion (Pine.LNX.3.96.1000506012159.19487A-100000@panic.et.tudelft.nl)
about release notes and upgrade procedures from versions of Debian as old as
1.1.

<p>
The new maintainer team now has a
<a href="http://pandora.debian.org/~csmall/nmtest/login.php">web site</a> with
a database of prospective new maintainers that keeps track of how far along
in the process each person is. 61 people are in the queue. Dale Scheetz
<a href="http://cipsa.physik.uni-freiburg.de/pipermail/nm-discuss/2000-May/000378.html">
mentioned</a> that he is going to start working through the backlog of people
who applied to become maintainers since last October.
</p>

<p>
The Debian S/390 port seems to be getting off to a good start.
