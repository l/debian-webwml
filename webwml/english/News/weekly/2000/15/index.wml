<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
Thanks to the Test Cycle, little has been happening in Debian this week,
which makes this a good time for some sysadminly activities on the
Debian servers:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The main Debian archive
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg00342.html">has
moved</a></b> from master.debian.org to auric.debian.org
(aka ftp-master.debian.org). Auric is our
<a href="../../../../News/2000/20000317">new UltraSPARC</a>. This move has
been planned for some time, but it was triggered by a disk crash on master.
This will reduce the load on master and increase the speed of the daily
archive updates.
<li>Jason Gunthorpe <a href="mail#mail1">explained</a>
<b>changes to master.debian.org's mail server</b>. At last
master is using a free mail server, instead of qmail. Jason reports that he
has "<i>painstakingly converted all the .qmail files into comparable .forward
files where possible, and mailed people otherwise</i>". LDAP is now used to
automatically route <tt>@debian.org</tt> mail to the correct destination.
</ul>

<p>
<b>The first Test Cycle</b> is a week old now, but final CD images for it
have not been announced. The boot floppies are
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0005/msg00023.html">ready</a>
though. Release-related posts this week included a look at
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg00352.html">archive
consistency</a>
and <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0005/msg00018.html">discussion
</a> about release notes and upgrade procedures from versions of Debian as
old as 1.1.
</p>

<p>
<b>The new maintainer team</b> now has a
<a href="https://nm.debian.org/">web site</a> with
a database of prospective new maintainers that keeps track of how far along
in the process each person is. 66 people are moving through the queue. Dale
Scheetz
<a href="http://cipsa.physik.uni-freiburg.de/pipermail/nm-discuss/2000-May/000378.html">
mentioned</a> that he is going to start working through the backlog of people
who applied to become maintainers since last October.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Debian S/390 port</b> seems to be getting off to a <a href="mail#mail2">good
start</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> in Debian this week include the following and 29 more:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/bwap">bwap</a>: Napster
