<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
Jason Gunthorpe <a href="http://master.debian.org/~jgg/mail-change.txt">
posted</a> about <b>mail changes in progess on master.debian.org</b>. LDAP
will now be used to route <tt>@debian.org</tt> mail to the correct
destination. This is in preparation for removing the non-free qmail from
master and replacing it with a free MTA, a long-awaited transition. Jason
requested that no one change their .forward or .qmail files on master in
the meantime.
