<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Over 100 packages are in danger of being removed from Debian.</b>
Richard Braakman <a href="mail#2">posted</a> a list of packages that are
headed for the Release Critical Bug Horizon and are due to be removed less
than a week from now if their bugs remain unfixed. Threatened package include
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/apache">apache</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/fetchmail">fetchmail</a>, 
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/gpm">gpm</a>, and
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/samba">samba</a>. Already this has led to a
significant decrease in the size of the
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">Release Critical bug
list</a> as people work to get bugs fixed on time. Perhaps the best example
of this work is this <a href="http://tv.debian.net/linux/debian/ssh-bugs.html">
project</a> to fix all of openssh's bugs. However, the 28th still bodes 
to be a very interesting and eventful day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Elections for the next Debian Project Leader have opened</b>, and will 
close in two weeks. Developers can grab a <a href="mail#3">ballot</a> and
vote. Linux.com is posting interviews with the candidates, starting with an
interview of <a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000223/40/">Ben
Collins</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Dale Scheetz posted a <a href="mail#1">summary</a> of what the New Maintainer
team is doing:</b> work is progressing on the web site, backend database, and
Applicant's FAQ. The team is mostly done with writing an Applicant's
Checklist. Soon, they plan to "<i>run a "test case" through the process to
shake out any issues</i>", and then begin on the backlog of people who have 
waited so long for new-maintainer to reopen. This should all happen within the
next few weeks.
</p>

<p>
<b>Will Debian Alpha be fit for release with the rest of potato?</b> David
Huggins-Daines raised a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-0002/msg00176.html">
number of concerns</a> -- many packages cannot be built on alpha right now,
C++ programs have major problems, Debian Alpha is not binary-compatabile with
Red Hat, and "<i>in short, our  system is in a mess due to circumstances
entirely beyond our control</i>". David proposed that we revert to an older
version of egcs for Alpha, as it seems gcc is at the root of all these
problems.
</p>

<p>

</p>
