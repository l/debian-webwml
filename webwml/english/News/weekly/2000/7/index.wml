<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Will Debian Alpha be fit for release with the rest of potato? David
Huggins-Daines raised a number of concerns
(87emaaeza4.fsf@blood-axp.eradicator.org) -- many packages
cannot be built on alpha right now, C++ programs have major problems,
Debian Alpha is not binary-compatabile with Red Hat, and "<i>in short, our 
system is in a mess due to circumstances entirely beyond our control</i>".
David proposed that we revert to an older version of egcs for Alpha, as it
seems gcc is at the root of all these problems.
</p>

<p>
A total of 155 packages are in danger of being removed from Debian.
Richard Braakman
<a href="Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0002/msg00015.html">posted</a>
a list of packages that are headed for the RC bug horizon and are due to be
removed less than a week from now if their bugs remain unfixed.
</p>

<p>
Dale Scheetz posted a <a href="mail#1">summary</a> of what the New Maintainer
team is doing: work is progressing on the web site, backend database, and
Applicant's FAQ. The team is about half way through writing an Applicant's
Checklist, and hope to finish it by the end of the week. Then they plan to
"<i>run a "test case" through the process to shake out any issues</i>", and
then begin on the backlog of people who have waited so long for new-maintainer
to reopen. This should all happen within a timeframe of the next few weeks.
