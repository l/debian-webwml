<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
Will Debian Alpha be fit for release with the rest of potato? David
Huggins-Daines raised a number of concerns
(87emaaeza4.fsf@blood-axp.eradicator.org) -- many packages including the C
library cannot be built on alpha right now, Debian Alpha is not
binary-compatabile with Red Hat, and "<i>in short, our system is in a mess
due to circumstances entirely beyond our control</i>". David proposed that
we revert to an older version of egcs for Alpha, as it seems gcc is at the
root of all these problems.
