<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
Everyone's sick of Y2K by now, but a final wrap-up is in order. Debian
survived the rollover with no major problems. Several more Y2K-related bugs
were found in packages including
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53805">ntpdate</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53817">sendfile</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53820">webalizer</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53821">birthday</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53846">cbb</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53831">pilot-manager</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53811">slrn</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53865">xinetd</a>, and
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53938">hyperlatex</a>. These bugs are
rapidly being fixed, and tend to be quite minor.

<p>
Anyone who recently installed a fresh Debian system using the potato boot
floppies has a severly broken system that is open to numerous exploits due
to permissions problems. The boot-floppies team has fixed the problem, and
it's likely very few people are affected, since few people have tried the
potato boot floppies yet. (20000101125519.A4445@xmission.com)
