<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
Everyone's sick of Y2K by now, but a final wrap-up is in order. <b>Debian
survived with no major problems.</b> Several more Y2K-related bugs were found
in packages including
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53805">ntpdate</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53817">sendfile</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53820">webalizer</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53821">birthday</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53846">cbb</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53831">pilot-manager</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53811">slrn</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53865">xinetd</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/54029">http-analyze</a>, and
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53938">hyperlatex</a>. These bugs are
rapidly being fixed, and tend to be quite minor.

<p>
The closed new-maintainer queue has moved back into people's minds this
week, with several threads starting on the subject, like this one
(20000103005507.B11213@mail.natetech.com) started by
a Debian contributor who has been forced to work through a sponsor. "<i>the
Debian Castle has been built and now all the builders are holed up inside
with everyone else standing at the moat with the drawbridge up. Some brave
folks put ladders up and scaled the walls [...] to get in and help continue
the ongoing construction inside the Castle. Many of the inhabitants of the
Castle are showing signs of denial, others are 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-project-9912/msg00052.html">blaming
the King</a>, and still others are smuggling people in over the wall as fast
as they can.</i>" Several people mentioned that new-maintainer might be
reopened this month (after the freeze, presumably), nothing athoratiative has
been seen on that subject.
</p>

<p>
While adding new maintainers to Debian continues to be an unresolved issue,
we are making progress towards finding inactive developers. In the past we
have used developer "pings", but now Jason Gunthorpe has implemented a new
method of tracking developer activity. He calls it "Echelon" and it monitors
all Debian list traffic and keeps track of the last time a developer has
been heard from. In 6 months or so we can start using this information to
contact and deal with inactive maintainers and make sure that every package
has an active person responsible for it.

<p>
<b>Anyone who recently installed a fresh Debian system using the potato boot
floppies has a severly broken system that is open to numerous exploits</b> due
to permissions problems. The boot-floppies team has fixed the problem, and
it's likely very few people are affected, since few people have tried the
potato boot floppies yet. (20000101125519.A4445@xmission.com) Work on the
boot floppies continues, on many fronts.
</p>

<p>
Should TeX and Emacs be removed from standard and put in optional?
(19991231000302.A29467@frantica.lly.org) They are the largest packages
present in the standard install, and they are singlehandedly responsible for
doubling the dize of a standard Debian install. Robert Woodcock brought the
issue up, arguing that these packages are not widely enough used to justify
putting them in standard. Predictably, opinions on this vary. One of the
more interesting messages (20000101200443.D269@ulysses.dhis.org) steps back
and looks at our whole section and priority system -- and finds it badly
lacking.

** might add something below about no new packages being in effect, if it
is. **
