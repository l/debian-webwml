<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
Anyone who recently installed a fresh Debian system using the potato boot
floppies has a severly broken system that is open to numerous exploits due
to permissions problems. The boot-floppies team has fixed the problem, and
it's likely very few people are affected, since few people have tried the
potato boot floppies yet. (20000101125519.A4445@xmission.com)
