<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Everyone's probably sick of Y2K by now, but a final wrap-up is in order.
<b>Debian survived with no major problems.</b> Several more Y2K-related bugs
were found in packages including
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53805">ntpdate</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53817">sendfile</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53820">webalizer</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53821">birthday</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53846">cbb</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53831">pilot-manager</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53811">slrn</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53865">xinetd</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/54029">http-analyze</a>, and
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/53938">hyperlatex</a>. These bugs are
rapidly being fixed, and tend to be minor.
</p>

<p>
<b>The closed new-maintainer queue has moved back into people's minds this
week</b>, with several threads starting on the subject, like <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0001/msg00090.html">this one</a>
started by a Debian contributor who has been forced to work through a sponsor.
"<i>the Debian Castle has been built and now all the builders are holed up
inside with everyone else standing at the moat with the drawbridge up. Some
brave folks put ladders up and scaled the walls </i>[...]<i> to get in and help
continue the ongoing construction inside the Castle. Many of the inhabitants
of the Castle are showing signs of denial, others are 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9912/msg00052.html">blaming
the King</a>, and still others are smuggling people in over the wall as fast
as they can.</i>" Several people mentioned that new-maintainer might be
reopened this month (after the freeze, presumably).
</p>

<p>
<b>While adding new maintainers to Debian continues to be an unresolved issue,
we are making progress towards finding inactive developers.</b> In the past we
have used developer "pings", but now Jason Gunthorpe has 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0001/msg00007.html">implemented
a new method</a> for tracking developer activity. He calls it "Echelon" and it
monitors all Debian list traffic and keeps track of the last time a developer
has been heard from. In 6 months or so we can start using this information to
contact and deal with inactive maintainers and make sure that every package
has an active person responsible for it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Anyone who recently installed a fresh Debian system using the potato boot
floppies has a severely broken system that is open to numerous exploits</b> due
to <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0001/msg00023.html">permissions
problems</a>. The boot-floppies team has fixed the problem, and it's likely
very few people are affected, since few people have tried the potato boot
floppies yet. Work on the boot floppies continues, on many fronts.
</p>

<p>
<b>Should TeX and Emacs be removed from standard and put in optional?</b>
They are the largest packages present in the standard install, and they are
singlehandedly responsible for doubling the size of a standard Debian install.
Robert Woodcock
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg01444.html">raised
the issue</a>, arguing that these packages are not widely enough used to
justify putting them in standard. Predictably, opinions on this vary. One of
the more <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0001/msg00054.html">
interesting messages</a> steps back and looks at our whole section and priority
system -- and finds it badly lacking.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> in Debian this week include the following and 20 more.
Presumably these will be the among the last new packages added to Debian in
a while, since a pre-freeze moratorium on new packages is now in effect.
