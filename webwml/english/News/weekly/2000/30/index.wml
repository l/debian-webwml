<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01072.html">Work is
underway</a> on <b>designing a replacement for Debian's aging installer</b>.
The replacement aims to address many problems of the current installer: It
will be modular so it is easier to maintain and extend, and the user interface
will be modular as well, opening the possibility of an X based install.
Other concerns include hardware auto-detection, automated "kick-start" style
installs, and support for the Hurd. This and much more is under discussion 
in a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0009/msg00132.html">long
thread</a> on the debian-boot mailing list. The plan is to have the new
installer ready for the release of woody.
</p>

<p>
<b>An important 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01219.html">new set of 
features</a> have been checked into apt's development cvs branch.</b> 
They allow apt to "pin" packages at a particular version or Debian release,
so they will not be upgraded even if apt sees that newer versions are
available. This makes it possible to add both stable and unstable to
<tt>sources.list</tt>, configure apt to only use stable by default, and
override apt at the command line as needed to easily download packages from
unstable. Other uses include downgrading, and controlling how apt uses
third party repositories such as Helix GNOME, and other things we are only
<a href="mail#1">beginning to think of</a>.
Jason Gunthorpe adds, "<i>Sadly, I don't have a complete set of
docs for this function yet, and I'm not finished my major
source-incompatible changes to the library so this code isn't going into 
unstable for a good while yet.</i>"

<b>Security fixes for Debian 2.1 will end on September 30th.</b> The 
security team
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00041.html">
announced</a> that "<i>Debian is phasing out support for Debian 2.1</i>".
Moreover, only very important fixes will be backported to slink before the
30th, and they will only be built for the i386 and m68k platforms. They
recommend that "<i>sparc and alpha users should upgrade to Debian 2.2 
(potato) immediately</i>", and that's good advice for users of any
architecture who care about security. The security team is, however, still
open to <a href="mailto:feedback@security.debian.org">feedback</a> about
this. There were no security fixes this week.

<b>The <a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/">Kernel Cousin
Debian</a></b> is a new Debian news source that was
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/dd20000907_1.epl">first
published</a> on September 7th.
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/index.epl">Kernel Cousins</a> provide
detailed summaries of mailing list traffic in a variety of projects, now
including the debian-devel mailing list (the
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian-hurd/index.epl">Kernel Cousin Debian
Hurd</a> has summarized debian-hurd for some time now). The new Kernel Cousin
Debian goes into more detail and covers more threads than does Debian Weekly
News -- while Debian Weekly News attempts to cover more mailing lists and other
news sources, and provide a more condensed summary than does the Kernel Cousin.
We hope they both prove to be valuable resources, and welcome the new Kernel
Cousin Debian -- DWN will probably borrow some material from it in the future.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Kernel Cousin Debian</b> for
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/dd20000914_2.epl">September 14th</a>
covers several threads from the past couple of weeks including discussions
about whether debhelper should be build-essential, changing a system's
default shell, and why an old version of pine with a free license isn't in
Debian yet. They are also looking for more contributors.
</p>

<p>
<b>Graphing the Debian web of trust.</b> It's been a few years since the
Debian keyring was last graphed. Now 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg01039.html">new 
graphs</a> of the debian gpg keyring have been produced. The graph of the 
gpg keyring  has some interesting properties -- the gpg keyring revolves
around DPL Wichert Akkerman. And since each key signing happens at a real
life meeting between two developers, this is a great way to get a feel for
how often we meet in real life.
</p>

<b>Lots of KDE applications continue to be added to Debian this week</b>, including

<b>Finally, a quick editorial.</b> Though it's not directly related to Debian,
<a href="http://freshmeat.net/news/2000/09/16/969163199.html">this
Freshmeat article</a> is an interesting read. In it, a developer of the
Conectiva distribution talks about making rpm suitable for use with apt. It
seems Conectiva has modified apt to work with rpm's, but making full use of 
apt makes demands of packages that rpm's cannot easily meet. "<i>Just like
a painter who paints the floor of a room and gets  trapped in a corner,
certain features in RPM seem to have been designed to make integration with 
APT impossible</i>" The problems Conectiva is running into involve things
like rpm's handing of conffiles, the lack of interactive maintainer scripts,
and the tendency of rpm's not to restart daemons on upgrade -- issues that
are partly technical, but mainly matters of policy. This is perhaps the best
answer to the age old question, "which is better, rpm or deb?": Neither.
Policy is what really matters, and Debian has a large lead over every other
distribution in terms of having a formalized, well-developed, and
consistently applied <a href="../../../../doc/debian-policy/">package
policy</a>. Let's make sure we maintain that lead.
