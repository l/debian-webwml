<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/">Kernel Cousin
Debian</a> is a new Debian news source that was 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/dd20000907_1.epl">first
published</a> on September 7th. 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/index.epl">Kernel Cousins</a> provide
detailed summaries of mailing list traffic in a variety of projects, now
including the debian-devel mailing list (the 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian-hurd/index.epl">Kernel Cousin Debian
Hurd</a> has summarized debian-hurd for some time now). The new Kernel Cousin
Debian goes into more detail and covers more topics than does Debian Weekly News
while Debian Weekly News attempts to cover more mailing lists and other news
sources, and provide a more condensed summary than does the Kernel Cousin. We
hope they both prove to be valuable resources, and welcome the new Kernel 
Cousin Debian -- DWN will probably borrow some material from it in the
future.
