<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/">Kernel Cousin
Debian</a> is a new Debian news source that was 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/dd20000907_1.epl">first
published</a> on September 7th. 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/index.epl">Kernel Cousins</a> provide
detailed summaries of mailing list traffic in a variety of projects, now
including the debian-devel mailing list (the 
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian-hurd/index.epl">Kernel Cousin Debian
Hurd</a> has summarized debian-hurd for some time now). The new Kernel Cousin
Debian goes into more detail and covers more topics than does Debian Weekly News
while Debian Weekly News attempts to cover more mailing lists and other news
sources, and provide a more condensed summary than does the Kernel Cousin. We
hope they both prove to be valuable resources, and welcome the new Kernel 
Cousin Debian -- DWN will probably borrow some material from it in the
future.

(*** Have to mention the debian-boot megathread, "redesigning the debian
installer". My first post is 20000912141801.A23399@kitenet.net ***)

Graphing the Debian web of trust. This has been done before, a few years
back. Now <a href="http://www.chaosreigns.com/debian-keyring/">new graphs</a>
of the debian keyring have been produced, graphing our new gpg keyring.
The graph of the gpg keyring has some interesting features -- the gpg
keyring revolves around DPL Wichert Akkerman. And since each key signing
happens at a real life meeting between two developers, this is a great way
to get a feel for how often we meet in real life.

<b>Security fixes for Debian 2.1 will end on September 30th.</b> The security
team announced that "<i>Debian is phasing out support for Debian 2.1</i>".
Moreover, only very important fixes will be backported to slink before the
30th, and they will only be built for the i386 and m68k platforms. They
reccommend that "<i>sparc and alpha users should upgrade to Debian 2.2 
(potato) immediately</i>", and that's good advice for users of any
architecture who care about security. The security team is, however, still
open to <a href="mailto:feedback@security.debian.org">feedback</a> about 
this</a>. (E13Zhgc-000234-00@master.debian.org)
