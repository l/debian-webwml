<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian's non-US archive has been moved into a package pool.</b> This is
the 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00012.html">
start of the transition to package pools</a> For a quick peek at the non-US
pool, start
<a href="http://non-us.debian.org/pool/non-US/main/">here</a>. Non-US was 
moved first because it is a small archive that will let us find out what
breaks without affecting all of Debian. So far 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg01827.html">nothing
significant</a> has broken. Package pools have long been the holy grail of
Debian archive maintenance, discussed over and over for years, with many
benefits, but rather difficult to implement. It's great to finally have them.

<b>Where's Debian 2.2r2?</b> The update to stable didn't materialize this 
weekend, as we had hoped it would. There was a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0011/msg00083.html">delay</a>
in getting a new version of the boot floppies built with working PCMCIA
support. With many boot floppies developers gone over Thanksgiving, that 
didn't get done until 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0011/msg00673.html">today</a>. 
In the meantime some more security fixes have accumulated and should make
their way into 2.2r2. Both are symlink attacks, one against 
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20001123">ghostscript</a>, and the other 
in the venerable editor,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00090.html">
ed</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The bug tracking system</b> has had some 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg01934.html">new tags 
and severities</a> added to it. The biggest change is a new "serious"
severity, and some changes to the definitions of other severities. The 
"important" severity will no longer make the bug release critical; only 
"serious" and above bugs will delay a Debian release. And speaking of bug
tracking, there was a 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0011/msg00183.html">big 
discussion</a> on the policy mailing list this week about dpkg's new support
for marking the Origin of packages that were built by others than Debian, 
and the new Bugs field that can redirect bugs on those packages. Though dpkg 
and report already support these new fields, there is a lot of disagreement
over exactly how they should be used.

<p>
<b>Should every GPL'd package include the full text of the GPL?</b> Debian
currently ships exactly one copy of the GPL, and copyright files simply
refer to it. However, 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0011/msg00235.html">RMS has
stated</a> that "<i>when a single package is distributed, it has to *come
with* a copy of the GPL</i>". It can be 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0011/msg00250.html">argued</a>
that Debian does not distribute singleton packages, but rather an entire 
distribution which does include the full text of the GPL. But what about 
people who re-distribute a single Debian package? They may be technically
violating the GPL. Of course bloating Debian with several thousand copies of
the GPL should be avoided if at all possible, and Ben Collins has proposed an
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0011/msg00242.html">extension
to dpkg</a> that could allow every package to contain the GPL, but only
install one copy. This discussion is still young, so DWN will revisit it 
next week.
