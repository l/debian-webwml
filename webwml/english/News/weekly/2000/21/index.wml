<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
AJ posted an update on the status of test cycle 3, which begins Real Soon
Now. "<i>The purpose of the third test cycle is simply to ensure that we're
ready to release: we believe the previous two cycles have shaken out most of
the bugs in the install procedure, so we don't expect major problems.</i>"
Randolph Chung said in an install report of the latest boot-floppies build,
"<i>So I'd say [boot-floppies] 2.2.16 for i386 is definitely ready for
upload, and probably ready for potato release.<i>"

Paul J Thompson posted about Debian reaching "<i>critical mass</i>" of
public recognization. He cited the increasing number of 
<a href="../../../../related_links#basedon">distributions based on Debian</a>,
the many people and projects that are beginning to
release debian packages and support Debian, etc. With growth comes
problems, and Paul identified two keys problems that are nothing new:
the unweildly number of packages, and release schedule difficulties. He went
on make a "<i>radical</i>" suggestion to address the problems -- split
up Debian into several sections like core, rapid development, and so on,
that have different release schedules. It's an interesting message,
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02182.html">well
worth reading</a> even if you
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02209.html">
disagree with his ideas.

<p>
Security fixes: A remote exploit in canna has been

Other interesting things: Chuan-kai Lin has set up
(8k49on$3g1$1@www.phys.ntu.edu.tw) a 
<a href="http://oink.cc.ntu.edu.tw/~cklin/signing/index.html">web page</a>
devoted to tracking key signing requests. Fumitoshi UKAI is working on
"auto-apt", a tool to watch what files you try to use and automatically
install them on the fly. (873dllhktx.wl@lichee.ukai.org)

<p>
Last week's mention of the upcoming Deb Freshmeat Repository sparked some
discussion on debian-devel about third party packages and related topics.
Many developers worry about third party packages being of low quality, and
so on, although others point out that very well done third party packages
(like Helix Gnome debs) do exist.

<p>
Here are <a href="http://www.debian.org/~mmagallo/lt2k/">some pictures</a> of
Debian people in a 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~mmagallo/lt2k/tag3-009.html">crowded booth</a>
at LinuxTag. The Zeroth Debian conference is coming up at the end of this
week, and DWN will report on it in the next edition.
</p>

<p>
And finally, here is
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/enterprise/stories/main/0%2c10228%2c2598156%2c00.html">
an article</a> by one reporter who really understands Debian (and reads
debian-devel). "<i>Debian stands out as the primary Linux distribution
that is a community, as opposed to other distributions that simply
have communities.</i> 
[...]
<i>Debian's committee-type workings are occasionally cantankerous and
political, and it has never been quick to react or to release. But the
quality of its work is unquestioned, as is the group's commitment to
software freedom.</i>"
