<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition.
</p>

<p>
The Zeroth Debian Conference took place last week, between the
5th and 9th of July, in Bourdeaux, France. During the Conference many
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic18_en.html">topics</a> were
presented, including two introductory talks on the Hurd, given by Neal
Walfield and Richard M. Stallman; an overview of Debian 
<a href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/talks/">past and
present</a>, as well as some brief discussion about a new package
format, given by Wichert Akkerman; <a href="http://www.pingoo.org/">PingOO</a>,
a project to provide schools with communication servers administered remotely 
by a distributed team, and <a href="http://www.openrock.net/">Telemetry
Software</a> (management and diagnostics
of networks and servers) provided by <a href="http://www.siterock.com/">
SiteRock</a>, both of them based on Debian GNU/Linux. Major discussions
took place around the topics of Debian's internal organization and the new
maintainer process. Here are more details
(200007101646.SAA09680@topaze.ecf.teradyne.com).
Plans (20000710225126.D1745@polynum.com) are already underway for the
First Debian Conference next July.

<b>Security fixes:</b> A remote exploit in canna has been
<a href="../../../..//security/2000/20000702">closed</a>, as has a remote
root shell exploit in proftpd. (** find profptd proftpd 1.2.0pre10-2
announce -- still in Incoming now **)

AJ posted an update (20000702165908.A18888@azure.humbug.org.au) on the
<b>status of test cycle 3</b>, which begins Real Soon Now. "<i>The purpose
of the third test cycle is simply to ensure that we're ready to release:
we believe the previous two cycles have shaken out most of the bugs in the
install procedure, so we don't expect major problems.</i>" Randolph Chung
said in an install report (20000703105653.B548@codepoet.org) of the latest
boot-floppies build, "<i>So I'd say [boot-floppies] 2.2.16 for i386 is
definitely ready for upload, and probably ready for potato release.</i>"
Things have been slightly delayed though, with so many Debian people,
including AJ, at the Zeroth Debian Conference.

<p>
<b>Saying goodbye to libc5.</b> Ben Collins proposed that all the libc5
support packages be removed from unstable, since it has been years since
Debian was a libc5 distribution and keeping libc5 support has led to a
"<i>lot of very old cruft and hacks</i>" still being in Debian. Ben asked if
anyone had "<i>compelling reasons to continue to have it around</i>", and so
far no one has thought of any.

Paul J Thompson posted about Debian reaching "<i>critical mass</i>" of
public recognization. He cited the increasing number of 
<a href="../../../../related_links#basedon">distributions based on Debian</a>,
the many people and projects that are beginning to release debian packages and
support Debian, etc. With growth comes problems, and Paul identified two keys
problems that are nothing new: the unweildly number of packages, and release
schedule difficulties. He went on make a "<i>radical</i>" suggestion to
address the problems -- split up Debian into several sections like core,
rapid development, and so on, that have different release schedules. It's an
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02182.html">
interesting message</a>, well worth reading even if you
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02209.html">
disagree</a> with his ideas.
</p>

Other interesting things: Chuan-kai Lin has set up
(8k49on$3g1$1@www.phys.ntu.edu.tw) a 
<a href="http://oink.cc.ntu.edu.tw/~cklin/signing/index.html">web page</a>
devoted to tracking key signing requests. Fumitoshi UKAI is working on
"auto-apt", a tool to watch what files you try to use and automatically
install them on the fly. (873dllhktx.wl@lichee.ukai.org) 
Data and graphs (200007101422.QAA08825@topaze.ecf.teradyne.com) are available
on the number of subscribers and amount of traffic on Debian lists.

And finally, here is
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/enterprise/stories/main/0%2c10228%2c2598156%2c00.html">
an article</a> by one reporter who really understands Debian (and reads
debian-devel). "<i>Debian stands out as the primary Linux distribution
that is a community, as opposed to other distributions that simply
have communities.</i> 
[...]
<i>Debian's committee-type workings are occasionally cantankerous and
political, and it has never been quick to react or to release. But the
quality of its work is unquestioned, as is the group's commitment to
software freedom.</i>"
