<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Zeroth Debian Conference took place last week</b> in Bourdeaux,
France. During the Conference many
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic18_en.html">topics</a> were
presented, including two introductory talks on the Hurd, given by Neal
Walfield and Richard M. Stallman; an overview of Debian 
<a href="http://www.wi.leidenuniv.nl/~wichert/talks/">past and
present</a>, as well as some brief discussion about a new package
format, given by Wichert Akkerman; <a href="http://www.pingoo.org/">PingOO</a>,
a project to provide schools with communication servers administered remotely 
by a distributed team, and <a href="http://www.openrock.net/">Telemetry
Software</a> (management and diagnostics
of networks and servers) provided by <a href="http://www.siterock.com/">
SiteRock</a>, both of them based on Debian GNU/Linux. Major discussions
took place around the topics of Debian's internal organization and the new
maintainer process. <a href="mail#2">Plans</a> are already underway for the
First Debian Conference next July.

Anthony Towns 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0007/msg00000.html">
posted an update</a> on the <b>status of test cycle 3</b>, which begins Real
Soon Now. "<i>The purpose of the third test cycle is simply to ensure that
we're ready to release: we believe the previous two cycles have shaken out
most of the bugs in the install procedure, so we don't expect major
problems.</i>" Randolph Chung said in
an <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-0007/msg00006.html">
install report</a> of the latest boot-floppies build that boot-floppies
"<i>2.2.16 for i386 is definitely ready for upload, and probably ready for
potato release.</i>" Things have been slightly delayed though, with so many
Debian people at the Zeroth Debian Conference.
</p>

<p>
<b>Saying goodbye to libc5.</b> Ben Collins <a href="mail#1">proposed</a>
that all the libc5 support packages be removed from unstable, since it has
been years since Debian was a libc5 distribution and keeping libc5 support
has led to a "<i>lot of very old cruft and hacks</i>". Ben asked if
anyone had "<i>compelling reasons to continue to have it around</i>", and so
far no one has thought of any.
</p>

<p>
Paul J Thompson thinks that <b>Debian is reaching "<i>critical mass</i>" of
public recognization</b>. He cites the increasing number of 
<a href="../../../../related_links#basedon">distributions based on Debian</a>,
the many people and projects that are beginning to release debian packages and
support Debian, etc. With growth comes problems, and Paul identifies two key
problems that are nothing new: the unweildly number of packages, and release
schedule difficulties. He goes on make a "<i>radical</i>" suggestion to
address the problems -- split up Debian into several sections like core,
rapid development, and so on, that have different release schedules. It's an
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02181.html">
interesting message</a>, well worth reading even if you
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg02209.html">
disagree</a> with his ideas.
</p>

<p>
<b>More news tidbits:</b>
<ul>
<li>Chuan-kai Lin has 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0007/msg00327.html">set
up</a> a  <a href="http://oink.cc.ntu.edu.tw/~cklin/signing/index.html">web
page</a> devoted to tracking key signing requests.
<li>Fumitoshi UKAI is working on
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0007/msg00341.html">auto-apt</a>,
a tool that tracks the files you try to use and automatically installs them on
the fly.
<li>Slashdot is

And finally, here is
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/enterprise/stories/main/0%2c10228%2c2598156%2c00.html">
an article</a> by one reporter who really understands Debian (and reads
debian-devel). "<i>Debian stands out as the primary Linux distribution
that is a community, as opposed to other distributions that simply
have communities.</i> 
[...]
<i>Debian's committee-type workings are occasionally cantankerous and
political, and it has never been quick to react or to release. But the
quality of its work is unquestioned, as is the group's commitment to
software freedom.</i>"
