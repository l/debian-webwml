<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

AJ posted an update on the status of test cycle 3, which begins Real Soon
Now. "<i>The purpose of the third test cycle is simply to ensure that we're
ready to release: we believe the previous two cycles have shaken out most of
the bugs in the install procedure, so we don't expect major problems.</i>"

Paul J Thompson posted about Debian reaching "<i>critical mass</i>" of
public recognization. He cited the increasing number of 
<a href="../../../../related_links#basedon">distributions based on Debian</a>,
the many people and projects that are beginning to
release debian packages and support Debian, etc. With growth comes
problems, and Paul identified two keys problems that are nothing new:
the unweildly number of packages, and release schedule problems. He went
on make a "<i>radical</i>" suggestion to address the problems -- split
up Debian into several sections like core, rapid development, and so on,
that have different release schedules. It's an interesting message, well
worth reading (xnovgyrf8pe.fsf@vile.diku.dk) even if you disagree with
his ideas.

Last week's mention of the upcoming Deb Freshmeat Repository sparked some
discussion on debian-devel about third party packages and related topics.
Many developers worry about third party packages being of low quality, and
so on, although others point out that very well done third party packages
(like Helix Gnome debs) do exist.

Here are <a href="http://www.debian.org/~mmagallo/lt2k/">some pictures</a> of
Debian people in a 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~mmagallo/lt2k/tag3-009.html">crowded booth</a>
at LinuxTag. The Zeroth Debian conference is coming up at the end of this
week, and DWN will report on it in the next edition.
