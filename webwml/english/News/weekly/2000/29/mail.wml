Hi guys,

I'm going to blithely assume the -cd and -boot and any other interested
folks are watching.

Here's what I'm thinking for r1, anyway. I'm thinking a timeframe of
a couple of weeks, so around the last week of September and the first
week of October.

I'm thinking we'll want to include:

	* security updates that missed r0 (big surprise)

	* recompiled binaries on, eg, arm that were out of date or ususable

	* any bug fixes the boot-floppies people have come up with

	* new boot-floppies / base.tgz's for all arches to match the fixes
	  and any base package updates

	* source updates to some base packages like xviddetect (these'll
	  need to be recompiled on all architectures, and done before
	  boot-floppies are rebuilt)

	* source updates to various packages that had known important
	  bugs that were fixed too late for r0 (these'll also need to
	  be recompiled for all architectures)

	* updated release notes

I'm also inclined to let in a couple of interesting, non-essential,
bug-free packages that didn't make potato r0.  I think the following
rules are reasonable:

	* only allowing at most a handful of packages fitting this description
	* the package should have no RC bugs
	* there should be something particularly interesting and worthwhile
          about the package
	* it should be Priority: extra, so it's as out of the way as possible
	* it shouldn't be in base, or by a task- package (again, so as to be
	  as out of the way as possible)

console-apt seems like a good candidate, to my mind. Perhaps a -2.4.x-test
kernel might be another.

Cheers,
aj
