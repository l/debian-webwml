<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>It should be safe to use unstable again.</b> With 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0009/msg02620.html">
this upload of glibc</a>, the change that caused most of the problems was
reverted. The db2 libraries will remain in Debian's glibc for the time
being to provide backwards compatibility. Ben Collins
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg02198.html">explains</a>:
"<i>I don't have time to list everything it fixes, but I can tell you that 
it fixes EVERY issue that EVERYONE was having.</i>"

<b>Discussion this week focused on the bug tracking system</b>, especially the
(ab)use of bug severities. It started off with
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0009/msg02232.html">this post</a> from Anthony
Towns, who is not the first to notice that far too many bug reports seem to be
flagged important. Anthony wondered if changing the definition of important
bugs could help with this problem. The ensuing discussion revealed some
disquieting things. There is a growing perception among both users and 
developers that normal severity bugs are often ignored, and an inflated
severity is needed to ensure a bug gets attention. As Sean Perry
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg00101.html">
put it</a>, "<i>short of lighting a fire under someone, some bugs
are simply ignored.</i>" One way to combat this perception, be it true or
false, is to become more active in fixing as many bugs as possible. Anthony
proposed that "<i>maybe we should have some bugsquash months instead of just 
bugsquash weekends</i>" and wondered if we could make it a release goal to 
ship with only 8000 open bugs. Even users can help; it's now easy to 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg00048.html">look up 
all the bugs you have submitted</a>. (There is even a 
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">search form</a> on the web site.) When
Roland Rosenfeld did that, he said he was "<i>shocked how many of them were
still open.  Some of them were already fixed in the packages, but the
maintainer had forgotten to close the bug reports. Some trivial to fix bugs
weren't attac(k)ed for months or years </i>" Every bug reporter can take a
look at the bugs they've filed, close any that have accidentally been fixed
but not closed, and perhaps send the maintainer a gentle reminder to do
something about the rest. The problems discussed in this thread can't be
solved easily, only a great deal of hard work can make all bugs be dealt
with promptly.
