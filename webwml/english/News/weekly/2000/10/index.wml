<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is another combined two week edition -- the news business
is slow in the middle of a freeze.
</p>

<p>
Election results (20000317004705.17550.qmail@master.debian.org): Wichert
Akkerman was re-elected Debian project Leader. Congradulations to Wichert,
and thanks to the other candidates who volenteered for the job.
</p>

<p>
Debian 2.1r5 has been released. (200003231751.SAA22317@topaze.ecf.teradyne.com)
Like the last couple of minor releases, it consists of security and Y2K
updates.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Debian's vast corporate might.</b> This
<a href="http://www.macdiscussion.com/article_show.php3?article_id_var=190">
article</a> talks about how ports of major distributions to the PPC may
affect existing distributions there: "<i>Linux PPC and Yellow Dog Linux are
relatively new upstart companies when it comes to the Linux world, and they
just do not have the corporate power and user base that both Debian and SuSE
boast.</i> Despite that small gaffe, it does raise some interesting questions.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new master archive server</b> is in the works, thanks to an impressive
<a href="../../../../News/2000/20000317">hardware donation</a> from Sun. The
new server will eventually take over some of the duties of master.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
Confirmation: Transmeta's Mobile Linux is based on Debian, as was rumored
here earlier. (38D70555.78661D2@transmeta.com)

Every week Debian Weekly News reports on a very few of the more important
and newsworthy happennings in Debian. But don't be fooled by the apparent
slimness of these summaries. A <em>lot</em> is happening beneath the
surface, as <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0316/backpage.phtml#backpage">this
letter</a> points out:
<blockquote>
I was recently auditing some data I had collected from the Debian project
and came across the following statistic:  Code changes are submitted to
or accepted by the Debian project once every 13 seconds to 7 minutes
(depending on time of day).  In other words, in the time it takes to
dial a 1-800 number, someone may have fixed a bug in or added a feature
to Debian, sometimes before the first ring, and definitely before you
finally get off the holding queue and talk to a real human being.
