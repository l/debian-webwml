<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is another combined two week edition -- the news business
is slow in the middle of a freeze.
</p>

<p>
Election results (20000317004705.17550.qmail@master.debian.org): Wichert
Akkerman was re-elected Debian project Leader. Congradulations to Wichert,
and thanks to the other candidates who volenteered for the job.
</p>

<p>
Debian 2.1r5 has been released. (200003231751.SAA22317@topaze.ecf.teradyne.com)
Like the last couple of minor releases, it consists of security and Y2K
updates.
</p>

<p>
The second bug horizon has been passed. (20000327173853.A18111@xs4all.nl)
28 packages were not fixed in time, of those about 12 are too important to
really be removed. Though it is clear that bug horizons do work to reduce
the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">number of release
critical bugs</a>, they're not as effective at motivating people to fix
bugs in very important packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Debian's vast corporate might.</b> This
<a href="http://www.macdiscussion.com/article_show.php3?article_id_var=190">
article</a> talks about how ports of major distributions to the PPC may
affect existing distributions there: "<i>Linux PPC and Yellow Dog Linux are
relatively new upstart companies when it comes to the Linux world, and they
just do not have the corporate power and user base that both Debian and SuSE
boast.</i> Despite that small gaffe, it does raise some interesting questions.
</p>

<p>
A thread about default colors of programs like mutt, ls, and so on has
raised some interesting issues. Anyone who is not a "<i>bug-eyed alien</i>"
with ultraviolet vision (38D79372.55D9ABDC@efore.fi) has probably struggled to
read dark blue text on a black background, or bright yellow text on a white
background, before giving up and changing a program's colors to something more
usable. Two things are keeping Debian from changing the colors by default:
First, there's a lot of variation in personal preferences
(20000323135059.A16015@molehole.dyndns.org) and setups; some use a black
background, and some a white. It's difficult to come up with default colors
that work well on both backgrounds. Second, large changes from upstream
defaults are likely to annoy just as many people as they please. So while we
can fix extremly bad default color choices, the rest will still have to be up
to the individual user.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new master archive server</b> is in the works, thanks to an impressive
<a href="../../../../News/2000/20000317">hardware donation</a> from Sun. The
new server will eventually take over some of the duties of master.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
The amount of spam to Debian lists, the bug tracking system, and individual
developers has been on the rise lately. What can we do about it? Jason
Gunthorpe looked at the effects of using 4 different RBLs
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1000325221736.13200H-100000@wakko.deltatee.com). Most people
agree that any additional spam-blocking should be carefully considered, to
make sure we don't alos block legitimate Debian users.
</p>

<p>
Confirmation: Transmeta's Mobile Linux is based on Debian, as was rumored
earlier. (38D70555.78661D2@transmeta.com)
</p>

<p>
Every week Debian Weekly News reports on a very few of the more important
and newsworthy happennings in Debian. But don't be fooled by the apparent
slimness of these summaries. A <em>lot</em> is happening beneath the
surface, as <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0316/backpage.phtml#backpage">this
letter</a> points out:
<blockquote>
I was recently auditing some data I had collected from the Debian project
and came across the following statistic:  Code changes are submitted to
or accepted by the Debian project once every 13 seconds to 7 minutes
(depending on time of day).  In other words, in the time it takes to
dial a 1-800 number, someone may have fixed a bug in or added a feature
to Debian, sometimes before the first ring, and definitely before you
finally get off the holding queue and talk to a real human being.
