<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Every week Debian Weekly News reports on a very few of the more important
and newsworthy happennings in Debian. But don't be fooled by the apparent
slimness of these summaries. A <em>lot</em> is happening beneath the
surface, as <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0316/backpage.phtml#backpage">this
letter</a> points out:
<blockquote>
I was recently auditing some data I had collected from the Debian project
and came across the following statistic:  Code changes are submitted to
or accepted by the Debian project once every 13 seconds to 7 minutes
(depending on time of day).  In other words, in the time it takes to
dial a 1-800 number, someone may have fixed a bug in or added a feature
to Debian, sometimes before the first ring, and definitely before you
finally get off the holding queue and talk to a real human being.
