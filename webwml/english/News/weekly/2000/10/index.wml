<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00016.html">
Election results</a>: <b>Wichert Akkerman was re-elected Debian project
Leader.</b> Congratulations to Wichert, and thanks to the other candidates
who volunteered for the job.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian 2.1r5</b> has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce-00/msg00004.html">
released</a>. Like the last couple of minor releases, it consists of security
and Y2K updates.
</p>

<p>
<b>We're now past the second bug horizon.</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00022.html">
28 packages</a> were not fixed in time, of those about 12 are too important to
really be removed. Though it is clear that bug horizons do work to reduce
the <a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">number of release
critical bugs</a>, they're not as effective at motivating people to fix
bugs in very important packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Beware Debian's vast corporate might.</b> This
<a href="http://www.macdiscussion.com/article_show.php3?article_id_var=190">
article</a> talks about how ports of major distributions to the PowerPC may
affect existing distributions there: "<i>Linux PPC and Yellow Dog Linux are
relatively new upstart companies when it comes to the Linux world, and they
just do not have the corporate power and user base that both Debian and SuSE
boast.</i> Despite that small gaffe, it does raise some interesting questions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Does the policy process need to be reformed?</b> It certainly can have
problems, as in the case of the /usr/share/doc issue last year, when things
are added to policy without enough forethought. Ian Jackson believes that
the policy process needs to be
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0003/msg00151.html">changed
back</a> to something like what it was 2 years ago, with a few people having
absolute control over policy. Others
<a href="mail#mail1">disagree</a>, and think that while adding a
chairman to the process may be a good idea, the process should remain in the
hands of the people on the debian-policy mailing list. This will be discussed
further <a href="mail#mail2">on IRC</a> on the 29th.
</p>

<p>
<b>A thread about default colors of programs</b> like mutt, ls, and so on has
raised some interesting issues. Anyone who is not a "<i>bug-eyed alien</i>"
with <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg01096.html">
ultraviolet vision</a> has probably struggled to read dark blue text on a
black background, or bright yellow text on a white background, before giving
up and changing a program's colors to something more usable. Two things are
keeping Debian from changing the colors by default: First, there's a lot of
variation in
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg01243.html">personal
preferences and setups</a>; some use a black background, and some a white.
It's difficult to come up with default colors that work well on both
backgrounds. Second, large changes from upstream defaults are likely to annoy
just as many people as they please. So while we can fix extremely bad default
color choices, the rest will still have to be up to the individual user.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new master archive server</b> is in the works, thanks to an impressive
<a href="../../../../News/2000/20000317">hardware donation</a> from Sun. The
new server will eventually take over some of the duties of master.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
<b>The amount of spam to Debian lists, the bug tracking system, and individual
developers has been on the rise lately.</b> What can we do about it? Jason
Gunthorpe looked at the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0003/msg01325.html">
effects of using 4 different RBLs</a>. Most people agree that any additional
spam-blocking should be carefully considered, to make sure we don't also block
legitimate Debian users.
</p>

Confirmation</a>: <b>Transmeta's Mobile Linux is based on Debian</b>, as
was rumored earlier.

Every week Debian Weekly News reports on a very few of the more important
and newsworthy happenings in Debian. But don't be fooled by the apparent
slimness of these summaries. A <em>lot</em> is happening beneath the
surface, as <a href="http://lwn.net/2000/0316/backpage.phtml#backpage">this
letter</a> points out:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
I was recently auditing some data I had collected from the Debian project
and came across the following statistic:  Code changes are submitted to
or accepted by the Debian project once every 13 seconds to 7 minutes
(depending on time of day).  In other words, in the time it takes to
dial a 1-800 number, someone may have fixed a bug in or added a feature
to Debian, sometimes before the first ring, and definitely before you
finally get off the holding queue and talk to a real human being.
