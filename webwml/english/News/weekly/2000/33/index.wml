<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

<p>
Vladimir Vukicevic has managed to squeeze Debian onto Compaq's IPaq handheld
computer, and has written a 
<a href="http://primates.helixcode.com/~vladimir/ipaq/debian-ipaq-howto.html">
HOWTO</a> describing the process. Aside from some missing informatio in
section 1.2.2, it looks fairly painless. It does require a compact flash
card be used with the IPaq for the root filesystem.
