<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
We've now passed the first Release Critical Bug Horizon, and 20 packages
have been removed from Debian (20000305173307.A27127@xs4all.nl -- ****
HASN't HAPPENED YET ****)
The bug horizon has been a success, based on the number of release critical
bugs that have been closed in the past 2 weeks -- only 190 remain open 
(***** UPDATE *****), down
from 300+ a few weeks ago. There are fewer open RC bugs in Debian now than any
time since last summer. http://bugs.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/
</p>

<p>
<b>Project leader elections close in just a few days. Do remember to vote
(20000302184053.8072.qmail@master.debian.org). Linux.com has posted
interviews with <a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/41/">Wichert
Akkerman</a> and </a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/42/">Matthew
Vernon</a>. Joel Klecker was not interviwed, but he did make a breif statement
(v0422080fb4dac3312cb2@[206.163.71.146])
</p>

<p>
Install Debian wherever you go: The latest version of LinuxCare's
<a href="http://www.linuxcare.com/bootable_cd/">Bootable Business Card</a> now
allows installation of the Debian base system, right off the mini-CD.
</p>

<p>
Ddiff was announced (20000226175342.A7579@onegeek.org). Ddiff is a tool to
generate binary diffs between different versions of .deb packages.
</p>

<p>
Two security problems were fixed this week. Fixes are available for
remote exploits of the 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00005.html">
nmh</a>, and
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00004.html">
htdig</a> packages in slink. There was discussion of a man exploit on
bugtraq, but Debian uses a different man package and is not vunerable.
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs-20000306.html">19 more</a>:
