<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined 2 week summary.
</p>

<p>
<b>We've now passed the first Release Critical Bug Horizon</b>, and 20 packages
will soon be
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00007.html">
removed from potato</a>. The bug horizon has been a success, based on the
number of release critical bugs that have been closed in the past 2 weeks --
for a while less than 200 were open, down from 300+ a few weeks ago -- fewer RC
bugs than any time since last summer. The
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">number of bugs</a> is on the
rise again though, and another bug horizon may be called.
</p>

<p>
<b>Project leader elections close in just a few days.</b> Do remember to 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0003/msg00002.html">
vote</a>. Linux.com has posted interviews with 
<a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/41/">Wichert Akkerman</a> and 
<a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/42/">Matthew Vernon</a>. Joel 
Klecker was not interviewed, but he did make a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0002/msg01796.html">brief
statement</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Two new ways to show people Debian in action:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Debian wherever you go with the latest version of LinuxCare's
<a href="http://open-projects.linuxcare.com/BBC/">Bootable Business Card</a> 
which allows installation of the Debian base system, right off the mini-CD.
<li>Compaq's <a href="mail#1">testdrive program</a> now includes accounts on
i386 and alpha Debian systems.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Ddiff</b> was 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0002/msg01907.html">
announced</a>. Ddiff is a tool to generate binary diffs between different
versions of .deb packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Two security problems were fixed this week.</b> Fixes are available for
remote exploits of the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00005.html">
nmh</a> and
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00004.html">
htdig</a> packages in slink. There was discussion of a man exploit on
bugtraq, but Debian uses a different man package and is not vulnerable.
Similarly, bugtraq discussion indicates we aren't vulnerable to the 
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.org/vdb/bottom.html?section=discussion&amp;vid=1030">dosemu
problems</a> present in Corel Linux.
</p>

<p>
