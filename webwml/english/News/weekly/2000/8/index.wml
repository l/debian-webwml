<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
We've now passed the first Release Critical Bug Horizon, but threatened
packages get one more chance: Richard Braakman will be mailing maintainers of
packages that are to be removed, and any fixes that happen in this time can
still save those packages. The bug horizon has already been a success,
based on the number of release critical bugs that have been closed in the
past 2 weeks -- only 177 remain open, down from 300+ a few weeks ago. There
are fewer open RC bugs in Debian now than any time since last summer.

<b>Project leader elections close in just a few days. Do remember to vote
(20000302184053.8072.qmail@master.debian.org). Linux.com has posted
interviews with <a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/41/">Wichert
Akkerman</a> and </a href="http://linux.com/interviews/20000224/42/">Matthew
Vernon</a>. Joel Klecker was not interviwed, but he made a breif statement
(v0422080fb4dac3312cb2@[206.163.71.146])

<p>
Ddiff was announced (20000226175342.A7579@onegeek.org). Ddiff is a tool to
generate binary diffs between different versions of .deb packages.

<p>
Two security problems were fixed this week. Fixes are available for
remote exploits of the 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00005.html">
nmh</a>, and
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00004.html">
htdig</a> packages in slink. There was discussion of a man exploit on
bugtraq, but Debian uses a different man package and is not vunerable.
