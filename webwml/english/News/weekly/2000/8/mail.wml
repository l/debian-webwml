Subject: Debian Added to Compaq Test Drive Program

Debian Distribution Part of Compaq Test Drive Program

&gt;&gt; News 
  
The Compaq Testdrive program has recently added Debian's frozen GNU/Linux 
distribution, potato (aka, Debian 2.2) to the list of systems available 
for use. 

Compaq is now making testdrives available via the Internet for the Open 
Source community. This is a program that lets users world-wide get a 
shell account, free of charge, for development and testing purposes. 

By registering for a shell account at <a href="http://www.testdrive.compaq.com">http://www.testdrive.compaq.com</a>
developers can evaluate the Debian distributions running on Compaq 
AlphaServers and ProLiant Servers.  Current Debian systems are: 
AlphaServer DS20 (ev6), AlphaServer XP1000a(ev6.7), and ProLiant 
5500 (x86 PIII). All systems have at least two (2) gigs of ram and as 
much as 100 gigs of "/home" storage courtesy of a network file system. 

The AlphaServers have the latest Compaq optimized FORTRAN compilers as 
well as the GNU tools installed. 
  
These machines provide an excellent means  for interested parties to 
try out the Debian distribution. In addition, they provide valuable 
uptime and stability statistics on newer hardware that can be used to 
isolate and correct potential problems on new architectures. These 
machines should not be used for benchmarking purposes as at any given 
time there are numerous users working on them. 

Debian whishes to thank all of the contributors of the system, especially 
Michael Waite (Compaq), and David Huggins-Daines, Christian Meder,
and Christopher C. Chimelis  (all of Debian) for their hard work in
configuring and administering these resources.
