Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, the "Joel 'Espy' Klecker" release

The Debian Project is pleased to announce the latest release of the
Debian GNU/Linux Operating System.  This release has been in
development for approximately 18 months, and has been extensively
tested by several thousand developers and end-users.

Debian GNU/Linux is a free Linux system.  It is developed by roughly
500 volunteers from all over the world who collaborate via the
Internet.  Debian's dedication to free software, its non-profit
nature, and its open development model make it unique among Linux
distributions.

With the addition of the PowerPC and ARM architectures, Debian
GNU/Linux now supports a total of six architectures -- more than any
other distribution.  Packages for all architectures are built from the
same source packages.  Debian GNU/Linux now runs on iMacs and
Netwinders, and of course Intel PC's, Sun SPARCs, Alphas, and older
Macintosh and Amiga hardware are still supported.

Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 features a more streamlined and polished
installation, including automatic network setup via DHCP, a simplified
software selection process (just indicate the tasks your Debian
GNU/Linux system will be used for), and a simplified configurator for
the X Window System.  Debian GNU/Linux can be installed via CD, or
from the network and a few floppies:

  FTP:		ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/
  Mirrors:	http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist 
  CD-ROM:	http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors
  CD Images:	http://cdimage.debian.org/

Upgrades to Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 from earlier releases are
automatically handled by the apt package management tool.  As always,
Debian GNU/Linux systems can be upgraded painlessly, in place, with no
downtime.  For detailed documentation about installing and upgrading
Debian GNU/Linux, please see <http://www.debian.org/releases/2.2/>.

Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is based on the latest stable Linux kernel
(2.2.16), updated with Alan Cox's patches expected to go into 2.2.17.
The 2.2 kernel series includes significant improvements in usability
and stability; it also includes more hardware support, for both older
and newer products; laptop users will particularly notice improvements
in the PCMCIA subsystem.  Some other highlights of Debian GNU/Linux
2.2 from the nearly 800 updated packages include:

   o C Library	2.1.3
   o XFree86	3.3.6
   o GCC	2.95.2
   o GnuPG	1.0.1
   o Perl	5.005.03
   o Python	1.5.2
   o PAM	0.72
   o ncurses	5.0
   o teTeX	1.0.6
   o Emacs	20.7
   o XEmacs	21.1.10
   o GNOME	1.0.56 [1]

1200 new software packages have been added to Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.
Some of the newly available software include:

   o postfix	A new secure mail transport agent
   o openssh	A free implementation of the secure shell
   o openldap	LDAP client and server packages
   o w3m	A new text-mode browser, with support for tables
   o gdm	The GNOME display manager
   o cvsup	An efficient mirroring system for CVS
   o everybuddy	An all-in-one messaging client
   o reportbug	A tool to report problems in Debian GNU/Linux
   o zope	A web application server for dynamic web sites
   o xmms	The X Multimedia System; an audio player
   o kaffe	A free, JIT-capable, virtual machine for Java bytecode
   o gnapster	An interface to the popular MP3 sharing service
   o And last, but not least, 56 new games.

Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 incorporates not only a great deal of updated and
new software, but many enhancements, such as:

   o Widespread use of the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM).
     With PAM, Debian GNU/Linux systems can be configured with
     standard Unix passwords or more secure options such as shadow and
     MD5 passwords, "smart cards", and one-time-password
     implementations.
   o A new network configuration system, configured through the
     /etc/network directory, which improves support for multihomed
     hosts.
   o Closer compliance to the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 
     (FHS), including a better separation between system-specific,
     architecture-specific, and architecture-independent data for
     use in heterogeneous environments.
   o Better support for international users.  Japanese support is
     integrated into the core Debian archive, and other non-Latin
     character encodings are also better supported through wider 
     internationalisation (I18N) support.  European languages are
     also better supported, with more and better translations to 
     more languages.

The Debian Project has always hoped to serve as a base for more
specialised distributions, and in the past year this goal has been
realized, with the adoption of the Debian system as a basis for
commercial Linux distributions.  Corel Corporation, Libra Computer
Systems, and Stormix Technologies are among the companies that
currently distribute distributions based on Debian; others are on the
horizon.  In addition, Debian GNU/Linux CDs have been bundled with
several Debian books.  What remains the same, however, is the
project's volunteer base, its dedication to the Debian Social
Contract[2], and its commitment to provide the best operating system
possible.  Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is another important step in that
direction.

Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is dedicated[3] to the memory of Joel "Espy"
Klecker, a Debian developer, unbeknownst to most of the Debian
Project, was bedridden and fighting a disease known as Duchenne
Muscular Dystrophy during most of his involvement with Debian.  Only
now is the Debian Project realizing the extent of his dedication, and
the friendship he bestowed upon us.  So as a show of appreciation, and
in memory of his inspirational life, this release of Debian GNU/Linux
is dedicated to him.

Subject: Potato now stable

Hello world,

Well, as some of you might have noticed:

  ajt@auric:/org/ftp.debian.org/ftp/dists$ ls -l Debian2.2r0 stable   
  lrwxrwxrwx    1 troup    debadmin        6 Aug 14 13:06 Debian2.2r0 -&gt; stable
  lrwxrwxrwx    1 troup    debadmin        6 Aug 14 13:06 stable -&gt; potato

CD images and the archive are being mirrored more or less as I type.

So you can expect the prepared announcement to go out soon (it's scheduled
for the "official release time" of 00:00 GMT).

Some things that won't make the "real" announcement follow. First, some
thanks are due to some of the people without whom potato wouldn't have
made it through these final stages:

	* Branden Robinson, Ben Collins, Steve Gore, and Mike Renfro for
	  tracking down and fixing some X problems at the 11th hour.

	* Daniel Jacobowitz, for somehow getting PowerPC support from
	  shaky to first class, and tracking down and fixing problems
	  right up until the 11th hour and fiftieth minute.

	* Ben Collins and Steve Gore, for making sure potato's sparc
	  support is as good as possible, and tracking down and fixing
	  problems right up until the 11th hour and fifty-fifth minute.

	* Martin Schulze, for tidying up some security fixes at very
	  short notice.

	* Adam Di Carlo and Josip Rodin, for keeping our release notes as
	  up to date as possible.

	* Phil Hands for getting complete CD sets up and mirrored
	  almost as quick as you can say "oh my god, cdimage.debian.org
	  has crashed again!"

	* James Troup, who kept the archive in tip-top shape throughout.

By omission, this does a fairly impressive injustice to everyone else
who helped with development, testing, fixing bugs, documenting problems
and work arounds, giving support, and everything else everyone's done
in the past months, so, well, thanks everyone!

So that means we can start really focussing on the next release: woody.

Well, after focussing on partying like it's the year after 1999, perhaps.

Once we get to woody, though, there are probably two things that are
particularly worthwhile doing. As per usual, we should probably have a few
weeks discussing "release goals" for woody to see what sort of direction
we want to head (and then going ahead and implementing whatever we feel
like anyway). As well, (and here's where you might be able to pick up
the fact I've been reading too many management books recently [0]),
I think it's probably a good idea if we go over some of the things that
went wrong this time and see what we can to fix them, and which things
went right so we know to keep doing it.

So, first, here's a rough idea of some of the things I think went wrong and
right. (Technical followups to debian-devel@lists.debian.org)

	* Tasks are great, but task-* packages suck when some of the
	  packages included have release critical bugs. (Remove the
	  package, the entire task breaks)

	* boot-floppies, kernels (and modules), and release notes are
	  all a pain to get uploaded and installed.

	* Working out which bugs are really release-critical and fixing
	  their severity so we know where we're at is overly time
	  consuming.

	* Getting security updates installed is suboptimal: some don't get
	  built properly; some don't get put in incoming for dinstall
	  to process.

	* Testing updates to frozen is suboptimal: updates go into
	  incoming, wait there for a while, get added to frozen,
	  we discover they introduce as many release critical bugs
	  as they solve, rinse, repeat. The "wait for a while" part
	  is particularly suboptimal, but without it, it's not really
	  a freeze.

	* boot-floppies needs huge amounts of time to get into a
	  functional state: from November or so 1999 to June 2000 this
	  time, roughly.

	* debian-cd scripts seem to be working great: the "minimal
	  rsync" to update the images between test cycle three and the
	  release seem to be working fine, and the separate non-us CD#1
	  seems like a great idea to me.

	* The autobuilders cope *really* well with most updates. The
	  security team also seem to have perfected getting updates
	  recompiles really quickly on all architectures when it's
	  necessary too. All very impressive.

There's probably lots more good things too, the above is probably
hopelessly biassed towards the bad.

In addition, here's my understanding of goals already being worked on for
woody (and who's working on it, and where to talk about it). Technical
discussion should go to debian-devel@lists.debian.org.

	* New "testing" distribution
		This is a (mostly finished) project that will allow us
		to test out distribution by making it "sludgey" rather
		than frozen: that is, a new distribution is added between
		stable and unstable, that is regularly and automatically
		updated with new packages from unstable when they've
		had a little testing and now new RC bugs.

		(Anthony Towns; debian-devel)

	* Dinstall Rewrite / Package Pools
		There's a lot of interest in updating dinstall to better
		cope with our archive and the various new ideas we want to
		deal with. A new layout of the archive itself, and a
		new process for packages to enter the archive and become
		members of some of our distributions are probably involved.

		(Anthony Towns, Jason Gunthorpe, Richard Braakman, among
		 others; debian-pool)
		
	* Debconf Integration
		Most of the debconf infrastructure is now written,
		and it's already in production use with potato. It
		will hopefully be finished, and extended to handle all
		installation I/O.

		(Joey Hess; debian-devel / config@kitenet.net)

	* Automated Installation
		With debconf integration, hopefully we should be able to
		go a little further and support non-interactive installs
		with woody.

		(debian-devel / config@kitenet.net)

	* Apt Frontends
		dselect replacements like console-apt, gnome-apt, and
		aptitude should probably should probably be standard.

		(debian-devel)

	* IPv6 Support
		A continuing goal is more complete support for IPv6. Hopefully
		we can get some of the IPv6 patches available from various
		places mainlined in woody.	

		(debian-ipv6)	

	* Modular Install 
		The boot-floppies are being redesigned, so as to be
		more modular (and hence not require five disk images
		when you only need a couple of megabytes for your
		particular setup) and hopefully more maintainable.

		(Joey Hess; debian-boot)

This is excluding all the usual improvements to individual packages, of
course.

As a rough guide, and presuming woody is in good shape, we'll consider
freezing again in roughly six months, so think mid-February or so. Note
that this'll require, among other things, completely operational
boot-floppies for all the architectures we'll be releasing.

That's about it. Have fun!
