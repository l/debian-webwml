Security fixes: 
A hole in Zope allowed remote users to gain unauthorized access. It is
fixed. (N94RW.A.OAE.8qJl5@murphy)

An update to the mailx package was released that prevents
attackers from tricking mail into running other programs. Since there are
no exploits of this problem that are known to work on Debian, this is
mainly just a preventive measure, but upgrading to the

still a smart move.
