<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is officially released!</b> The release went off
as scheduled, despite a few <a href="mail#mail1">last minute problems</a>. 
The <a href="../../../../News/2000/20000815">release announcement</a> 
mentions support for the 
Powerpc and Arm architectures, a streamlined install process, slews of new
and updated packages, full PAM support, and improved internationalization as 
key changes in this version of Debian. Of course, it is dedicated to 
developer Joel "Espy" Klecker, who died shortly before release. Debian 2.2
is the culmination of 18 months of development, much of it chronicled here
in Debian Weekly News, and everyone in the project deserves a big "thank
you" for all their hard work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Linuxworld Expo</b> is in full swing now, and Debian's booth there is being
flooded by many attendees. A webcam is up at the booth's
<a href="http://linuxworld.debian.net/">web site</a>. Debian was awarded
the IDG/Linus Torvalds Community Award today, and in an unprecedented turn
of events, a real live press conference is being held to announce the 
release of Debian 2.2 to the world. The festivities at LinuxWorld will
continue, with a release party scheduled for Wednesday night.
</p>

<p>
<b>VA Linux Systems</b> has <a href="http://www.valinux.com/software/debian/">
announced on their web site</a> that Debian will be
available pre-installed on their systems "<i>in late 2000</i>".
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes:</b>
A <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000812">hole in Zope</a> allowed
remote users to gain unauthorised access. An update to the mailx package was 
released that prevents attackers from tricking mail into running other 
programs. Since there are no exploits of this problem that are known to 
work on Debian, this is mainly just a preventive measure, but upgrading to 
the  <a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000810">fixed package</a>
is still a smart move.
</p>

<p>
<b>It wasn't exactly a quiet week on the Debian mailing lists</b>, but the 
editor of this newsletter is at LinuxWorld and hasn't been able to read and 
report on discussions there in the usual detail. Next week, things will 
return to  normal, and we'll discover how Debian 2.2 is faring and probably 
switch  focus to the development of woody. For a first taste of that, here is
Anthony Towns, <a href="mail#mail1.1">thinking about</a> what we did right and 
wrong, this time around, and some of the major projects planned for woody.
