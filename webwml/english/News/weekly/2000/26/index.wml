#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="Debian 2.2 is released" SUMMARY=""

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p
<b>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is officially released!</b> The release went off
as scheduled, though there were a few 
<a href="mail#2">last minute problems</a>. The <a href="mail#1">release 
announcement</a> mentions support for the Powerpc and Arm architectures, a 
streamlined install process, slews of new and updated packages, full PAM 
support, and improved internationalizaton as key changes in this version of 
Debian. Of course, it is dedicated to developer Joel "Espy" Klecker, who 
died shortly before release. Debian 2.2 is the culmination of 18 months 
of development, much of it chronicled here in Debian Weekly News, and 
everyone in the project deserves a big "thank you" for all their hard 
work.

Linuxworld Expo is in full swing now, and Debian's booth there is being
flooded by many attendees. A webcam is up at the booth's
<a href="http://linuxworld.debian.net/">web site</a>. Debian was awarded
the IDG/Linus Torvalds Community Award today, and in an unprecidented turn
of events, a real live press conference is being held to announce the 
release of Debian 2.2 to the world. The festivities at LinuxWorld will
continue, with a release party scheduled for Wednesday night.

VA Linux Systems has announced on their web site that Debian will be
available pre-installed on their systmes by year's end. (*** find link,

Security fixes: 
A hole in Zope allowed remote users to gain unauthorized access. It is
fixed. (N94RW.A.OAE.8qJl5@murphy)

An update to the mailx package was released that prevents
attackers from tricking mail into running other programs. Since there are
no exploits of this problem that are known to work on Debian, this is
mainly just a preventive measure, but upgrading to the 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000810">fixed package</a> is
still a smart move.
** Check if all these got into potato, and say **

<b>It wasn't exactly a quiet week on the Debian mailing lists</b>, but the 
Editor of this newsletter is at LinuxWorld and hasn't been able to read and 
report on discussions there in the usual detail. Next week, things will 
return to  normal, and we'll discover how Debian 2.2 is faring and probably 
switch  focus to the development of woody. For a first taste of that, here is
Anthony Towns, <a href="mail#2.1">thinking about</a> what we did wrong, and 
right this time around, and some of the major projects planned for woody.
