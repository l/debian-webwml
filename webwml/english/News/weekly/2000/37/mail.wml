Subject:      Re: RedHat 7.0 (and SuSE): modutils + netkit = root compromise.

Previously Keith Owens wrote:
&gt; This bug was introduced to modutils in March 12 1999, it does not
&gt; affect modutils 2.1.121.  modprobe tries echo as the last ditch file
&gt; expansion method, using popen.  There is no good reason to do that.

It also does not affect version 2.3.11, which also mean that Debian
potato is not vulnerable.
