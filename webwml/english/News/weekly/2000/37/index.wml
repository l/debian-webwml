<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian 2.2r1 is released.</b> This update to r0 contains many security 
fixes and important bug fixes, as listed in the 
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/Debian2.2r1/ChangeLog">changelog</a>.
But in a departure from tradition, this minor release also has some new and
updated packages. Console-apt has finally made it into a released version 
of Debian, and mozilla was updated to M18. Release manager Anthony
Towns <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0011/msg00001.html">
explains</a>: "<i>I'm treating updates to stable under two principles: they
should make users notably better off; and they shouldn't ever make it harder
for users to do anything they were doing before.</i>" Adding new packages and
updating packages that were "<i>fairly broken originally </i>" meet these
criteria, though this change 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00976.html">shocked and
bothered</a> some. And indeed, there are at least 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0011/msg00016.html">two
broken packages</a> in the new release, although it is reported that
apt will simply 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg01087.html">refuse to
upgrade</a> to the broken packages.
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0011/msg00033.html">Now that
2.2r1 is released</a>, expect package pools to be rolled out soon, and r2 to
come out "<i>relatively quickly</i>".
</p>

<p>
<a name="vote"></a>
<b>A troubled vote has expired.</b> No, not in <em>that</em> election;
the Debian project secretary 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00004.html">
announced</a> that the General Resolution regarding non-free has expired 
because nothing was done about it during a four week period, and the Debian
constitution stipulates that such a seemingly dead resolution "<i>is
considered to have been withdrawn</i>". Furthermore, "<i>the recent vote was
conducted in error, and its ballots are  hereby voided and the results have
not been tabulated.</i>" With the amount of confusion surrounding that vote,
this is probably a good thing, but it is also a breakdown of Debian's
voting process. Calls for votes were posted, but the secretary did not act on
them by releasing a ballot until far too late. Of course like all other
members of Debian, the secretary is a volunteer whose time may be limited. He 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0011/msg00005.html">has
stated</a> that "<i>I am back on active status</i>", and that "<i>my lack of 
time for Debian was part of the reason for seeking new employment</i>". He is
also working to involve two other people in the process so votes can proceed
in the future even if the secretary is absent. Where do we go from here? The
GR might be re-submitted, and several related proposals are 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0011/msg00036.html">in the
wings</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>A number of security fixes were released this week.</b> There are fixes 
for a remote <a href="../../../../security/2000/20001112">denial of service
attack against bind</a>, a <a href="../../../../security/2000/20001111a">
temporary file problem in tcsh</a>, and a 
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20001111">signature verification bug
in gnupg</a>. Debian has been reported <a href="mail#mail1">not vulnerable</a> 
to a root exploit in the modutils package.
</p>

<p>
<b>Glibc 2.2 has entered unstable</b>, but this new upstream version does
not seem to have broken anything. Instead, the new packages shave about 17
megabytes off the size of every Debian system -- Ben Collins has come up 
with an <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0011/msg00649.html">
ingenious solution</a> to the unnecessary locale information problem that
was <a href="../33/#locale">previously covered</a> in DWN.
</p>

<p>
<b>Dale Scheetz <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-news-00/msg00042.html">
announced</a> that the "<i>doorway into Debian is fully open once 
again</i>"</b>, with over 100 applicants currently working their way through 
the new maintainer process, and less than 100 more waiting to begin the
process. Good job, everyone!
