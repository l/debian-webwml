<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
The second test cycle is beginning. First, right on schedule, a bunch of
packages with release critical bugs were removed from potato.
(20000526183342.A10120@xs4all.nl) No more package uploads will be accepted
except those essential to the boot floppies and CD image creation. For more
details, see Richard Braakman's announcement
(20000530214613.A8476@xs4all.nl).
</p>

<p>
The last accounced security fix in Debian was in March. We have fixed
lots of security holes (20000528225633.L6106@kitenet.net) since then, so why
haven't they been announced? There are several reasons
(20000529135901.A1377@mors.wiggy.net), according to Wichert Akkerman.
Debian's security team needs to find a few more people they can trust to
add to the team. Also, a lot of the recent security holes have affected
packages that are not in stable, and the security team does not issue
advisories about problems that only exist in frozen and unstable. However,
it also looks like significant numbers of security holes have slipped
through the cracks (20000529161942.T6106@kitenet.net), and their fixes
have not been backported to stable. One hopes that the security team
can improve this track record. If you fix a security hole in a package,
please be sure to let the security team know, so they can follow up on it.
</p>

<p>
With that said, security fixes in frozen this week include a remote shell
exploit in <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/64649">qpopper</a>, an archiver
security problem in <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/64841">mailman</a>,
a SSL certificate security problem in <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/64650">
netscape</a>, and two denial of services fixes in <a href="mail#1">X</a>.
</p>

<p>
And speaking of X, Branden Robinson explained
(20000527205235.B27528@ecn.purdue.edu) why he
has no plans to make .debs for X 4.0.0. He cited instability problems, lack
of support for the Sparc architecture, and lots of fixes upstream. 
"<i>Over two hundred distinct patches have been applied to the upstream CVS
tree to date.</i>" Brandon hopes to instead package X 4.0.1 when it is
released in mid-June.

<p>
Another Debian-based distribution has appeared. 
<a href="http://timesys.com/products/linux.html">TimeSys</a> is a distribution
targeted at hard real time applications. Read more in
<a href="http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/story?id=3922f93b0">this Upside
article</a>. Judging by
<a href="http://www.timesys.com/products/linuxoptions.html">this page</a>,
the actual distribution seems to be a fairly standard Debian plus some
additional "<i>TimeSys Linux/RT modules</i>".
