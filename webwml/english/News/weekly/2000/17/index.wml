<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>"<i>The second test cycle starts now</i>"</b>, <a href="mail#mail2">writes
Richard Braakman</a>. No more package uploads will be accepted except those
essential to the boot floppies and CD image creation. Richard earlier removed
a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0005/msg00012.html">
bunch of packages</a> with release critical bugs. Of the 80 or
so RC bugs that remain, Richard says "<i>I hope that we can simply
ignore most of them.  At this point I don't mind releasing potato with
a handful of broken packages, if they are not overly popular ones.
The test period will show which of the bugs are truly critical.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>The last announced security fix in Debian was in March.</b> We have fixed
lots of security holes since then, so why haven't they been announced? There
are <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg01889.html">several
reasons</a>, according to Wichert Akkerman. Debian's security team needs to
find a few more people they can trust to add to the team. Also, a lot of the
recent security holes have affected packages that are not in stable, and the
security team does not issue advisories about problems that only exist in
frozen and unstable. However, it also looks like significant numbers of
security holes have
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg01856.html">slipped
through the cracks</a>, and their fixes have not been backported to stable.
One hopes that the security team can improve this track record. If you fix a
security hole in a package, please be sure to let the security team know, so
they can follow up on it.
</p>

<p>
With that said, <b>security fixes in frozen this week</b> include a remote
shell exploit in <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/64649">qpopper</a>, an
archiver security problem in <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/64841">mailman</a>,
a SSL certificate security problem in <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/64650">
netscape</a>, and two denial of services fixes in <a href="mail#mail1">X</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>And speaking of X</b>, Branden Robinson
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg01828.html">
explained</a> why he has no plans to make .debs for X 4.0.0. He cited
instability problems, lack of support for the sparc architecture, and lots
of fixes upstream. "<i>Over two hundred distinct patches have been applied to
the upstream CVS tree to date.</i>" Branden hopes to instead package X 4.0.1
when it is released in mid-June.

<p>
<b>Another Debian-based distribution has appeared.</b>
<a href="http://timesys.com/products/linux.html">TimeSys</a> is a distribution
targeted at hard real time applications. Read more in
<a href="http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/story?id=3922f93b0">this Upside
article</a>. Judging by
<a href="http://www.timesys.com/products/linuxoptions.html">this page</a>,
the actual distribution seems to be a fairly standard Debian plus some
additional "<i>TimeSys Linux/RT modules</i>".
