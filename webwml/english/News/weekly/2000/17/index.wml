<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
Right on schedule, a bunch of packages with release critical bugs were
removed from potato. (20000526183342.A10120@xs4all.nl) However, the start
of the next Test Cycle has been delayed a day or two until a fixed set of X
packages can get in. (20000529230322.A9838@xs4all.nl)
</p>

(Mention my security threads, in paricular link to Wichert's message on the
second thread.)

<p>
Branden Robinson explained (20000527205235.B27528@ecn.purdue.edu) why he
has no plans to make .debs for X 4.0.0. He cited instability problems, lack
of support for the Sparc architecture, and lots of fixes upstream. 
"<i>Over two hundred distinct patches have been applied to the upstream CVS
tree to date.</i>" Brandon hopes to instead package X 4.0.1 when it is
released in mid-June.

Another Debian-based distribution has appeared. 
<a href="http://timesys.com/products/linux.html">TimeSys</a> is a distribution
targeted at hard real time applications. Read more in
<a href="http://www.upside.com/texis/mvm/story?id=3922f93b0">this Upside
article</a>. Judging by
<a href="http://www.timesys.com/products/linuxoptions.html">this page</a>,
the actual distribution seems to be a fairly standard Debian plus some
additional "<i>TimeSys Linux/RT modules</i>".
