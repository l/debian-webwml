<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Release watch:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>The boot floppies are up to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0004/msg00565.html">version
2.2.12</a>, and are progressing nicely. This version has the distinction of
being the first "<i>really fully functional powerpc installer</i>" for Debian,
a very important milestone for the powerpc port.
<li>The number of <a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release
critical bugs</a> continues to hover around 125.
</ul>

<p>
<b>The First European Debian Meeting</b> is
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0004/msg00005.html">
planned</a> to be held starting July 5th in France as part of the Libre
Software Meeting. This has generated some enthusiasm among the
French developers, but it may have some scheduling conflicts with other
events in Europe. It's yet to be seen how big this gathering will be.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some impressive graphs have been made</b> of the relations
(dependencies, conflicts, etc) between various packages.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg01032.html">These
graphs</a> can give some idea of the complexities apt has to deal with.
The graph of all the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/dcg/base.ps.gz">packages in the base
system</a> is especially interesting.
</p>

<p>
Perl folks will be happy to know that <b>experimental perl 5.6 debs</b> are
<a href="mail#1">available</a> for woody. Hopefully fully integrating this new
version won't be as complex as the last perl upgrade since a lot of groundwork
was laid last time to support future upgrades.
</p>

<p>
