<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Chris Frey
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0003/msg01283.html">pointed
out </a> that we are vunerable to man-in-the-middle attacks during upgrades,
because packages can be compromized on Debian mirrors and no checking is done
before they are installed. He suggested that the Packages file be
automatically signed on master to prevent this. This led to a long and
typically inconclusive discussion between two sets of people: Those who think
this is a good idea (20000401125553.B25544@azure.humbug.org.au)
which can be easily implemented and will add some security to the system,
and those who think it is worthless since it still does not lead to an
absolutly secure system. (20000401160020.E309@ulysses.dhis.net)
</p>

<p>
While all that discussion is surely interesting, let us not lose sight of
one very important fact: <b>The methods Debian uses to distribute packages
are currently known to be insecure and vunerable to a variety of attacks.</b>
This <a href="../../1999/24/#signdebs">has been discussed before</a> a year
ago, and nothing was done because the discussion was inconclusive. That is
not a good way to deal with a known security hole. Something should be
done, and soon (20000401035112.A30466@foursquare.net).

5 new mailing lists have been created, for purposes ranging from porting to
the PA-RISC and S/390 to Dutch internationalization.

Direct access to the Incoming directory is now available at
<a href="http://incoming.debian.org/">http://incoming.debian.org/</a>. The
old Incoming mirror network is being shut down.
