<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
For a <a href="../../1999/24/#signdebs">long time</a> everyone has been aware
of a <b>basic security problem in Debian</b>: packages can be changed on
Debian mirrors and users have no way to verify that the package they download
is the same package a developer uploaded. Two ideas have come up again and
again as ways to make this more secure. The first idea is to allow for
signatures inside the .deb files themselves, which lets one verify that a
given developer built a package. The second is to allow for signed Packages.gz
files, which lets one verify that the package went through the normal
upload process. Neither of these signatures will provide perfect security.
There are many holes left; for example, a developer's computer may be
cracked and if they do not manage their keys wisely, their key may be
compromised. In the past, in typical Debian fashion, we have held off doing
anything since there was no known perfect solution.

<p>
This issue has 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0003/msg01283.html">
resurfaced</a> this week, and there is a growing inclintation to implement
both types of signatures, realizing that they are both imperfect, to allow the
security bar to at least be raised a bit higher. After some long discussions
(20000401160020.E309@ulysses.dhis.net) on the mailing lists 
(20000403221627.A308@ulysses.dhis.net) and on irc
(20000404185957.A12147@azure.humbug.org.au), more and more people are reaching
consensus on this.

5 new mailing lists have been created, for purposes ranging from porting to
the PA-RISC and S/390 to Dutch internationalization.
