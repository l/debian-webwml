<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition; the editor was on vacation
last week.
</p>

<p>
A huge discussion and flamewar erupted this week, when John Goerzen made a
controversial proposal (87d7lu2n9d.fsf@complete.org) in the form of a
general resolution to remove non-free from the Debian archive in woody. This has
resulted in 900+ messages arguing about the idea, about 1/3 of the total
Debian list mail volume for the past week. (Not to mention the
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/09/1217220&mode=nested">
Slashdot article</a>.) Many arguments have been made on
both sides, too many to summarize here. One central disagreement
(87hfb3kmu4.fsf@ariel.i-did-not-set--mail-host-address--so-shoot-me)
that seems
to exist between those for and against the proposal concerns the purpose of
Debian itself. Does Debian exist to promote free software, or to make the
best distribution possible, or both? Which is more important? In the end it
looks like each developer will have to decide this question on their own. 
Enough people have seconded the proposal that it will become a general
resolution and be voted on in a few weeks.
** Should probably mention AJ's compromise proposal and David Welton's
tricky idea to make a "hit list" **

Before the new-maintainer process was closed last year, weekly reports
were made on new developers entering the project. With the reopening of the
new-maintainer process, these reports are restarting, beginning with this
summary (87u2feb15u.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) of the first 10 new developers
and then this one (8766rl835p.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) with 7 more.
Some <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">sixty other people</a> are working
their way through the new maintainer process.

The Zeroth Debian Conference 20000525100924.B208@polynum.com will be held
in Bordeaux, France from July 5-9, 2000. Program topics will include the HURD,
package pools, quality assurance, etc. There is more information available
from the <a href="http://lsm.abul.org/lsm_en.html">Libre Software
Meeting</a>
web page, including instructions for registration and schedule/accomodation
information.

Lots of security holes have been dealt with in the past two weeks:
Several recent security-related announcements:
<ul>
<li>A buffer overflow was reported (39396616.60D82C71@worlddomination.nu)
on the
splitvt package. It was quickly
<a href="../../../..//Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00010.html">
fixed</a> by the security team
<li>A local buffer overflow in mailx has been 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00008.html">
corrected</a>.
<li>Majordomo has been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00007.html">
removed</a> due to a security hole and license issues. 
"<i>If you are using majordomo we recommend that you replace it with one
of the many other mailing-list tools available</i>"
<li>Mh was also vulnerable to <a href="../../../../security/2000/20000229">
a remote exploit first discovered in nmh</a>. This has now been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg02069.html">fixed</a>.
<li>Kernel security holes
</ul>
