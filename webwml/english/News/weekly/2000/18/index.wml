<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition; the editor was on vacation
last week.
</p>

<p>
A huge discussion and flamewar erupted this week, when John Goerzen made a
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg00215.html">
controversial proposal</a> to remove non-free from the Debian archive in
woody. This has resulted in about 1000 messages arguing about the idea,
about 1/3 of the total Debian list mail volume for the past week. (Not to
mention the 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/09/1217220&mode=nested">
Slashdot article</a>.) Many arguments have been made on both sides, too many
to summarize here. A few compromises have also been proposed; one involves 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-project-0006/msg00065.html">
reorganizing the archive</a> to make it more clear that non-free is not
part of Debian, and another proposes
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-project-0006/msg00059.html">using
installer packages</a> for all non-free software.
</p>

<p>
One central disagreement that seems to exist between those
for and against the proposal concerns the purpose of Debian itself. Does
Debian exist to <a href="../../../../debian-project-0006/msg00128.html">
promote free software</a>, or to
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0006/msg00886.html">make the
best distribution possible</a>, or both? Which is more important? In the end
it looks like each developer will have to decide this question on their own.
Enough people have seconded the proposal that it will become a general
resolution and be voted on in a few weeks. Let's just hope that whatever is
decided, this conflict does not

Before the new-maintainer process was closed last year, weekly reports
were made on new developers entering the project. With the reopening of the
new-maintainer process, these reports are restarting, beginning with this
summary (87u2feb15u.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) of the first 10 new developers
and then this one (8766rl835p.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) with 7 more.
Some <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">sixty other people</a> are working
their way through the new maintainer process.

<p>
The <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg01643.html">
Zeroth Debian Conference</a> will be held in Bordeaux, France from July 5-9,
2000. Program topics will include the HURD, package pools, quality assurance,
etc. There is more information available from the
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/lsm_en.html">Libre Software Meeting</a>
web page, including instructions for registration and schedule/accomodation
information.

Lots of security holes have been dealt with in the past two weeks:
<ul>
<li>A buffer overflow in splitvt has been 
<a href="../../../..//Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00010.html">
fixed</a> by the security team.
<li>A local buffer overflow in mailx has been 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00008.html">
corrected</a>.
<li>Majordomo has been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00007.html">
removed</a> due to a security hole and license issues. 
"<i>If you are using majordomo we recommend that you replace it with one
of the many other mailing-list tools available</i>"
<li>Mh was also vulnerable to <a href="../../../../security/2000/20000229">
a remote exploit first discovered in nmh</a>. This has now been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg02069.html">fixed</a>.
<li>Kernel security holes (*** are they ALL fixed in our 2.2.15? ***)
</ul>
</p>

<p>
There was a thread this week about the static users and groups that exist
on every Debian system. These arn't very well documented, and hopefully
this will lead toward some complete documentation abvout what ever user and
group is meant to be used for. (E12xauD-0001aM-00@q.bofh.de)
