<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition; the editor was on vacation
last week.
</p>

<p>
<b>A huge discussion and flamewar</b> erupted when John Goerzen made a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg00215.html">
controversial proposal</a> to remove non-free from the Debian archive in
woody. This has resulted in about 1000 messages arguing about the proposal,
about 1/3 of the total Debian list mail volume for the past week. (There
was also a
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/09/1217220&amp;mode=nested">
Slashdot article</a> and a
<a href="http://slashdot.org/pollBooth.pl?qid=debiannonfree">poll</a>.) Many
arguments have been made on both sides, too many to summarize here.
</p>

<p>
<b>One central disagreement</b> that seems to exist between those
for and against the proposal concerns the purpose of Debian itself. Does
Debian exist to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0006/msg00128.html">
promote free software</a>, or to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg00886.html">make the
best distribution possible</a>, or both? Which is more important? In the end
it looks like each developer will have to decide on his or her
own. Enough people have seconded the proposal that it will become a general
resolution and be voted on in a few weeks. A few
compromises have also been proposed; one involves
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0006/msg00065.html">
reorganizing the archive</a> to make it more clear that non-free is not
part of Debian, and another proposes
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0006/msg00059.html">using
installer packages</a> for all non-free software.
</p>

<p>
<b>Work on the release has continued despite this hullabaloo.</b> CD images for
the second test cycle are <a href="mail#1">now available</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lots of security holes</b> have been dealt with since the last edition
of Debian Weekly News:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A buffer overflow in splitvt was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00010.html">
fixed</a> by the security team.
<li>A local buffer overflow in mailx was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00008.html">
corrected</a>.
<li>Majordomo was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00007.html">
removed</a> due to a security hole and license issues.
"<i>If you are using majordomo we recommend that you replace it with one
of the many other mailing-list tools available</i>"
<li>Mh was also vulnerable to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg02069.html">a remote
exploit first discovered in nmh</a>. This has been
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20000229">fixed</a>.
<li>A fix for the capabilities-related local root compromise in kernel
2.2.15 was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0006/msg00224.html">
backported</a> into the Debian package of kernel 2.2.15.
</ul>

<p>
<b>One more update to the new-maintainer saga:</b>
Before the new-maintainer process was closed last year, weekly reports
were made on new developers entering the project. With the reopening of the
new-maintainer process, these reports are restarting, beginning with this
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0005/msg00014.html">
list</a> of 10 new Debian developers and then this
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00002.html">
list</a> of 7 more.
Some <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">sixty other people</a> are working
their way through the new maintainer process. Future announcement of new
developers will be posted weekly to debian-project.
</p>

<p>
<b>The <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg01643.html">
Zeroth Debian Conference</a></b> will be held in Bordeaux, France from July 5-9,
2000. Program topics will include the HURD, package pools, quality
assurance, etc. There is more information available from the
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/lsm_en.html">Libre Software Meeting</a>
web page, including instructions for registration and
schedule/accommodation information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Wrapping up</b>, here are some other things that have been happening
lately:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg00025.html">A
discussion</a> about the static users and groups that exist
on every Debian system. These aren't very well documented, and hopefully
this will lead toward some complete documentation about what every user and
group is meant to be used for.
<li>Wichert Akkerman has written
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0006/msg00015.html">
statoverride</a>, a replacement for suidmanager that is better integrated
with dpkg and fixes some problems of suidmanager.
<li>The <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/survey/">netcraft survey</a> reports
that 9% of the linux web servers they surveyed ran Debian and Apache.
72% run Red Hat.
<li>The old tired story of KDE and Debian has surfaced again, this time with a
twist:
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=00/06/06/135218&amp;mode=nested">
$3000 has been offered to KDE</a> if they amend their license with a short
clause to make it suitable for inclusion in Debian.
</ul>
