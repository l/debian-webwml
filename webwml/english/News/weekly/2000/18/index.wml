Before the new-maintainer process was closed last year, weekly reports
were made on new developers entering the project. With the reopening of the
new-maintainer process, these reports are restarting, beginning with this
summary (87u2feb15u.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) of the first 10 new developers.
Some <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">seventy other people</a> are working
their way through the new maintainer process.
