<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman posted (20000415174155.A997@mors.wiggy.net) a list of
changes to dpkg that will happen in woody. Some of these changes including
using objdump instead of ldd and file reordinging when a package is built,
are already in CVS, while others like integrating suidmanager and debconf,
and supporting signed packages are just planned to be implemented in time
for woody's release. Many of the listed items are things that have long
been missing from dpkg; it's great to see work progressing on Debian's
fundamental program.
</p>

<p>
The pointless thread of the week award goes to this thread
(20000417030712.C28642@gaia.pp.sci.fi) about including the constitution of
Finland in Debian. So far it has been mostly a rehash of 
<a href="../1999/3/#data">previous threads</a> about inclusion of non-program
data in Debian, and the conclusion is mostly the same: such things should
go in a special "data" section which doesn't yet exist.
</p>

<p>
