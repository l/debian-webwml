<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The testing of the new maintainer process is in full swing!</b> For the
first time in nearly a year, 
<a href="http://cipsa.physik.uni-freiburg.de/pipermail/nm-discuss/2000-April/000303.html">
new blood is entering the Debian project</a>. The lucky first person through
the new new-maintainer process is Brendan O'Dea. Brendan and others who are
finishing up their applications went through the process in a trial run to
work any bugs out of the new system, which is not yet open to all comers.
Those persons who had pending applications when new maintainer closed are due
to be processed next, and the process will open to the public as soon as a web
page interface is complete.
</p>

<p>
<b>Richard Braakman would like to start the first test cycle</b>
<a href="mail#1">in 2 weeks</a>, on May 2nd. "<i>After a
fixed-length testing period we will evaluate the results and decide whether
or not to release what we have.</i>" If we did release after only one test
cycle, that would mean releasing in about one month. On the other hand,
multiple test cycles may be required..
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman <a href="mail#2">posted</a> a list of <b>changes to dpkg that
are planned for woody</b>. Some of these changes, including using objdump
instead of ldd and doing file reordering when a package is built, are already
in CVS; while others, like integrating suidmanager and debconf and supporting
signed packages, are just planned to be implemented in time for woody's
release. Many of the listed items are things that have long been missing from
dpkg; it's great to see work progressing on Debian's fundamental program.
</p>

<p>
Wichert also <a href="mail#3">posted</a> about the <b>sad state
of documentation registration in Debian</b>. We have multiple competing
systems for registering documentation, and so there is no central registry
that lists all documentation. Wichert proposed a new system that is similar
to doc-base but borrows ideas from the menu package. Adam Di Carlo pointed
out that he has <a href="http://www.debian.org/~aph/debian-metadata.html/">
similar changes</a> planned for the next release of doc-base.
