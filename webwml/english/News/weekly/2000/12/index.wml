<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Richard Braakman would like to start the first test cycle
(20000418134746.A2469@xs4all.nl) in 2 weeks, on May 2nd. "<i>After a
fixed-length testing period we will evaluate the results and decide whether
or not to release what we have.</i>" If we did release after only one test
cycle, that would mean releasing in about one month. On the other hand,
multiple test cycles could be required..
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman posted (20000415174155.A997@mors.wiggy.net) a list of
changes to dpkg that will happen in woody. Some of these changes including
using objdump instead of ldd and file reordinging when a package is built,
are already in CVS, while others like integrating suidmanager and debconf,
and supporting signed packages are just planned to be implemented in time
for woody's release. Many of the listed items are things that have long
been missing from dpkg; it's great to see work progressing on Debian's
fundamental program.
</p>

<p>
Wichert also posted (20000415205045.A3175@mors.wiggy.net) about the sad state
of documentation registration in Debian. We have multiple competing systems for
registering documentation, and so there is no central registry that lists all
documentation. Wichert proposed a new system that is similar to doc-base
but borrows ideas from the menu package. Adam Di Carlo pointed out that he has
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~aph/debian-metadata.html/">similar changes</a>
planned for the next release of doc-base.
</p>

<p>
The pointless thread of the week award goes to this thread
(20000417030712.C28642@gaia.pp.sci.fi) about including the constitution of
Finland in Debian. So far it has been mostly a rehash of 
<a href="../1999/3/#data">previous threads</a> about inclusion of non-program
data in Debian, and the conclusion is mostly the same: such things should
go in a special "data" section which doesn't yet exist.
</p>

<p>
Other discussions this week included installing Debian from floppies
(20000411161545.A29403@cibalia.gkvk.hr), fixing package priorities
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1000412201403.8090A-100000@cantor.unex.es)
</p>
