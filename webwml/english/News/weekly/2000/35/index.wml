<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian has package pools!</b> James Troup
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0010/msg00007.html">
revealed</a> that "<i>for the last month and a half, I've been working on
re-implementing dinstall and switching to package pools.</i>" His message 
gives details about how regular users, developers, and mirror admins will be
affected (not much, not much, and a great deal), the new layout of the 
Debian archive, the database backend, the migration strategy ("<i>an 
as-of-yet-unwritten tool will migrated n Mb of data a day into the pool from 
the legacy dists/ tree</i>"), and the timeline before this is put in place on
the Debian archive (about two weeks).
</p>

<p>
<b>A beta version of the LSB-FHS test suite was run against several major
distributions including Debian woody, which failed 17 tests out of 243.</b> A
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/">chart</a> shows that other
distributions failed many more, while SuSE only failed 5. The
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/Detailed_Debian_Woody.html">
detailed report</a> of Debian's failures is interesting reading. After
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01440.html">examining
each failure</a>, Wichert Akkerman commented,
"<i>Not all of the test results are fair in my opinion: some are real
bugs in Debian, others are bugs in the testsuite or the result of
using an incomplete install.</i>" Some were really bugs in the test suite, 
a few were things that should 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01731.html">not be in
the FHS</a>, and 6 of the 9 remaining failures "<i>can be fixed by simply 
creating empty directories</i>" Since FHS editor Daniel Quinlan and the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01490.html">author of 
the test suite</a> are involved in the discussion, it appears that all of 
these things will be eventually worked out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Why isn't Helix Gnome in Debian yet?</b> For a while now there has been
duplication of effort, with Peter Teichman of Helix maintaining an apt
repository of Helix Gnome packages, and other Debian developers    
maintaining regular Gnome in Debian. The only real reason for this
duplication of work is that Peter thinks that there might be
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01462.html">copyright 
problems with some of the images</a> in Helix Gnome, but he's not sure, 
and for whatever reason this question has been unresolved for some time now. 
Meanwhile, some folks 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01432.html">feel that</a>
"<i>the woody packages aren't BAD, but
after using Helix, going back feels like a serious downgrade</i>", and
others <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01438.html">have
found</a> that the Helix packages "<i>do not have the same quality
when it comes to dependencies and such</i>". A subthread      
that tried to list the differences between the two sets of packages found
very little of note besides Helix's branding. Whatever the differences,
many people are using the Helix debs, and bothering Debian developers with
things like <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/75244">this bug report</a>.
This situation really needs to be resolved before it has a chance to turn
ugly.

<p>
<b>Debian's newest server is <tt>klecker.debian.org</tt></b>, which is now
serving as Debian's 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01678.html">main web
server</a>. Of course, it's named after Joel "Espy" Klecker. Unfortunately,
many home directories from the old <tt>va.debian.org</tt> machine, which 
suffered a disk failure, have still not been recovered and may be 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01701.html">gone for
good</a>. A new hostname, <tt>people.debian.org</tt> has also been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01706.html">set up</a>,
"<i>which will exclusively be used for individual web pages</i>". Developers
with personal Debian web pages should begin using URLs based on the new
domain name.

<p>

<b>More and more Debian news sources are appearing.</b> The latest
arrival is <a href="http://www.debianplanet.org/">Debian Planet</a>, a
web site providing Debian news in a weblog format. In the meantime,
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/latest.epl">Kernel Cousin Debian</a>
is up to their 7th issue, but still needs more contributors.
