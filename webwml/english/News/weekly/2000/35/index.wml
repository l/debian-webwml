<b>Debian has package pools!</b> James Troup revealed
(87k8b54s8q.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) that "<i>for the last month and a 
half, I've been working on re-implementing dinstall and switching to
package pools.</i>" His message gives details about how regular users,
developers, and mirror admins will be affected (not much, not much, and a
great deal), the new layout of the Debian archive, the database backend,
the migration strategy ("<i>an as-of-yet-unwritten tool will
migrated n Mb of data a day into the pool from the legacy dists/
tree</i>"), and the timeline before this is put in place on the Debian
archive (about two weeks).
