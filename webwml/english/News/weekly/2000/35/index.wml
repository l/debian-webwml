<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

<p>
<b>Debian has package pools!</b> James Troup revealed
(87k8b54s8q.fsf@dt-jtlaptop.datatrans) that "<i>for the last month and a 
half, I've been working on re-implementing dinstall and switching to
package pools.</i>" His message gives details about how regular users,
developers, and mirror admins will be affected (not much, not much, and a
great deal), the new layout of the Debian archive, the database backend,
the migration strategy ("<i>an as-of-yet-unwritten tool will
migrated n Mb of data a day into the pool from the legacy dists/
tree</i>"), and the timeline before this is put in place on the Debian
archive (about two weeks).

Debian and the FHS. The LSB-FHS test suite was ran against several major
distributions including Debian woody, which failed 17 tests out of 243. A 
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/">chart</a> shows that other
distributions failed many more, while SuSE only failed 5. The 
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/Detailed_Debian_Woody.html">
detailed report</a> of Debian's failures is interesting reading. Wichert
Akkerman commented (** head of "Comments on FHS testsuite run" **),
"<i>Not all of the test results are fair in my opinion: some are real
bugs in Debian, others are bugs in the testsuite or the result of
using an incomplete install.</i>" He also looked at each failure in turn -- 
some were really bugs in the test suite, a few were things that should
not be in the LSB, and 6 of the 9 remaining failures "<i>can be fixed by
simply creating empty directories</i>"
