<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian has package pools!</b> James Troup
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0010/msg00007.html">
revealed</a> that "<i>for the last month and a half, I've been working on
re-implementing dinstall and switching to package pools.</i>" His message 
gives details about how regular users, developers, and mirror admins will be
affected (not much, not much, and a great deal), the new layout of the 
Debian archive, the database backend, the migration strategy ("<i>an 
as-of-yet-unwritten tool will migrated n Mb of data a day into the pool from 
the legacy dists/ tree</i>"), and the timeline before this is put in place on
the Debian archive (about two weeks).
</p>

<p>
<b>The beta LSB-FHS test suite was ran against several major
distributions including Debian woody, which failed 17 tests out of 243.</b> A
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/">chart</a> shows that other
distributions failed many more, while SuSE only failed 5. The
<a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/results/Detailed_Debian_Woody.html">
detailed report</a> of Debian's failures is interesting reading. After
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01440.html">examining
each failure</a>, Wichert Akkerman commented,
"<i>Not all of the test results are fair in my opinion: some are real
bugs in Debian, others are bugs in the testsuite or the result of
using an incomplete install.</i>" Some were really bugs in the test suite, 
a few were things that should 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01731.html">not be in
the FHS</a>, and 6 of the 9 remaining failures "<i>can be fixed by simply 
creating empty directories</i>" Since FHS editor Daniel Quinlan and the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01490.html">author of 
the test suite</a> are involved in the discussion, it appears that all of 
these things will be eventually worked out.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian's newest server is <tt>klecker.debian.org</tt></b>, which is now
serving as Debian's 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01678.html:">main web
server</a>. Of course, it's named after Joel "Espy" Klecker. Unfortunatly,
many home directories from the old <tt>va.debian.org</tt> machine, which 
suffered a disk failure, have still not been recovered and may be 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01701.html">gone for
good</a>. A new hostname, <tt>people.debian.org</tt> has also been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0010/msg01706.html">set up</a>,
"<i>which will exclusively be used for individual web pages</i>". Developers
with personal Debian web pages should begin using URLs based on the new
domain name.
</p>

<p>
<b>More and more Debian news sources are appearing.</b> The latest
arrival is <a href="http://www.debianplanet.org/">Debian Planet</a>, a
web site providing Debian news in a weblog format. In the meantime,
<a href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/debian/latest.epl">Kernel Cousin Debian</a>
is up to their 7th issue, but still needs more contributors.
