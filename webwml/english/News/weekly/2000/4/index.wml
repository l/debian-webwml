#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="January 25th, 2000" SUMMARY="DPL elections; boot floppies progress"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. DWN will probably not be published next week.
</p>

<p>
It's time for nominations for who will be the next Debian Project Leader.
Nominations will 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00016.html">
close in one week</a>. So far two people have nominated themselves: 
<a href="mail#1">Ben Collins</a> and current DPL <a href="mail#2">Wichert
Akkerman</a>.
</p>

<p>
A new version of the boot floppies has been released. (*** Hasn't yet ***)
New features include DHCP support, network installs via the HTTP protocol,
a "compact" kernel flavor that requires fewer disks to install, and a new
simplified package selection that uses task packages and avoids dselect
entirely.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000120-000004.html">The
Register</a>, Transmeta's "Mobile Linux" is based on the Debian
distribution. Mobile Linux is shipped with Transmeta's TM3120 chip. Transmeta
has not yet confirmed this.
</p>

<p>
Believe it or not, another KDE licencing discussion has erupted on
debian-devel. It started with a simple question: Why is KDE not in Debian?
Haven't the licence issues been dealt with by the new Open Source Qt, and
other changes? Well according to Joseph Carter, there are 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0001/msg01074.html">still
problems</a>. KDE is mostly licenced under the GPL, which is still not
compatabile with the QPL, unless the author gives explicit permission for his
GPL'd code to be linked with Qt. For large parts of KDE, of course, that
should be no problem -- people affiliated with the KDE project wrote it and
should be able to give this permission. But, there are still parts of KDE 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0001/msg01113.html">such as
kghostview</a> which are copyright by others. In any case, such permission has
never been given, and so Debian continues to be unable to distribute KDE. Raul
Miller <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-legal-0001/msg00095.html">
summed it up</a>: "<i>If the KDE folks would make a reasonably solid statement
of permission, we could probably distribute most of KDE. In the mean time, we
wait.</i>"
