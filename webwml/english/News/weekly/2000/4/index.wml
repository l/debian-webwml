<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000120-000004.html">The
Register</a>, Transmeta's "Mobile Linux" is based on the Debian
distribution. Mobile Linux is being shipped with Transmeta's TM3120 chip.
The article goes on to say that "<i>not only is this a vote of confidence in
Debian - it's as near to being sanctified as a distro can get - but it might
close the gap between the high technical regard in which Debian is held, and
the general punters? ignorance of its existence. And isn't it touching that
the blessing should go to the only distribution which is incapable of making
its authors obnoxious, millionaired IPO'd superbrats? Debian is a collective
organisation, not a private company. Don't even bother looking for the
ticker.</i>" (****TRIM??****)

There is no doubt that Debian is frozen: Master experienced disk problems
this week. (20000121164318.A4238@aeon.dhis.net) (** Elaborate for the
newbies, and make sure it was really disk problems; Culus thinks not.. Ah,
add Pine.LNX.3.96.1000120215040.2962F-100000@wakko.deltatee.com to this --
DWN crashed master angle.. **)

Believe it or not, another KDE licencing discussion has erupted on
debian-devel. It started with a simple question: Why is KDE not in Debian?
Haven't the licence issues been dealt with by the new Open Source Qt, and
other changes? Well according to Joseph Carter, there are still problems
(20000119192423.E15478@debian.org). Parts of KDE are still licenced under
the GPL, which is still not compatabile with the QPL, unless the
author gives permission for his GPL'd code to be linked with Qt. For large
parts of KDE, of course, that should be no problem -- people affiliated with 
the KDE project wrote it and should be able to give this permission. But, there
are still parts of KDE such as kghostview
(20000120153737.A25628@x8b4e53cd.dhcp.okstate.edu) which are GPL'd and not
under the control of KDE. In any case, such permission has never been given,
and so Debian continues to be unable to distribute KDE. Raul Miller summed
it up (20000120191141.A5687@usatoday.com): "<i>If the KDE folks would make a
reasonably solid statement of permission, we could probably distribute most
of KDE. In the mean time, we wait.</i>"
