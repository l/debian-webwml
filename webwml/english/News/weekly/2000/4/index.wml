<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two week edition.
</p>

<p>
<b>Project Leader elections start soon.</b> Nominations for Project Leader
were open for 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00016.html">
quite a while</a> before anyone dared to volunteer for the job, but 4
candidates eventually stepped forward: 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-vote-0001/msg00000.html">Ben
Collins</a>,
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-vote-0001/msg00002.html">Joel
Klecker</a>, 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-vote-0001/msg00008.html">Matthew
Vernon</a>, and current DPL
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-vote-0001/msg00001.html">Wichert
Akkerman</a>. The candidates will probably
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-vote-0001/msg00012.html">debate on
IRC</a> sometime next week.
</p>

<p>
<b>We will soon enter the first test cycle for potato.</b> In preparation for
that, Richard Braakman
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00022.html">
removed 42 packages</a> from potato that have release critical bugs and are
not terribly important to Debian as a whole. Richard also 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00023.html">
listed</a> the 5 packages the "<i>most likely to delay the release</i>" --
packages that have release critical bugs but cannot just be removed.
Unsurprisingly, these actions prompted a good deal of work, and some griping
about the packages that were removed.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new version of the boot floppies</b> has been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-release-0001/msg00078.html">
released</a>. New features include DHCP support, network installs via
the HTTP protocol, a "compact" kernel flavor that requires fewer disks
to install, and a new simplified package selection that uses task packages
and avoids dselect entirely. This release of boot floppies was done
"<i>specifically to enable a release/test cycle</i>", so if you're able,
test it and send in bug reports.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000120-000004.html">The
Register</a>, <b>Transmeta's "Mobile Linux" is based on the Debian
distribution</b>. Mobile Linux is shipped with Transmeta's TM3120 chip.
Transmeta has not yet confirmed this.
</p>

<p>
<b>Believe it or not, another KDE licensing discussion has erupted on
debian-devel.</b> It started with a simple question: Why is KDE not in Debian?
Haven't the license issues been dealt with by the new Open Source Qt, and
other changes? Well according to Joseph Carter, there are 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0001/msg01074.html">still
problems</a>. KDE is mostly licensed under the GPL, which is still not
compatible with the QPL, unless the author gives explicit permission for his
GPL'd code to be linked with Qt. For large parts of KDE, of course, that
should be no problem -- people affiliated with the KDE project wrote it and
should be able to give this permission. But, there are still parts of KDE 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0001/msg01113.html">such as
kghostview</a> which are copyright by others. In any case, such permission has
never been given, and so Debian continues to be unable to distribute KDE. Raul
Miller <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-legal-0001/msg00095.html">
summed it up</a>: "<i>If the KDE folks would make a reasonably solid statement
of permission, we could probably distribute most of KDE. In the mean time, we
wait.</i>"
