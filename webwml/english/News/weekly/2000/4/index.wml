<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
According to <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000120-000004.html">The
Register</a>, Transmeta's "Mobile Linux" is based on the Debian
distribution. Mobile Linux is being shipped with Transmeta's TM3120 chip.
The article goes on to say that "<i>not only is this a vote of confidence in
Debian - it's as near to being sanctified as a distro can get - but it might
close the gap between the high technical regard in which Debian is held, and
the general punters? ignorance of its existence. And isn't it touching that
the blessing should go to the only distribution which is incapable of making
its authors obnoxious, millionaired IPO'd superbrats? Debian is a collective
organisation, not a private company. Don't even bother looking for the
ticker.</i>" (****TRIM??****)
