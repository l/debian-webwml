<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian is frozen!</b> The freeze began 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00013.html">
right on schedule</a>, and we hope it lasts only about two months.
Developers who don't remember how to upload bugfixes during the freeze, or who
weren't around last time should read 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0001/msg00011.html">
this mail</a> that explains the procedure.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Linux Show gave Debian two awards for "<i>Best Linux Distro</i>".</b>
Debian will receive <a href="http://www.thelinuxshow.com/best.shtml">the
awards</a> at LinuxWorld. With more awards rolling in at each LinuxWorld,
perhaps Debian should invest in a trophy case? <b>Speaking of LinuxWorld</b>,
Debian will have a booth there, which is being coordinated on 
<a href="http://benham.net/mailman/listinfo/lwe-ny">this mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Three different types of Debian shirts are available now</b> 
<a href="../../oldurl?http://copyleft.net/groups/debian.html">at Copyleft</a>.
A donation to Debian is included in each order.
</p>

<p>
<b>Despite the freeze, work on the boot floppies and related installation
issues goes on.</b> One thing that was almost put off until too late was
creating all the task packages that users will choose from when installing
potato for the first time. Many of the planned task packages were not ready
in time, and several still
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0001/msg00737.html">need
maintainers</a>. Luckily, these task packages are very simple and unlikely to
break things, and so they are being allowed in despite the freeze, along
with a very few other <b>new packages</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>kernel-source-2.2.14</b>: Linux kernel source for 2.2.14
<li><b>task-database-pg</b>: PostgreSQL database
<li><b>task-imap</b>: IMAP Server task package
<li><b>task-python</b>: Python script development environment task package
<li><b>task-python-bundle</b>: Full distribution of Python 
<li><b>task-python-dev</b>: Full Python development environment
<li><b>task-python-web</b>: Python web application development environment
<li><b>task-x-window-system-core</b>: X Window System (core components)
</ul>
<p>
Here is a neat

graph</a> of the number of packages in Incoming.
