<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian is frozen!<b> The freeze began right on schedule
(20000116171901.A1675@xs4all.nl), and we hope it lasts only about two months.
Developers who don't remember how to upload bugfixes during the freeze, or who
weren't around last time should read this mail (20000114214019.A1031@xs4all.nl)
that explains the procedure.
</p>

<p>
The Linux Show awarded Debian two awards for "</i>Best Linux Distro</i>", from
both the Editors and Listeners. (http://www.thelinuxshow.com/best.shtml)
Debian will receive the awards at LinuxWorld. With so many awards rolling
in, perhaps Debian should invest in a trophy case?
</p>

<p>
Three different types of Debian shirts are available now at Copyleft
(http://copyleft.net/groups/debian.html). A donation to Debian is included
in each order.
</p>

** This week's good review: http://www.thelinuxgurus.org/gnudebian.html 
(should probably add caveat that this is a review of the boxed set and I
work at VA) **
