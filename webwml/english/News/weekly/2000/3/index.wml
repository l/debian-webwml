<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian is frozen!<b> The freeze began right on schedule
(20000116171901.A1675@xs4all.nl), and we hope it lasts only about two months.
Developers who don't remember how to upload bugfixes during the freeze, or who
weren't around last time should read this mail (20000114214019.A1031@xs4all.nl)
that explains the procedure.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Linux Show gave Debian two awards for "</i>Best Linux Distro</i>"</b>.
Debian will receive <a href="http://www.thelinuxshow.com/best.shtml">the awards
at LinuxWorld. With more awards rolling in at each LinuxWorld, perhaps Debian
should invest in a trophy case? Speaking of LinuxWorld, Debian will have a
booth there, which is being coordinated on 
<a href="http://benham.net/mailman/listinfo/lwe-ny">this mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Three different types of Debian shirts are available now</b> 
<a href="http://copyleft.net/groups/debian.html">at Copyleft</a>.
A donation to Debian is included in each order.
</p>

<p>
Because of the freeze, only selected <b>new packages</b> are accepted into
potato. This week's list include the following and
