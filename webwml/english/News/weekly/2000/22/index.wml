<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer

Security fixes. A remote root exploit in the rpc.statd program fromn
nfs-common was found and fixed this week. This effects potato and woody
only, not stable, and an immediate upgrade is reccommended.

Burn All GIFs? Not quite yet (sorry, Don).
(20000712213528.A1100@priv3.onet.pl) Some discussion on debian-legal about
whether GIFs in GPL'd packages were legal. After all, if they are
compressed, how can they be modified legally by anyone? This is mostly laid
to rest with the observation that the GPL requires things licensed under it
be modifyable in its <em>source form</em>, which for a GIF is the underlying
pixmap. The GPL doesn't require that the binary form be easily editable.
