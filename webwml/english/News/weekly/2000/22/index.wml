<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Security fixes. A
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00019.html">
remote root exploit</a> in the rpc.statd program from
nfs-common was found and fixed this week. This effects potato and woody
only, not stable, and an immediate upgrade is reccommended.
A remote shell exploit
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00018.html">
in cvsweb</a> was also fixed.
</p>

<p>
The debian-policy list, which has been mostly inactive for a while, is
waking back up. A
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-policy-0007/msg00050.html">new
release of the policy manual</a> might happen sometime soon. The 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-policy-0007/msg00074.html">current
hot topic</a> is adding new fields to Debian packages, to allow use of third
party bug tracking systems, and mark the origin of a package. No-one
disputes that these things are increasingly needed as third party Debian
packages proliferate, but exactly how they should be implemented is a
matter of some debate.
</p>

<p>
Last week Debian Weekly News ran a brief notice about a proposal to remove
all libc5 support packages from unstable. The discussion was only beginning
then; now people have had a week to object to the idea. Most objectors
however, missed the fact that removing libc5 support from unstable will not
remove existing libc5 packages from their machines.
(20000711110730.O5182@visi.net) There were valid worries though. What if we
drop libc5 support and changes to the linker make the old libc5 packages
stop working entirely? (20000712110422.A9378@silly.cloud.net.au) To address
this, we might keep libc5 itself in unstable, but remove all the other
libc5 compatability libraries and development support
(20000711114311.R5182@visi.net) -- a compromise that seems to satisfy
everyone.
</p>

<p>
The libc5 discussion branched out into a more general discussion of whether
we should "<i>limit upgradability to two major releases back</i>".
(Pine.LNX.3.96.1000711181939.11484o-100000@eden.nslug.ns.ca) Recently there
have been successful upgrades from Debian 1.3 to frozen, skipping two major
releases. This is a fine accomplishment, but making it work does take a lot
of effort, and require a significant amount of cruft in the distribution.
No resolution on this one yet.

<p>
Burn All GIFs? Not quite yet (sorry, Don).
(20000712213528.A1100@priv3.onet.pl) Some discussion on debian-legal about
whether GIFs in GPL'd packages were legal. After all, if they are
compressed, how can they be modified legally by anyone? This is mostly laid
to rest with the observation that the GPL requires things licensed under it
be modifyable in its <em>source form</em>, which for a GIF is the underlying
pixmap. The GPL doesn't require that the binary form be easily editable.
(Pine.GS4.4.21.0007131207220.476-100000@erde.informatik.uni-freiburg.de)
About 22 thousand GIF files remain in the Debian distribution, about as
many as all other formats of images combined.
