<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>A quick release status update:</b> The release managers are
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0007/msg00008.html">back</a>,
and fixed packages are moving into frozen again. We have still not entered
the third test cycle.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0007/msg00913.html">Here is
a short list</a> of things that are holding it up.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes.</b> A
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00019.html">
remote root exploit</a> in the rpc.statd program from
nfs-common was found and fixed this week. This effects potato and woody
only, not stable, and an immediate upgrade is recommended.
A fix was also released for a remote shell exploit
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-00/msg00018.html">
in cvsweb</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The debian-policy list</b>, which has been mostly inactive for a while, is
waking back up. A
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0007/msg00050.html">new
release of the policy manual</a> might happen sometime soon. The 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0007/msg00074.html">current
hot topic</a> is adding new fields to Debian packages, to allow use of third
party bug tracking systems, and mark the origin of a package. Few would
dispute that such things are increasingly needed as third party Debian
packages proliferate, but exactly how they should be implemented is a
matter of some debate.
</p>

<p>
<b>Last week</b> this newsletter ran a brief notice about a proposal to
remove libc5 support packages from unstable. The discussion was only
beginning then; now people have had a week to object to the idea. Most
objections however, do not take into account the fact that removing libc5
support from unstable will not remove existing libc5 packages from their
machines, and libc5 support packages will
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0007/msg00527.html">still be
available</a> from the
<a href="ftp://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/dists/">debian archives</a>.
There were some valid worries though. What
if we drop libc5 support and then changes to the linker make the old and 
unsupported libc5 packages
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0007/msg00565.html">stop
working</a>? To address this, we might keep libc5 itself in unstable, but
remove all the other libc5 compatibility libraries and development support
-- a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0007/msg00531.html">
compromise</a> that seems to satisfy everyone.
</p>

<p>
The libc5 discussion then expanded into a more
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0007/msg00548.html">general
discussion</a> about whether we should 
"<i>limit upgradability to two major releases back</i>". Recently there
have been successful upgrades from Debian 1.3 to frozen, skipping two major
releases. This is a fine accomplishment, but making it work does take a lot
of effort, and require a significant amount of cruft in the distribution.
Would our time be better spent on improving other things? No resolution on
this one yet.
</p>
