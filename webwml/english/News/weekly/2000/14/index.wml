#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="May 3nd, 2000" SUMMARY="Beginning the first Test Cycle."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian has <a href="mail#1">entered</a> the first Test Cycle.</b>
Richard Braakman first <a href="mail#2">removed 17 packages</a>
with release critical bugs from the distribution, which has reduced the
number of release critical bugs to
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">less than 100</a>. The only
changes that will occur in potato in next 2 weeks are a final boot-floppies
update and CD image creation. Potato should be ready for testing in a few
days, once these final pieces have settled. At that point, any interested
users are encouraged to upgrade, and help 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-0004/msg00027.html">test</a>
the distribution.
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg01491.html">posted</a>
a <b>rough proposal for a new source package format</b>. Some discussion
ensued and it became clear that we don't yet have a consensus about everything
a new source format should do, or how it should work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Other discussion topics this week</b> include a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0004/msg01377.html">long
thread</a> about what to do after potato is released and about release
management and timelines in general, a <!-- add a link to the thread,
20000501211015.F4189@kitenet.net -->thread about phasing out override
files, and discussion about <a href="mail#3">Microsoft's patent</a> on
"installing and updating program module components" over the net, which we
must hope doesn't really cover anything Debian has been doing for the past
4 years.
</p>
