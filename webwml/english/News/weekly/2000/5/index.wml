<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Debian will soon begin accepting new maintainers, after a long hiatus. The
new maintainer team has been reorganized, and is now headed by Dale Scheetz.
While this is being done in private, Dale allowed Debian Weekly News to
repost the following:
<blockquote>
<i>
I think it is safe to say that we have a team of      
25 volunteers, who will be, in the next several weeks, finalizing the 
details of the new process, and setting up the web page interfaces needed 
to let prospective applicants track their progress through the process. 
Once we have a process that we all can follow (each step defined), the 
doors will be open to new applicants. At least some of those persons 
already waiting, with sponsors, will be used to test the new process. The 
remaining "waiting list" will be worked into the process before new 
applicants, and all applications will be dealt with on a first come first 
served basis. With the large number of Application Managers who 
volunteered, we should be able to take care of the backlog in short order.
