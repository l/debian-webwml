<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian will soon begin accepting new maintainers, after a long hiatus.</b>
The new maintainer team has been reorganized, and is now headed by Dale
Scheetz. While this is being done in private, Dale allowed Debian Weekly News
to repost the following:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>
we have a team of 25 volunteers, who will be, in the next several weeks,
finalizing the details of the new process, and setting up the web page
interfaces needed to let prospective applicants track their progress through
the process. Once we have a process that we all can follow (each step defined),
the doors will be open to new applicants. At least some of those persons 
already waiting, with sponsors, will be used to test the new process. The 
remaining "waiting list" will be worked into the process before new 
applicants, and all applications will be dealt with on a first come first 
served basis. With the large number of Application Managers who 
volunteered, we should be able to take care of the backlog in short order.

<b>A "Debian for Kids" project</b> is

They will work on making it easy to child-proof Debian systems, plus package
programs and games that are especially useful for kids. The thread is full
of interesting anecdotes and discussion.

<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0002/msg00091.html">This
week's flamewar</a> centered around <b>Debian's MBR</b>. Debian installs a
special MBR, which allows booting from floppy, before lilo runs. When a system
is being hardened to be secure at the console, don't forget to disable this
feature of the MBR, or a security hole will be present in the hardened system.
While most developers eventually decided this is really a

documentation problem</a>, some continue to strongly disagree with that
analysis. Things done to address the problem so far include adding a warning
about the MBR to the install process, and patching the MBR itself so it
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/56973">outputs "MBR" when it runs</a>, to clue
the admin in that something is happening.

In other security news, a <a

has been fixed in apcd.
