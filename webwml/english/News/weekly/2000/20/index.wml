<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Test Cycle 2
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0006/msg00048.html">is
over</a></b> and the archive is being
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0006/msg00012.html">
updated</a> in preparation for the next test cycle. The release manager and
others have been aggressively downgrading and fixing RC bugs, as well
as removing some packages, the result is
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">less than 40 RC bugs</a>
remain open, a record low. Of course, the big question is: Will the third
Test Cycle be the last? Only time will tell, but confidence is 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg01941.html">on the
rise</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Upgrading from 1.3 to frozen.</b>
Many <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-0006/threads.html">
install and upgrade reports</a> have been posted in the past couple of
weeks, but
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0006/msg01830.html">this
one</a> stands out. It's an upgrade from a system running Debian 1.3 all the
way to frozen in one step, and it worked fine except one small and
documented glitch.
"<i>Thanks and big kudos to all Debian: it is quite uncommon that an operating
system may upgrade like this (consider also that it passed from a libc5 to a
libc6 arch... and it took just 45 minutes)</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>This week's security fixes:</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>An 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0006/msg01023.html">
updated X</a> was installed into frozen, fixing a denial of service attack, a
symlink attack, and 4 security holes in Xlib.
<li>A remote root exploit in wu-ftpd has been
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20000623">fixed</a>. Note that 
"<i>the default  configuration in all current Debian packages prevents the
currently available exploits in the case of anonymous access, although local
users could still possibly compromise the server.</i>"
<li>A remote root exploit in dhcp-client-beta and dhcp-client has also been
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20000628">fixed</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<b>More Debian-based distributions.</b>
<a href="http://www.amirixlinux.com/">AMIRIX Linux</a> is a Debian-based
distribution aimed at the embedded Linux space. AMIRIX is the principal
sponsor of the <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Embedded Debian Project</a>,
which aims to "<i>make Debian GNU/Linux a natural choice for 
embedded Linux.</i>" "<i>This is an independent project, and is not
formally associated with Debian. We plan on working closely with Debian, with
the goal of our work eventually being integrated into the mainstream. </i>"
The project was announced to the debian-devel mailing list back in May, but
Debian Weekly News missed
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0005/msg00294.html">the
announcement</a>, which gives some background information.
</p>

<p>
<b>Freshmeat will be hosting an unofficial .deb archive</b>, called the Deb
Freshmeat Repository. The plans for this archive are to provide a
central location for unofficial packages. "<i>With the recent hubbub over
KDE/QPL, the talk of removal of non-free, multiple .deb using distributions
and the multitude of unofficial aptable and non-aptable sites with .debs
the time is ripe.</i>" Seth Cohn has provided a <a href="mail#mail1">summary</a>
of the discussions on the debian-freshmeat list.
