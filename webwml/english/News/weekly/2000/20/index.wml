<a href="http://www.amirixlinux.com/">AMIRIX Linux</a> is a Debian-based
distribution aimed at the embedded Linux space. AMERIX is the prinicpal 
sponsor of the <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Embedded Debian Project</a>,
which aims to "<i>make Debian GNU/Linux a natural choice for 
eembedded Linux.</i>" "<i>This is an independent project, and is not
formally associated with Debian. We plan on working closely with Debian, with
the goal of our work eventually being integrated into the mainstream. </i>"
The project was announced to the debian-devel mailing
list back in May, but Debian Weekly News missed
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg00294.html">the
announcement</a>, which gives some background to the project.
