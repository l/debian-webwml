<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Test Cycle 2 has ended, here is a summary from AJ.

</p>

<p>
This week's security fixes:
<ul>
<li>A new version of X was installed into frozen, fixing a denial of
service attack, a symlink attack, and 4 security holes in Xlib.

<p>
<a href="http://www.amirixlinux.com/">AMIRIX Linux</a> is a Debian-based
distribution aimed at the embedded Linux space. AMERIX is the prinicpal 
sponsor of the <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Embedded Debian Project</a>,
which aims to "<i>make Debian GNU/Linux a natural choice for 
eembedded Linux.</i>" "<i>This is an independent project, and is not
formally associated with Debian. We plan on working closely with Debian, with
the goal of our work eventually being integrated into the mainstream. </i>"
The project was announced to the debian-devel mailing
list back in May, but Debian Weekly News missed
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-0005/msg00294.html">the
announcement</a>, which gives some background to the project. 
</p>

<p>
Many <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-0006/threads.html">
install and upgrade reports</a> have been posted in the past couple of
weeks, most successful, but here's one that stands out
(20000623163232.A19364@Tonelli.sns.it). It's an upgrade
from a system running Debian 1.3 all the way to frozen in one step, and it
worked fine except one small glitch. "<i>thanks and big kudos to all
Debian: it is quite uncommon that an operating system may upgrade like this
(consider also that it passed from a libc5 to a libc6 arch...
and it took just 45 minutes)</i>"
