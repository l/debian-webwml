#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="January 11th, 2000" SUMMARY="Preparations for the freeze"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
The freeze is just a few days off, and things appear to be going according
to plan so far. Tradition says we are due for a drive crash in one of our
servers, but that hasn't happened yet. And in a welcome change of pace, a new
version of X was released just in time to be slid into unstable before the
freeze, rather than just too late.
(20000112200005.24126.qmail@master.debian.org) Lots of freeze related
activity is going on, from a <em>Grand Bug Bash Festival</em> this weekend
that caused another dip in the 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical bug
graph</a>, to a slew of new upstream versions of packages being uploaded
just in time for the freeze. Work continues on the install. Traffic on the
mailing lists has been as heavy as usual, but without many long threads for
DWN to report on. The overall impression is one of lots of people hard at
work.
</p>

<p>
One final minor release of Debian 2.1 may happen, to take care of the
remaining y2k problems, and a few more security holes.
(Pine.LNX.4.20.0001091701320.25684-200000@v2.ldsol.com) Speaking of security
holes, three new security fixes are out, one for
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00000.html">
nvi</a> that fixes a hole that allowed removal of files in the root
directory, another for a remote exploit of
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00001.html">
lpr</a>, and another for mysql (20000112195631.16106.qmail@master.debian.org)
that allowed the test user to change root's password. The new X mentioned
above also fixes a security hole in imake.
