#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="January 12th, 2000" SUMMARY="Preparations for the freeze"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The freeze is just a few days off, and things appear to be going according
to plan so far.</b> Tradition says we are due for a drive crash in one of our
servers, but that hasn't happened yet. And in a welcome change of pace, a new
version of X was released just in time to be <a href="mail#1">slid</a> into
unstable</a> before the freeze, rather than just too late. Lots of freeze
related activity is going on, from a <em>Grand Bug Bash Festival</em> this
weekend that caused another dip in the
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical bug
graph</a>, to a slew of new upstream versions of packages being uploaded
just in time for the freeze. Work continues on the boot floppies. Traffic on
the mailing lists has been as heavy as usual, but without many long threads for
DWN to report on. The overall impression is one of lots of people hard at
work.
</p>

<p>
<b>One final minor release of Debian 2.1<b> 
<a href="../../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-release-0001/msg00041.html">may
happen</b>, to take care of the remaining y2k problems, and a few more security
holes. Speaking of security holes, three new security fixes are out, one for
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00000.html">
nvi</a> that fixes a hole that allowed removal of files in the root
directory, another for a remote exploit of
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-00/msg00001.html">
lpr</a>, and another for <a href="mail#2">mysql</a> that allowed the test user
to change root's password. The new X mentioned above also fixes a security hole
in imake.

<p>
A positive and very clueful
<a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reviews/1370/1/">review</a>
of Debian appeared in LinuxPlanet.
"<i>Debian's sophisticated package management greatly simplifies software
installations and upgrades and contributes greatly to stability and
reliability of the system. Of course, it's not entirely foolproof</i>".
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> in Debian this week include the following and
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs-20000110.html">121 more</a>:
