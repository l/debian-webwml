<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes</b> this week include an updated version of
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0008/msg01998.html">
netscape</a> that fixes several security holes including the "Brown Orfice"
hole, a fix for a remote root exploit in
<a href="http://lwn.net/daily/deb-ntop.php3">ntop</a>, a fun URL vulnerability
in <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0008/msg02384.html">
xchat</a>, and a remote file access problem in 
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/69916">eruby</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The "testing" distribution, as discussed last week, may not become a
reality as soon as was hoped.</b> The holdup is Debian's mirror metwork.
Anthony Towns has identified a situation related to moving packages,
(20000825002711.C14682@azure.humbug.org.au)
that will make testing, as it is implemented now, eat about 50 MB of
bandwidth a day on each Debian mirror. The long term solution to this
type of problem is a package pool system. Of course, we've been talking
about package pools for years now. To make testing happen soon, we need to
come up with a good short-term solution, and so far, no one has.
