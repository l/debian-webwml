#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="August 8th, 2000" SUMMARY="More preparations for release."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>A release announcement is being prepared.</b> A lot of 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00160.html">
brainstorming</a> has been going on as we try to find and remember 
important changes in potato that we can brag about, and several rough 
drafts of a release announcment have been written.
</p>

<p>
<b>Members of the #debian irc channel on irc.debian.org are preparing for the
onslaught of questions when Debian 2.2 is released.</b> They're organizing a
round-the-clock support crew dubbed the "<i>Mobile Array of Support Helpers 
for Potato (MashPotato)</i>" that will "<i>provide the most comprehensive 
Debian  GNU/Linux support service that we can to users both new and old.</i>"

<p>
<b>This week's security fixes</b> include a fix to a hole in unstable's
package mailman package
(m13LuMY-000alTC@finlandia.Infodrom.North.DE), and a fix to a hole in
ntop's web mode that allowed attackers to view any file on the system.

A security hole in mailx and suidperl is the big security hole of the week,
but Debian narrowly escaped being vulnerable.

<b>Debian will be awarded the $25,000 IDG/Linus Torvalds Community
Award</b> at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. Here's the
<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy40qbKbyti2mZC">
full announcment</a>. This should happen roughly at the same time Debian
2.2 is released, and a release party of some sort is planned to happen
during LinuxWorld, which is shaping up to be an eventful show for Debian.

<p>
Storm Linux 2000 Starter Edition has been released. Interestingly,
their
<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy:fWbWbtefuvta4mG">press
release</a> says it is "<i>built around the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato"
release, the most stable and secure distribution available</i>", even though
2.2 is not yet released. Also, another Debian-based distribution has
shown up: <a href="http://www.demolinux.org/">DemoLinux</a> 2.0 is now
<a href="http://www.demolinux.org/en/versions/version-debian.html">Debian
based</a>. And here is a Corel to Debian micro-howto.
