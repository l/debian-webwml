<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian will be awarded the $25,000 IDG/Linus Torvalds Community
Award</b> at LinuxWorld Conference and Expo. Here's the
<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy40qbKbyti2mZC">
full announcement</a>. This should happen roughly at the same time Debian
2.2 is released, and a release party of some sort is planned to happen
during LinuxWorld, which is shaping up to be an eventful show for Debian.
</p>

<p>
<b>A release announcement is being prepared.</b> A lot of 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00160.html">
brainstorming</a> has been going on as we try to find and remember 
important changes in potato that we can brag about, and several rough 
drafts have already been written.
</p>

<p>
<b>Members of the #debian irc channel on irc.debian.org are preparing for the
onslaught of questions when Debian 2.2 is released.</b> They're 
<a href="mail#1">organising a round-the-clock support crew</a> dubbed the 
"<i>Mobile Array of Support Helpers  for Potato (MashPotato)</i>" that will 
"<i>provide the most comprehensive  Debian  GNU/Linux support service that 
we can to users both new and old.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>This week's security fixes</b> include a
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&amp;date=2000-08-01&amp;msg=kK1VsC.A.fv.4iVj5@murphy">
fix for a hole</a>
in unstable's mailman package that allowed local users to take over the 
<tt>list</tt> user, and a
<a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/templates/archive.pike?list=1&amp;date=2000-08-01&amp;msg=EoeHb.A.ILB.Hjyj5@murphy">
security fix for ntop</a> that fixes that program's web mode so it cannot be
used to view every file on the system.
A security hole in mailx and suidperl is the big security hole of the week,
but Debian
<a href="http://cgi.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?archive=no&amp;bug=68723&amp;reverse=yes">
narrowly escaped</a> being vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
<b>More news from Debian-derived distributions.</b>
Storm Linux 2000 Starter Edition has been released. Interestingly,
their
<a href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=Coy:fWbWbtefuvta4mG">press
release</a> says it is "<i>built around the Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato"
release, the most stable and secure distribution available</i>", even though
2.2 is not yet released. Also, another Debian-based distribution has
shown up: <a href="http://www.demolinux.org/">DemoLinux</a> 2.0 is now
<a href="http://www.demolinux.org/en/versions/version-debian.html">Debian
based</a>. And finally, any Corel users who want to upgrade to potato can
check out this <a href="mail#2">Corel to Debian micro-howto</a>.
