<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

<p>
A release announcement is being prepared. A lot of brainstorming has been 
going on as we try to find and remember important changes in potato that we
can brag about. (** link to my thread **)

Members of the #debian irc channel on irc.debian.org are preparing for the
onslaught of questions when Debian 2.2 is released. They're organizing a
support crew dubbed the "<i>Mobile Array of Support Helpers for Potato
(MashPotato)</i>" that will "<i>provide the most comprehensive Debian 
GNU/Linux support service that we can to users both new and old.</i>"
