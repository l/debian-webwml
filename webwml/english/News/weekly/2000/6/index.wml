<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The candidates for Debian Project Leader participated on a debate on
IRC.</b> Issues discussed included new-maintainer, dealing with Debian's
growth, ports to other OS's, the infamous Debian cabal, and the future
of Debian.
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~treacy/debate/transcript.html">A transcript</a>
is available, and the <a href="http://www.debian.org/~treacy/debate/">debate
web site</a> also has speeches and platforms to help you get to know the
candidates. Elections start in one week.
</p>

<p>
Speaking as release manager, Richard Braakman outlined his 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0002/msg00011.html">
new plan</a> for cutting down on the number of
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical
bugs</a>. The plan centers around the "<i>Bug Horizon</i>", which is now set
for the 28th. <b>Any package that passes through the bug horizon with release
critical bugs that have been unchanged for  2 weeks will be removed from
Debian.</b> This is rather draconian, but seems likely to be quite effective at
motivating people to fix release critical bugs!
</p>

<p>
<b>Version 2.2.7 of the boot floppies has been released</b>, and as usual
anyone can help the boot floppies team by 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-0002/msg00056.html">
