Speaking as release manager, Richard Braakman outlined his new plan
(20000215002409.A2430@xs4all.nl) for cutting down on the number of
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical
bugs</a>. Richard has noted down all release critical bugs that exist now. On
the 28th, he will examine each of these bugs, and if it has not been changed
for 2 full weeks, the package with the bug will be removed from frozen. This
is rather draconian, but seems likely to be quite effective at motivating
people to fix release critical bugs.
