<p> Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily basis
(<a href="$(HOME)/security/2017/">Security Advisories 2017</a> and

<p><b>Updated Debian 9 and Debian 8: 9.3 and 8.10 released</b></p>
<p>The Debian project <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2017/2017120902">announced</a> 
the third update of its stable distribution Debian 9 (codename <q>Stretch</q>) on 9 December 2017 
to point release 9.3.</p>

<p>The Debian project also <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2017/20171209">announced</a>
the tenth update of its oldstable distribution Debian 8 (codename <q>Jessie</q>) on 9 December 2017
to point release 8.10.</p>

<p>These point releases added corrections for security issues,
along with a few adjustments for serious problems.
Security advisories have already been published separately and are referenced where available.

Upgrading an existing installation to either revision can be achieved
by pointing the package management system at one of Debian's many HTTP mirrors.
A comprehensive list of mirrors is available at: <a href="https://www.debian.org/mirror/list">https://www.debian.org/mirror/list</a>
</p>


<p><b>FAI.me build service for installation images</b></p>

<p>Thomas Lange has
<a href="https://lists.uni-koeln.de/pipermail/linux-fai/2017-November/011869.html">
announced</a> the <a href="https://fai-project.org/FAIme">FAI.me build
service</a> for customised installation images. On this web page, you
can create customised images with only a few clicks. It supports
different Debian distributions, all common desktop environments,
several locales, backported kernels, and the option of entering a list
of packages. After some time you can download your own ISO
image which does a fully automatic installation using <a
href="https://fai-project.org">FAI</a>.

<p><b>Debsources now in sources.debian.org</b></p>

The Debsources team is happy to 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2017/12/msg00000.html">announce</a>
that <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/qa/debsources/">Debsources</a>,
which provides direct web access to the Debian operating system source code,
has been moved onto the official Debian infrastructure at 
<a href="https://sources.debian.org">https://sources.debian.org</a>. 
Debsources allows users to directly browse available source packages
and to peruse and highlight portions of the source code files for
every Debian release. It provides links via <a href="https://sources.debian.org,">HTML</a>
and an <a href="https://sources.debian.org/doc/api/">API</a> for programmatic use.

<p><b>Discussions</b></p>

<p>On the Debian-user mailing list, Debian user Jason asked
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/01/msg00212.html">how
to create a PDF-Printer from the command line</a>.

A large discussion covered many questions asking: Is (La)TeX text or not,
what exactly is a mimetype, why not a2ps or lp, and file bloat for PDF creation.
There are lots of tips and tricks throughout the thread for those wondering
about the same question.
</p>

<p>Debian user Richard Hector asked about the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/02/msg00073.html">policy
on the <q>wontfix</q> bug tag used by maintainers</a>.
The thread covered many topics and discussions about the actual output from the
date command, interactive shells, the question of <q>what day is it
really?</q>, the fuzzy grammar of the date string, parsers, mail LDOSUBSCRIBER, and the formail
component of procmail. A very interesting read!</p>
