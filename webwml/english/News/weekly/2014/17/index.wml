<toc-add-entry name="DC_Editing">Online Source Editing</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Inspired by GitHub's online code editing and Stefano Zacchiroli's presentation at Debconf14,
Raphael Geissert
<a
href="http://rgeissert.blogspot.com/2014/12/editing-debian-online-with.html">has
announced an integrated online editor</a>
for <a href="http://sources.debian.net/">debsources</a>. The Chromium
extension allows users to edit debsources without having to download source packages and without leaving their
browser.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="DCS">Debian Code Search</toc-add-entry>
<p> 
With the shutdown of Google Code Search in January 2012, Open Source
(FLOSS) software developers lost a valuable coding tool. Michael Stapelberg 
developed <a href="http://codesearch.debian.net/">Debian Code Search</a>, and
launched it in November 2012. Debian Code Search provides Debian
and FLOSS developers with a source-code search engine for over 129 GiB of FLOSS software
currently available in Debian, searchable using regular expressions.
</p>
<p>
Recently a new version of Debian Code Search has been launched.
Michael Stapelberg
<a
href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg/2014/12/23/code-search-taming-the-latency-tail.html">blogged
highlighting several improvements</a>,
including grouping search results by 
Debian source package. The top ten search results are available almost
immediately while the query continues, as indicated with a new progress bar.
Packages that are uploaded to Debian become searchable in Debian Code Search
in a couple of minutes or within the hour, instead of taking up to a week. Users
will find that the new Debian Code Search site has a modern user interface
providing cleaner search results achieved through CSS animations.

<p>
Steve McIntyre
<a href="http://blog.einval.com/2014/11/20#Jessie-EFI">updated his blog</a>
explaining progress toward improved UEFI support for Debian Jessie. 
In collaboration with the Grub developers, Steve continues to work hard squashing
bugs. He readily recognises much more work is needed, especially with i386 
UEFI and 32-bit Intel Macs. Steve is reaching out to those that can test
32-bit UEFI, as he and other developers work hard in preparation for Jessie's 
release.

<toc-add-entry name="grtc">Technical Committee Term Limits</toc-add-entry>
<p>
A General Resolution has been submitted for a vote by Debian Members
regarding <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2014/vote_004">term limits for Technical Committee members</a>.
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/12/msg00010.html">Voting</a>
remains open until January 8, 23:59 UTC.</p>
This is a vote to change the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">Debian Constitution</a>.
The two proposals are similar, both creating term limits for Technical Committee members. The 
proposals differ in how they handle two or more committee members leaving within
the same year. The first proposes to set a hard term limit at 3.5 years, while
the second suggests a mechanism for a soft limit of 4.5 years, keeping
track of the most senior committee members.
<a href="$(HOME)/vote/howto_follow">Standard Resolution Procedure</a> will govern the voting process.

<toc-add-entry name="4th_LTS">Debian Long Term Support and Freexian's 4th report</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Freexian's <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/12/11/freexians-fourth-report-about-debian-long-term-support/">fourth report on Debian Long Term Support</a> was released.
</p>
<p>
For the month of November 2014, 42.5 work hours were allotted towards the LTS 
project.
</p>
<p>
The monthly allotment of 45.7 hours has not increased and at this time talks 
are underway to attract more sponsors and reach out to some companies who have
announced their willingness to contribute. The overall goal of the funding is to
be able to fund the equivalent of a <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">half time position</a>. If your company is able to
help, please contribute towards this effort.
</p>
<p>
Freexian had previously mentioned the possibility of recruiting more paid 
contributors to the pool to better share the workload, and to that end, extended 
offers to Ben Hutchings and Mike Gabriel who both accepted.
</p>
<p>
Thorsten Alteholz worked 14.25 hours of paid LTS work and focused on new 
versions of curl, imagemagick, and wget among other packages. He also <a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/11/my-debian-activities-in-november-2014/">wonders</a> 
why LTS users seem to be scant when needed to test releases before they move
to the archive, but seem numerous when complaints arise about an upload.
</p>
<p>
Raphael Hertzog did <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/12/02/my-free-software-activities-in-november-2014/">18
hours of paid LTS support</a>, including CVE triage with 19Â commits to the security tracker, and
updates to dbus, libgcrypt11, and openjdk-6 security.

A fair amount of time was allotted to updating the kernel to upstream 2.6.32.64,
with the integration of new patches and the removal of some old ones. The
<q>openvz flavour</q> kernel patch required quite a bit of tweaking and manual conflict resolution.
Raphael reached out to Ben Hutchings asking him to join the project as a paid 
LTS contributor to take care of the kernel, which Ben accepted. Prior to
Ben's involvement no kernel updates had been performed in Squeeze since July;
this will change now as there is someone dedicated and able to handle it as a 
priority. Thank you Ben!
</p>
<p>
Holger Levsen's <a href="http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20141201-lts-november-2014/">LTS
work for November</a> focused on security updates for ruby1.8,
tomcat6, and tomcat-native. He also wrote about the newest contributor to the
team effort and the work to identify a problem in the openvz patch.
</p>
<p>
Readers are reminded that the LTS project needs support, testers, donations and 
help to continue this effort. Please see the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/">LTS mailing list</a> for additional details.

Testers are currently needed for <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/2014/11/msg00038.html">the upstream 2.6.32.64 kernel</a>.
</p>
<p>
The security situation in LTS improved with 27 packages awaiting a security 
update, with the list of open vulnerabilites in Squeeze showing 58 in total. 
The backlog is slowly being reduced and solutions are being sought for
the SSLv3 POODLE issue.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="C++">C++11 talk, notes, and use in Jessie</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Enrico Zini <a href="http://www.enricozini.org/2014/cxx11-talk-examples/">shared examples</a> from a talk he gave about C++ and new 
features introduced with C++11. He details working with wrapper interfaces, 
library exceptions, and cast operators which can be transparently passed to the
underlying libraries. He also posted his <a href="http://www.enricozini.org/2014/cxx11-talk-notes/">talk notes</a> which include working
with essential tools, tips, functions and many examples.
</p>
<p>
Enrico also notes that users will need at least g++ 4.8 or clang 3.3 to have 
full C++11 support. Both will be available in Jessie; Wheezy users can use the
nightly clang packages repository. 
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="Buggy">Bug Reports for Jessie</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Niels Thykier <a href="http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2014/12/08/jessie-has-half-the-number-of-rc-bugs-compared-to-wheezy/">blogged</a>
that as of December 8, Jessie had half the number
of Release-Critical bugs compared to Wheezy. He followed up with a link to the
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">RC bug stats graph</a>, which also shows historical data. 
</p>
<p>
Richard Hartmann <a href="http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2014/12/19-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_51/">updated</a>
the Release Critical Bug report for Week 51. The
bugs interface shows <a href="https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=any&amp;merged=ign&amp;rc=1&amp;chints=1&amp;cdeferred=1&amp;crttags=1">1,095</a>
RC bugs of which 189 directly affect Jessie. We will need to get that number to zero before the release. 
<a href="https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi?release=jessie_not_sid&amp;merged=ign&amp;fnewerval=7&amp;rc=1&amp;sortby=id&amp;sorto=asc&amp;chints=1&amp;ctags=1&amp;cdeferred=1&amp;crttags=1&amp;chints=1&amp;cdeferred=1&amp;crttags=1">55</a>
bugs in unstable have been fixed and need to migrate to Jessie. Users are
encouraged to investigate and submit unblock requests for those packages. This
came on the heels of Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=854">wondering</a> if we could release Jessie
before the opening of FOSDEM 15.
Can we?

<toc-add-entry name="WDYD">DPN asks: Auditors, What do you do?</toc-add-entry>
<p>
<a href="$(HOME)">Debian</a> is a large global community of a lot of small actors, projects, and 
teams. This month as part of a special feature we'd like to share with you 
something about a project or a team that is working in Debian that you 
may not be aware of.
</p>

<p>
When reading the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Auditor">Debian Auditor team's Wiki page</a>, which lists the
responsibilities and duties of the team, one must wonder how such a busy
team seems to stay just under the radar.
<p>
We asked the auditing team for a bit of insight; Brian Gupta responds:
</p>
<p>
<q>Historically the auditor team was only responsible for accounting and 
asset tracking.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Currently the team's responsibilities are in the process of expanding to
also include helping the DPL track reimbursement requests, working 
with Trusted Organizations, and taking point in overall project fundraising.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Since Debian doesn't have a dedicated general fund raising team, we've
been helping coordinate fund-raising, most recently help <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2014/10/msg00011.html">fund Debian's
participation in the Outreach Program for Women</a>. This complements
the work of the DebConf fundraising team, which we share some team
members with.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>We've also helped to facilitate <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/Reimbursement">reimbursements</a> for various expenses
that the Debian Project Leader approves such as <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints">Sprints</a>, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP">Bug Squashing Parties</a>,
and the miniconfs. We also help track Hardware expenses.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>I personally have been working along with Paul Wise to streamline the
donations page, Paul has been invaluable in this effort and you can see
the efforts on <a href="$(HOME)/donations">the new Donations page</a>.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>That said, I think that the name <q>auditor</q> team may be a misnomer, and
perhaps <q>finance</q> team would be better, with the understanding that it
is just a name, and all of Debian's assets aren't financial.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Another task that we've been working on, is working with <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a> (SPI) 
to enable them to accept Paypal donations. This 
should be done soon.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>I suspect over time, that the auditor/finance team will work more and
more closely with our <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/TrustedOrganizationCriteria">Trusted Organizations</a>. We already have two
auditor team members, Philip Hug on the Debian.ch board and Martin
Michlmayr on the SPI board, that are also Trusted Organization board 
members.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>Our team can really use help. In particular, we can really use help 
improving the reimbursement workflow, as this is currently an overly
time consuming manual process and there doesn't seem to be many 
obvious Free Software tools to help streamline this process, nor do the
current team members have the time to tackle this.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>In addition, we also need someone who has time and skills to help us 
implement and manage a CRM system to coordinate fundraising 
efforts for both Debian as a whole, as well as DebConf fundraising. 
(Likely CiviCRM, but that's not set in stone.)
</q>
</p>
<p>
We hope that you enjoyed reading about the Audit team, for more information 
about the team, or if you are interested and able to help assist the team, 
please contact them via <a href="mailto:auditor@debian.org">email</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>
For the holiday season, Gregor Herrmann offered us a series of short blog posts
(starting <a href="http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/gdac_2014_1.html">here</a>),
one every day, to show the bright side of Debian and why it is fun for him to
contribute.
</p>
<p>
Gregor Herrmann blogged on RC bugs he worked on in late <a href="http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/rc_bugs_2014_47_48.html">November</a>
and <a href="http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/rc_bugs_2014_49_50.html">December</a>.  
</p>

<p>
Raphael Hertzog <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/12/02/my-free-software-activities-in-november-2014/">mentioned
in his report of activities for November</a> that he drafted a
<a href="http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep14/">recommended layout for Git packaging repositories</a> which was submitted for discussion
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/11/msg00444.html">on the debian-devel mailing list</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2014/11/Debsources_Participation_in_FOSS_Outreach_Program/">Jingjie Jiang</a>,
Debian <a href="http://gnome.org/opw/">OPW</a> <a href="https://identi.ca/debian/note/IYTLgqAKQAyqUCI5-O5wDg">intern</a>,
started to <a href="http://sophiejjj.wordpress.com/2014/12/12/week1/">blog</a> about her work on debsources.
She is looking forward to  
working on the project and has already started with bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=763921">#763921</a> concerning
the presentation of directory listings.
</p>

<p>
Tomasz Buchert 
<a href="https://tomasz.buchert.pl/blog/2014/12/04/bsp-in-munich/">reported</a>
on the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2014/11/de/Munich">Munich 2014 Bug Squashing Party</a> which was
sponsored and hosted by <a href="http://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/Stadtverwaltung/Direktorium/LiMux.html">LiMux</a> and gathered people from KDE, Kolab, and 
LibreOffice. Among many bugs squashed were <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/768673#12">#768673 for ruby-httpclient</a>, 
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/768695#24">#768695 for statsmodels</a>, and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/768690#17">#768690 for latex-mk</a>. Tomasz also points out
another benefit for him of attending a BSP which is not just collaboration or meeting
and working with Debian Developers, but also signing GPG keys and getting more signatures on his GPG key.
