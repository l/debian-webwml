<toc-add-entry name="DC15Spon">DebConf15 welcomes its first eleven sponsors!</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Each year for the past 14 years, Debian has held an <a href="http://debconf.org/">annual conference</a> for 
developers and users. Next year, <a href="http://debconf15.debconf.org/">DebConf15</a> will take place in Heidelberg, 
Germany in August of 2015. Nine companies had already committed to <a href="https://bits.debian.org/tag/debconf.html">sponsoring</a> 
the event by mid-November, and two more have joined since: credativ, sipgate, Matanel Foundation, Google, Fairsight Security, Martin Alfke / Buero 2.0,
Ubuntu, Mirantis, Logilab, Netways, and Hetzner.  Should you know of an organisation that
would like to become a sponsor for the event, the DebConf team invites you to 
please have a look at the <a href="http://media.debconf.org/dc15/fundraising/debconf15_sponsorship_brochure.pdf">sponsorship brochure</a> which has all of the details. 
Looking forward to a great conference!

<toc-add-entry name="DebCalc">Debian running on a graphing calculator</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Of interest out on the web was a post from hackaday.com about 
<a href="http://hackaday.com/2014/11/18/running-debian-on-a-graphing-calculator/">Debian in use and running on a graphing calculator</a>. The build was done using
available open-source tools and an ARM emulator then uploaded to the device.
Ivoah of the omnimaga forums shares the details and a how-to in greater depth 
along with a video in a <a href="http://codinghobbit.no-ip.org/blog/?p=81">blog</a> post.

<toc-add-entry name="init_vote">Votes on the General Resolution on init system coupling</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The Debian Developer community <a href="https://vote.debian.org/~secretary/gr_initcoupling/results.txt">voted</a> and decided that no General Resolution 
was needed on init system coupling. The General Resolution <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2014/vote_003">init system coupling vote</a>
was proposed in response to a Technical Committee decision choosing systemd as 
the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=727708#6734">default init system for Linux architectures</a>. Of the 5 available options for
voting, option #4 “General Resolution is not required" won the <a href="https://vote.debian.org/~secretary/gr_initcoupling/tally.txt">vote</a>. 
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="Med_Bits">Bits from the Debian Med team</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The version number of the debian-med metapackages was bumped to 1.99 as a signal 
of the plan to release version 2.0 with Jessie. This release contains for the 
first time some support for Hospital Information Systems (HIS).
</p>
<p>
The team worked hard to enable DFSG free licenses and get packages moved from non-free into main;
they were in continuous discussion with Joe Felsenstein, the author of PHYLIP, who happily decided to move to a
free license, with PHYLIP being released in September under a <a href="http://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.html">BSD-2-clause</a>
license. The team's efforts on license change show that it is possible to 
get positive change in licensing that benefits everyone, and they hope
their approach can be used in similar situations.
</p>
<p>
The team is also involved in a paper which will be at <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/">BioMed Central</a>. The title will be
<q>Community-driven development for computational biology at Sprints, Hackathons
and Codefests</q>.
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the Debian Med team will have a  <a href="http://debian-med.alteholz.de/advent/">Bug Squashing Advent Calendar</a>. Feel
free to join them in their bug squashing effort where they (and you!) will be closing bugs.

<toc-add-entry name="LTS">Freexian's third report about Debian Long Term Support</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Debian <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Long Term Support</a> (LTS) is a joint effort of <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">paid contributors</a> and 
sponsors to continue the release cycle for <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianOldStable">oldstable</a> (Squeeze). The month of October in 2014 had 13.75 hours
allotted across three contributors: Thorsten Alteholz, Raphaël Hertzog, and
Holger Levsen. The effort gained two new sponsors, <a href="http://daevel.fr/">Daevel</a> and <a href="http://www.fosster.com/">FOSSter</a>, and now
has 45.5 hours of paid LTS work to <q>spend</q> each month. Great news and progress but
still far from <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">the minimal goal of funding the equivalent of a half-time position</a>.
Should the backlog grow further, they will <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts-details.html#join">look for more paid contributors</a>
to share the workload. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, the dla-needed.txt file lists 33 packages awaiting
an update, down six from last month. The list of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/status/release/oldstable">open vulnerabilities in Squeeze</a>
showed about 60 affected packages in total, which is explained by CVE
triaging for Squeeze which had not been done the past few days, and the POODLE
issues with SSLv3 affecting a very large number of packages.
</p>
<p>It's never too late to <a href="http://www.freexian.com/en/services/debian-lts.html">join the growing list of sponsors</a>.
LTS asks users and interested parties to please check with their company
and managers to help with the effort via sponsorship. If that is not possible
this year, please consider including this work and the effort in your budgets
for next year.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="newcomer_tag">Newcomer tag in BTS</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Don Armstrong <a href="http://www.donarmstrong.com/posts/newcomer_bts_tag/">updates</a> us with a new <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/"><acronym title="Bug Tracking System">BTS</acronym></a> tag: <q>newcomer</q>.
You may already be aware of the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/GiftTag"><q>gift</q> tag</a>, which has been used for
a while to indicate bugs which are suitable for new contributors to use as an
entry point to working on specific packages. The <q>newcomer</q> tag has been added as a
more appropriately named equivalent and has been added to the BTS documentation.
</p>
<p>
All of the previously tagged <q>gift</q> bugs have been tagged with the new <q>newcomer</q> tag.
</p>
<p>
If you have bugs in your package which you think are ideal for new contributors
to Debian, or you have a package that needs to be fixed, please tag them 
<q>newcomer</q>. If you're getting started in Debian, and working on bugs to fix, please <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=newcomer">search</a>
for the <q>newcomer</q> tag, grab the helm, and contribute to Debian.

<toc-add-entry name="OPW">FOSS Outreach program for women</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli and Don Armstrong announced Virginia King and Jingie Jiang 
as two of the three intern placements as part of Debian's <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">participation</a> in the
<a href="https://gnome.org/opw/">FOSS Outreach Program for women</a>.
</p>
<p>
Starting December 9 through March 9 Virginia will be working on improving
the documentation of the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/">Debian bug tracking system</a>, and Jinjie will be working
on <a href="http://sources.debian.net/">Debsources</a>. Welcome aboard!

<toc-add-entry name="Release">Release Team Sprint Results</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Jonathan Wiltshire <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/11/msg00005.html">updates</a>
us with the results of the Release Team Sprint. Four
days after the November 5, 2014 freeze date, they processed 162 unblock
requests. Of those, 17 required further information from the submitters. 
</p>
<p>
The team is seeking patches and editors for the release notes, particularly:
init system changes; how to choose before upgrading; pros and cons of
upgrading; and the dropping of i486 support.
</p>
<p>
The codenames have been chosen for the next future releases: Debian 9 <q>Stretch</q>
and  Debian 10 <q>Buster</q>.
</p>
<p>
Cyril Brulebois is co-ordinating artwork for Jessie, and expects that it will 
be ready before the holiday season. Jessie's <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/Lines">artwork is available for viewing</a>, 
with thanks to all the many contributors who contributed artwork.
</p>
<p>
The team asks that you please carry out upgrade tests from Wheezy to Jessie,
and file your experiences against the upgrade-reports pseudo-package. They
would also appreciate tests of fresh installations, with reports against 
installation-reports.
</p>
<p>
arm64 and ppc64el have made enough progress to be release architectures for 
Jessie. Regressions for arm64 and ppc64el are now release critical, but 
non-regressions are not.
</p>
<p>
The team discussed kfreebsd at length, but were not satisfied that a release with 
Jessie would be of sufficient quality. As a result, they are dropping it as an
official release architecture. They hope that the porters will be able to make a 
simultaneous unofficial release.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="FUN">Fun and Sanity in Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Enrico Zini was asked, <q>is there anything happening in Debian besides systemd?</q>
Of course there is, he thought! We froze on time and with a very low RC bug
count and there is a lot going on. To prove it, and to honestly answer the 
question he created a <a href="http://gobby.debian.org/export/minidebconf-uk_2014/Fun%20and%20Sanity">gobby document</a> about <q>Fun and Sanity</q> in Debian then passed
the link around in IRC and at the 2014 Cambridge Miniconf. He <a href="http://enricozini.org/2014/debian/fun-and-sanity/">shared</a> some of the
great responses.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="minicon">Notes on the Cambridge Mini-DebConf</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve McIntyre posted about the second Mini-DebConf in Cambridge, UK at the ARM
offices.  Sprint work was scheduled for Thursday and Friday on a range
of Debian topics: installer, admin, ARM arch support, etc.
Several volunteers from the DebConf video team were on hand, so the talks were
recorded and are <a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2014/mini-debconf-cambridge/webm/">online</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Mini-DebConf went well, and feedback from attendees was universally positive.
He states they may run it again next year, but more importantly, confirms that 
they are definitely planning on bidding to host a full DebConf in Cambridge in
the summer of 2017.

<toc-add-entry name="DC14final">DebConf14 final report</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="http://media.debconf.org/dc14/report/DebConf14_final_report.en.pdf">final report for DebConf14</a> has been released, here are a few excerpts:
</p>
<p>
<q><i>DebConf talks and discussions are important opportunities to raise new 
proposals for development, to inform other contributors about technical 
advances they can build on in their own work, and, last but not least, to 
manage the wide cooperation required for each new Debian release.</i></q>
</p>
<p>
<q><i>DebConf is an oasis for those who need to find uninterrupted time to work on 
Debian in their regular schedule.</i></q>
</p>
<p>
Highlights included the keynote by Prof. Gabriella Coleman, a Q&amp;A session with Linus 
Torvalds, plenary talks by former Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli, 
hacking time, ad-hoc sessions, and <acronym title="Birds Of a Feather">BOF</acronym> meetings. Teams
in the background are brought to the forefront with information and 
introductions of the video team who capture and make available many of the 
talks online.

<toc-add-entry name="DDPT">Debian Description Translation Project</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Laura Arjona presents a <a href="http://larjona.wordpress.com/2014/11/19/translating-reviewing-debian-package-descriptions/">detailed walkthrough</a> on how to translate package
descriptions as part of the <a href="$(HOME)/international/l10n/ddtp">Debian Description Translation Project</a> (DDTP). It
is something that anyone can do without having to have great knowledge of 
translation tools. The guide has hints, tips, advice, and a pictorial on how 
to use the web interface.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="In_stable">How to get new packages into stable</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Ever wonder how to get new packages into stable? Neil Williams details in a 
<a href="http://linux.codehelp.co.uk/?p=153">blog posting</a> a very useful guide that he had intended to be a talk at the
<a href="https://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Miniconf-UK/2014">Mini-DebConf</a> in Cambridge, but instead decided to share as a useful reference
tool for the future. He starts off with some background on LAVA and tells how
he was able to get it into Jessie through uploads, working with other Debian 
Developers, team support, and patience.

<toc-add-entry name="BSP_Munich">LiMux Munich Bug Squashing Party</toc-add-entry>
<p>
A <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2014/11/de/Munich">Bug Squashing Party</a> (<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP">BSP</a>) took place in Munich, Germany, November 21 to 23, 
sponsored annually by the LiMux project. Several teams were represented from
Debian, KDE PIM, Kubuntu, Kolab, and LibreOffice. Ovidiu-Florin Bogdan <a href="http://blog.geekaliens.com/2014/11/awesome-bsp-in-munchen/">blogged</a>
and Jonathan Riddell <a href="http://jriddell.org/2014/11/22/blog-move-bug-squashing-party-in-munich/">posted</a> about major changes coming to Akonadi,
framework changes to KDE, and Qt4 theming with Plasma 5.

<toc-add-entry name="WDYD">DPN asks: Hams, What do you do?</toc-add-entry>
<p>
<a href="$(HOME)">Debian</a> is a large and global community of a lot of small actors, projects, and
teams. This month as part of a special feature we'd like to share with you
something about a project or a team that is working in Debian that you
may not be aware of.
</p>
<p>
Starting this off, we reached out to the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHams">Debian Ham-Radio Team</a> with 
the question: <q>Hams, What do you do?</q>
</p>
<p>
Ian Learmonth responds: 
<q>The Debian Hamradio Maintainers team collaborates on maintenance of
amateur-radio related packages for Debian. This includes packaging, writing
documentation, providing description translations and more for amateur-radio
related <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/hamradio/">packages</a>.
</q></p>
<p><q>
The team plans to release a Debian Pure Blend for amateur-radio with the
release of <a href="https://packages.debian.org/testing/hamradio/">Stretch</a>. This will make it easier for end users to explore the
software that is available to them for amateur-radio and will also allow us
to easily provide a live CD with all the amateur-radio software installed to
help people who want to try out Debian but are not yet ready to install it
to their hard drive.
</q></p>
<p><q>
We've recently had a number of new additions to the team, and these new
additions are being mentored for Debian packaging work by the team.
Packaging teams can be a great place for newcomers to find help with
packaging and you know that the person mentoring you will be interested in
the package too.
