<p>
Sylvestre Ledru
<a href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2014/01/15/debian-france-shop">reported on his blog</a>
that <a href="http://france.debian.net">Debian France</a>
has opened an <a href="http://www.enventelibre.org/debian">online shop</a>
with plenty of Debian goodies:
some are already familiar as they were sold during FOSDEM or various DebConfs (like the
<a href="http://www.enventelibre.org/goodies/couteau-suisse-debian">Swiss army knives</a>
or the 
<a href="http://www.enventelibre.org/vetement/polo-debian">classic polo shirts</a>),
but there are also 
<a href="http://www.enventelibre.org/vetement/t-shirt-debian-logo-gris">brand-new Wheezy-themed
t-shirts</a>.
The website is only in French, although an English version might exist in the
future.

<toc-add-entry name="valve">Valve games for Debian Members and Maintainers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Neil McGovern <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/01/msg00006.html">announced</a>
that
<a href="http://www.valvesoftware.com">Valve</a> wish to express their thanks to the
Debian community for the operating system on which they based
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/livingroom/SteamOS/">Steam OS</a>, a
distribution for gamers. They are offering to all Debian Members and Debian
Maintainers a free subscription which provides access to all past and future
Valve produced games.

If your cryptographic key is in the
<a href="https://keyring.debian.org/">Debian keyring</a> and you are interested
in this offer, send a GPG-signed email to
<a href="mailto:jo.shields@collabora.co.uk">Jo Shields</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="sip">Debian real-time communication</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Daniel Pocock
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/01/msg00004.html">announced</a>
the availability of a <a href="https://rtc.debian.org/">SIP service</a>
for Debian Members. This service, launched during the mini-DebConf in Paris,
offers real-time audio and video conversation through the browser (with WebRTC)
or a diverse range of traditional softphones, including Empathy, Jitsi, Lumicall,
Linphone, and CSIPSimple.

A <a href="https://freephonebox.net">phonebooth</a> is
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/01/msg00102.html">available</a>
for people wanting to reach Debian Members
through this service.

For more information on how to use this service, please consult the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/UnifiedCommunications/DebianDevelopers">dedicated
wiki page</a>.

This service has been made possible by a significant effort by the DSA
team over the last few weeks.

The Debian project is encouraging other free software projects, including
Debian derivatives, to emulate what Debian has done so that we can all call each other.
