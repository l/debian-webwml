<toc-add-entry name="debsources_stats">Debsources stats: Historical overview of Debian source code</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli wrote on
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/planet-debian">his blog</a> about the
<a href="http://sources.debian.net/stats">debsources statistics</a>
that he has been working on recently, announcing that they now draw on an
increased statistical basis, including all historical Debian releases since <q>Hamm</q>,
which was released in 1998. As for the usefulness of such
a laborious documenting task, Stefano points out that it allows us
<q>to appreciate macro-level evolution trends in
Free Software, over a period of more than 15 years, through
the eyes of a distro that sits at the nice intersection of
the eldest, largest, and most reputed distros.</q> By
combining information stored in the
<a href="http://archive.debian.org/">Debian archive</a>
and the <a href="http://sources.debian.net">debsources database</a>,
the debsources statistics provide some relevant information
about Debian's evolution, such as (for example) overviews in
table and graphical form of the amount of source code
written in the different programming languages used over
the years, thus contributing significantly to what Stefano
calls a <q>long-time preservation of digital information in
general, and for the perennity of access to Free Software
in the specific case of Debian</q>.

<toc-add-entry name="miniconf">Reports from Mini-DebConf Barcelona</toc-add-entry>

<p>
According to the <a href="http://tassia.wp.acaia.ca/2014/04/02/hello-world/">official stats</a>,
the Barcelona Mini-DebConf held last March was a great success, especially in
terms of participation by women: of the 160 attendees, 36% were women.
Tássia Camões Araújo, member of the organisation
team, explains: <q>as we didn’t collect gender information at the registration,
it is hard to make a clear comparison with previous DebConfs. Since 2007, the
rate of non-male participants ranged from 13% to 17%. For this Mini-DebConf,
the orga team did the gender identification per name and found a non-male rate
of 36%. Again, since the methods were not the same we cannot safely compare,
but still, I think it’s worth it to make this info public.</q>

<toc-add-entry name="CAcert">CAcert removed from Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Unlike all other certificate authorities, CAcert is a community-driven
certificate authority providing SSL/TLS certificates free of charge.
Not only because of that way of functioning, similar to
Debian's approach, Debian has been shipping the CAcert root
certificate since 2005, even after CAcert had withdrawn
its request to be included in Mozilla's trusted certificate
store back in 2007, due to an ongoing internal audit.
Discussion of whether to continue distributing CAcert's root
certificate in Debian's trusted certificate store arose in response to a
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718434">bug</a>
filed in July 2013 advocating its removal.
After months of debate on the pros and cons it was on March 13 that Michael Shuler,
the maintainer of the ca-certificates package, finally made public the
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=718434#129">decision</a>
to no longer ship the CAcert root certificate with Debian.
For a detailed summary of the discussion please refer to the
<a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/590879/">LWN article on the subject</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="RTC_VoIP_client">Discussion of a fully functional RTC/VoIP client for <q>Jessie</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>
Based on the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/03/msg00640.html">assessment</a>
made by Empathy's package maintainer, Simon Vittie,
that Empathy has an Instant Messaging background rather
than being very suited for voice and video, Daniel Pocock
has kicked off a discussion on his
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2014/03/msg00640.html">website</a>
about the convenience of choosing a new WebRTC-compliant
RTC/VoIP client for Debian 8 <q>Jessie</q>.
Arguing that any suitable client will need to support
the open WebRTC standard that has been embedded in
all Firefox/Iceweasel and Chromium/Chrome browsers
for more than a year now, Daniel gives a detailed comparison of
Empathy and Jitsi, concluding that in his view, the latter would be
the best choice for <q>Jessie</q>.
