<toc-add-entry name="Freezing">The Debian Community combats Global Warming with a Freeze.</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Release Team is proud to <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/11/msg00003.html">announce</a> that Debian 8.0 "Jessie" is frozen.
Further updates to this release will be restricted to bug fixes only.
</p>

<p>
With the freeze occurring as planned on November 5, Lucas Nussbaum
<a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=854">blogged</a>:
<q>This is quite an achievement from the project as a whole,
and the Release Team specifically. First, we froze on the date announced more
than a year ago, and the freeze seems to have been well respected by all 
maintainers.
Second, with 310 RC bugs at the time of the freeze, we are probably breaking 
a record for all recent Debian releases. Could we have the shorter Debian
freeze ever? Given that <a href="https://fosdem.org/2015/">FOSDEM</a>
is 12 weeks away, could we even release before FOSDEM, and have a big
party there to celebrate?</q>
</p>

<p>
Richard Hartmann posted the <a href="http://richardhartmann.de/blog/posts/2014/11/07-Debian_Release_Critical_Bug_report_for_Week_45/">Release Critical Bug report for Week 45</a> which 
highlights the work that needs to be done to push Jessie into release. There are
1,154 bugs of which 295 directly affect Jessie, which we need to get down to
zero. Of these, 229 are bugs which affect both Jessie and unstable and 66
affect Jessie only. He also posts a table of data which compares our
current status to the Squeeze release cycle. Not to be lost in the pretty data
and <a href="http://richardhartmann.de/img/rc_bugs_report_en_2014-45.png">graph</a>
is the request that if you are able, please look into the

<toc-add-entry name="Debkyo">Tokyo area Debian study group</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="https://tokyodebian.alioth.debian.org/">Tokyo area Debian
study group</a> held its 119th meeting starting with a
Debian common sense quiz, moving on to a discussion of the LibreOffice package 
in Debian and desires to see more upstream and downstream support. They
also had <a href="http://henrich-on-debian.blogspot.de/2014/11/meeting-event-with-libo-people-in-tokyo.html">a
hands-on event</a> for debian-installer beta2 for Debian 8 "Jessie".

<p>
Petter Reinholdtsen <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/10/msg00006.html">announced</a>
the first Jessie based Debian Edu release.
Debian Edu, also known as <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Skolelinux</a>, is a complete
operating system for schools,
with support for servers, workstations, and laptops working together on a 
school network. The creation of a multi-user multi-machine study environment 
can be completed in a few hours with hundreds of applications pre-installed. 
Further details of the release include information about its current 
distribution, <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Documentation/Jessie">documentation</a>,
and <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEdu/Status/Jessie">status</a>.

<p>
Raphaël Hertzog <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/11/04/my-debian-lts-report-for-october-2014/">reported</a>
on ten hours of paid LTS work with the CVE triage of
23 commits to the security tracker, the filing of several bug reports, a 
sponsored upload, and mysql-5.1 and apache2 security updates. This month he 
shares some thoughts on the workflow and user base of the project. The project 
still needs help from its users, who are asked to subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/">mailing list</a> 
and to test some of the packages being submitted, and help by way of 
organisations joining the project by providing help directly or <a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">sponsoring</a>
others to do the work.
</p>

<p>
Thorsten Alteholz
<a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/11/my-debian-activities-in-october-2014/">reported</a>
that he was assigned a workload of 13.75 hours towards Squeeze LTS
which allowed him to upload new versions of rsyslog, torque,
and libxml2 among others. He was also able to prepare a new upload of wget, 
and sends congratulatory kudos to the Security Team who deal with support on a 
daily basis.

<p>
Thorsten Alteholz <a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/11/my-debian-activities-in-october-2014/">also
blogged</a> his other October Debian activities which
started with working in the FTP assistant role, which has seen a spike of
uploads as developers try to get their packages in prior to the freeze.
</p>

<p>
Thomas Goirand greatly <a href="http://thomas.goirand.fr/blog/?p=225">detailed</a>
his OpenStack packaging activity for October.
His work involved patch submissions, uploads of multiple release candidates 
through various stages, and the writing of a new system in openstack-pkg-tools.
He also backported python-libvirt, python-setuptools, and some needed 
JavaScript packages. The OpenStack Juno packages were all uploaded and ready by the
day of the upstream release.
</p>

<p>
Raphaël Hertzog <a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2014/11/05/my-free-software-activities-in-october-2014/">updated</a>
his free software activities for the month of October
with packaging work towards the upcoming Jessie freeze, bug fixes for Publican, 
the first point release of Django 1.7.1 to unstable, and package sponsorship.
Work on the Distro Tracker continued, along with a request for others to 
<a href="https://tracker.debian.org/docs/contributing.html">contribute</a> to the project with plenty of
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/tracker.debian.org">easy bugs to fix</a>. All of the Distro
Tracker instances he manages are now running Django which he opted to make 
mandatory.

<p>
Hideki Yamane <a href="http://henrich-on-debian.blogspot.de/2014/10/open-source-conference-2014-tokyofall.html">blogged</a>
about the Open Source Conference 2014 Tokyo/Fall. Over
1,500 attendees participated over two days at the event which focused on FOSS. 
The <a href="https://tokyodebian.alioth.debian.org/">Tokyo area Debian study group</a>
maintained a booth, giving out fliers, DVDs and
information. In the Debian community session Nobuhiro Iwamatsu spoke
about Debian 8 "Jessie".

<p>
The <a href="$(HOME)/users/">Who's using Debian</a>
page lists Educational, Commercial, Government and
non-profit organisations that use Debian. Over the course of time the page
has collected a few stale entries that need to be removed or updated in order

<toc-add-entry name="JessRemoved">Jessie removals/updates</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Matthias Klumpp shared via his blog
<a href="http://blog.tenstral.net/2014/11/the-state-of-appstreamgnome-software-in-debian-jessie.html">the state of AppStream/GNOME-Software</a> in 
Debian Jessie. When GNOME was updated to 3.14, the normal functionality for 
update notifications was moved from gnome-settings-daemon to GNOME-Software. 
As GNOME-Software requires additional integration work by the 
distributors, GNOME systems are currently without update notifications as <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/">AppStream</a> metadata is 
not yet available in Debian and its full integration to Jessie has been 
postponed though with an option to include some metadata for GNOME and KDE to 
use via normal .deb packages. 
All is not lost as GNOME-Software is in unstable, but because it uses
<a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/software/appstream/docs/">offline-updates</a>
by default, which don't work well yet in Debian, it currently
has an RC bug, preventing it from entering Testing.
<q>We need a way forward to bring update-notifications back, and there is
currently work going on to do that. For all Debian users: Please be patient 
while we resolve the situation. For all developers: If you would like to help, 
please contact me or Laurent Bigonville, there are some tasks
which could use some help.</q>
On the Xfce front, Debian will soon have a new pk-update-icon package, which is
currently in NEW. That will resolve the situation there.
This situation does not affect KDE which uses Apper, which covers all its
update-notification needs. 
</p>

<p>
Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer of the <a href="https://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/">Debian QT/KDE Team</a>
<a href="http://perezmeyer.blogspot.de/2014/11/early-announce-qt4-removal-in-jessie1.html">gave
an early warning</a> of the removal of Qt4 for Debian Stretch (Jessie+1). Qt4 has been deprecated 
since the release of Qt5 on December 19, 2012, almost 2 years ago now.
While the team did support bug-fix-only releases, upstream has announced they
will end support for Qt4 in 2015, which means from that point on bug fixes
for Jessie will require a special effort. As Qt5 is available the decision
to no longer support Qt4 was made. As there is still a lot of software that 
relies on using Qt4 and to ease the transition there is a backport for Wheezy 
for Qt5.
