S.M. Floris gives an status update to <a href="http://web2unu.ro/?p=51">Muon package integration with apt-listbugs</a>:
apt-listbugs will warn users when installing packages if those packages have
serious, grave, or critical bugs. The muon package is available in the
<a href="https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/pkg-kde/kde-extras/muon.git/">Git repository for the muon package on Alioth</a>

Ian S. Donnelly takes us through his 4 week experience and process of
implementing a Three-Way merge algorithm for Elektra KeySets in C++ towards the
<a href="http://community.libelektra.org/wp/?author=2">kdb merge tool</a>.

Andrew Schurman shares his latest update on the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2014/06/msg00088.html">Java Project
Dependency Builder</a> which aims to check all of the dependencies in a project

decision that the Libravatar project made to outsource much of its maintenance
burden to Debian by using system packages for almost everything.</li>

entire historical Debian source code from archives to current and
experimental. Users can browse or search source packages online through the
web instance or use Debsources via its <a href="http://sources.debian.net/doc/api/">API</a></li>
<li><a href="https://summit.debconf.org/debconf14/meeting/5/a-glimpse-into-a-systemd-future/">A glimpse into a systemd future</a>

<toc-add-entry name="Deb_GLIBC">Debian is moving (back) to GLIBC</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Five years ago Debian moved from using GLIBC to the EGLIBC fork as the standard
C library. Now that course of action is being reversed and <a href="http://blog.aurel32.net/175">Debian is switching
back to GLIBC</a> due to the demise of the EGLIBC project and <a href="https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2012-03/msg01038.html">the dissolution of
the GLIBC steering committee</a>. With the GLIBC committee gone, GLIBC became 
open for peer review, shared repositories, removal of the ports/ directories,
 and has had most of the important EGLIBC features merged back into it. The 
new glibc package is available in experimental.

secure. If you want to learn about the challenges faced by Tails, and how
you can be part of the solution, this open event will be an intense mix of
teaching, drawing, coding, sharing, learning and celebrating, supported by
Debian, IRILL, Mozilla and the Tor project.
