(CeSViMa), which is part of the
<a href="http://www.upm.es/internacional">Technical University of Madrid</a> and
houses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magerit">Magerit</a>, one of the
most powerful supercomputers in Spain, has chosen Debian as

<toc-add-entry name="debconf">DebConf, past and future</toc-add-entry>

<p>
While the local DebConf team is well into the preparation of 
<a href="http://debconf14.debconf.org/">DebConf14</a>
which will take place in Portland, Oregon, USA during 23–31 August 2014,
the DebConf committee decided during their last meeting that DebConf15,
the 16th annual Debian Conference,
<a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf15/rh_dc15-in-germany-dc13-final-report-20140309.dc">will
be hosted in Germany</a>. Details about
location and date will be announced in the coming months.
A dedicated <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debconf15-team/">mailing list</a>
has been created for the organisation and those interested are welcome to
subscribe and join the discussion.

Furthermore, the 32-page final report for
<a href="http://debconf13.debconf.org/">DebConf13</a>
in Vaumarcus, Switzerland, is now
<a href="http://media.debconf.org/dc13/report/DebConf13-final-report.en.pdf">available</a>.
It provides interesting facts about the organisation of the event and the
experiences of participants.

<toc-add-entry name="vote">Upcoming votes in the Debian Project: DPL elections and a code of conduct</toc-add-entry>

<p>Kurt Roeckx, <a href="$(HOME)/devel/secretary">Debian project secretary</a>,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00000.html">opened</a>
the project leader elections. This year, two candidates have nominated themselves:
<a href="$(HOME)/vote/2014/platforms/lucas">Lucas Nussbaum</a>, current DPL, and
<a href="$(HOME)/vote/2014/platforms/neilm">Neil McGovern</a>.
During the campaign candidates will answer questions on the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote">debian-vote mailing list</a>
until March 30, after which Debian Members will have two weeks to send their votes.
</p>

<p>
Kurt also
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00006.html">announced</a>
that a general resolution has been started about a code of conduct,
initiated by Wouter Verhelst.
The debate about the text proposed can be followed on the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote">debian-vote mailing list</a>.
More information is available on the
<a href="$(HOME)/vote/2014/vote_002">web page of this vote</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Debian project uses the <a href="$(HOME)/vote">Condorcet method for its
elections</a>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="bits-dpl">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Lucas Nussbaum sent his
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00001.html">monthly
report of DPL activities for the end of January and February 2014</a>.

Lucas mentioned the ongoing work by Stefano Zacchiroli,
the <a href="http://sfconservancy.org/">Software Freedom Conservancy</a> and
<a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">SPI</a> to offer Debian contributors the
possibility to transfer the copyright of their contributions to a
<q>trusted</q> organisation.

Lucas also forwarded to <a href="http://france.debian.net/">Debian France</a>,
<a href="https://debian.ch/">Debian.ch</a> and
<a href="http://www.ffis.de/">FFIS</a> the list of
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/TrustedOrganizationCriteria">evaluation
criteria</a> to become a trusted organisation, authorised to
accept and hold assets for Debian.

In <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00002.html">another
message</a>, Lucas appointed Nicolas Dandrimont and Sylvestre Ledru as admins
for Debian participation in the Google Summer of Code 2014.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="bits-security">Bits from the Security Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Moritz Muehlenhoff sent
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00004.html">some
bits from the Security Team</a>.
The Security Team met on the first weekend of February at the
Linux Hotel in Essen.
They discussed several improvements for the Debian security tracker and
the security release workflow, as well as changes in the security archive, such
as the possibility to allow maintainers not part of the Security Team to
release security updates on their own through a mechanism similar to the
procedure to grant upload privileges to Debian Maintainers.
Distribution hardening was also mentioned: currently, more than 95% of
security-sensitive packages and packages with priority standard or above
are hardened using dpkg-buildflags.
Last but not least, the Security Team considers that at the moment it seems
likely that an extended security support timespan for Squeeze is possible.
The plan is to go ahead, and provide updates for a <q>long term support</q> for Squeeze
in a separate suite where everyone in the Debian keyring can
upload in order to minimise bottlenecks and allow contributions by
all interested parties. The team needs help to make this effort sustainable.
Anyone interested in helping with an extended security support is invited to contact
<a href="mailto:team@security.debian.org">the Security Team</a>.

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2014/02/apt-get_install_how-can-i-help/">blogged</a>
about the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/how-can-i-help"><tt>how-can-i-help</tt> package</a>
and how useful it can be for Debian contributors searching for opportunities to
help the project.
</p>

<p>
Bill Allombert and Stéphane Blondon have improved
the website <a href="https://popcon.debian.org">popcon.debian.org</a>,
presenting the gathered results of Debian's
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/popularity-contest">popularity contest</a>.
In particular it now uses a style matching the
<a href="$(HOME)">main Debian website</a>.
</p>


<p>
Enrico Zini
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00008.html">announced</a>
that the <a href="https://sso.debian.org">Debian Single SignOn</a> service can now
use not only the credentials of official
Debian Members, but also those from <a
href="https://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a>, the Debian sourceforge.
At the moment, contributors with an Alioth account are able to log in
to <a href="https://contributors.debian.org">contributors.debian.org</a>
with their Alioth password, and have access to detailed information about
their contributions. 
This will be extended to other Debian web services in the future.
</p>

<p>
Gunnar Wolf
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/03/msg00003.html">announced</a>
that the Debian keyring maintainers no longer consider 1024 bit long DSA
cryptographic keys to be trustable. They are asking Debian Members and
Maintainers still using this kind of key to move to a stronger key
(4096 bit RSA keys are recommended) as soon as possible.
