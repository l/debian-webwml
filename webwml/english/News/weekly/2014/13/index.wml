<toc-add-entry name="rtbits">Bits from the release team and Jessie's freeze</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Adam D. Barrat published
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/09/msg00002.html">some
release team news</a>. The window for new transitions closed on September
5, and ongoing transitions should be completed as quickly as possible. The final
architecture check was completed in mid-September, and the current agreed list
of architectures for Jessie is amd64, armel and armhf, i386,
kfreebsd-amd64 and kfreebsd-i386, mips, mipsel, powerpc and s390x. The final
decision for kFreeBSD ports, for which human resources is a concern, and arm64
and ppc64el ports, which made good progress and have strong support, is expected
in the very beginning of November.
The freeze for Jessie is scheduled for November 5. In order to get their
packages into Jessie before the freeze, maintainers of packages should take into
account the fact that starting from October 5, the migration delay for all
packages uploaded to unstable to enter Jessie will be 10 days. 
</p>

<p>
On a related topic,
Lucas Nussbaum asks, <q>Will the packages you rely on be part of Debian Jessie?</q>, 
with a helpful <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=837">series of steps</a> you can use to be prepared.
Please also read the <a href="https://release.debian.org/jessie/freeze_policy.html">Freeze Policy for Jessie</a> to ensure you are in fact ready, 
prepared, and aware of the procedures taking place.

The annual Debian developer meeting took place in Portland, Oregon, 23 to 31
August 2014. <a href="http://debconf14.debconf.org/">DebConf14</a> attendees
participated in talks, discussions, workshops and programming sessions. Video
teams captured a lot of the main talks and discussions for streaming for
interactive attendees and for the <a
href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/">Debian video
archive</a>. Between the video, presentations, and handouts the coverage came
from the attendees in blogs, posts, and project updates of which a few
have been gathered for your reading over on the <a
href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf14/wrap-up.dc">DebConf blog</a>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="DebConf15-announced">DebConf15 dates are set, come and join us!</toc-add-entry>

<toc-add-entry name="openpgp">Discussions about OpenPGP</toc-add-entry>

<p>
A certain number of interesting blog posts about cryptography were published
recently in the Debian community. Simon Josefsson advocated
on his blog
<a href="http://blog.josefsson.org/2014/08/26/the-case-for-short-openpgp-key-validity-periods/">the
case for short OpenPGP key validity periods</a>.
Bernhard R. Link posted <a href="http://blog.brlink.eu/index.html#i68">his
point of view about where expiry dates for cryptographic keys are useful, and where
they are not</a>.
Gunnar Wolf <a href="http://gwolf.org/node/3950">summarised on his blog</a>
several cryptography-related discussions which occurred during
DebConf14. As a Debian keyring maintainer, he gave a presentation at DebConf together with
Daniel Kahn Gillmor and Jonathan McDowell
about the status of the Debian OpenPGP keyring, after which it was decided to  
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/08/msg00015.html">remove
keys shorter than 2048 bits from the Debian keyring by the end of the year</a>.
One month after this presentation, Gunnar posted on his blog <a
href="http://gwolf.org/node/3951">some nice graphs</a> about the evolution of the
Debian keyring. In the meantime, Clint Adams
<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2014/09/msg00137.html">presented
some statistics about connectivity in the Debian keyring</a>, before and after
the DebConf14 key signing party.

<toc-add-entry name="LTS-Reports">Long Term Support (LTS) Reports</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Freexian's offer to bring together funding from multiple companies in order to 
sponsor the work of multiple developers on <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Debian LTS</a> also required
paid contributors to provide a public monthly report of their paid work.
In July and August of this year Freexian sponsored 
<a href="http://layer-acht.org/thinking/blog/20140819-lts-july-2014/">Holger Levsen</a> and
<a href="http://blog.alteholz.eu/2014/07/my-debian-activities-in-july-2014/">Thorsten
Akteholz</a>, who have both reported on their progress in July.
While Freexian has not reached its minimal goal of 
funding the equivalent of a half-time position which is reflected in the results, the 
program has learned a few things such as that paid contributors handle almost 70%
of the updates, and counting only on volunteers would not have worked. It is
also worthy of note that quite a few companies that promised help have 
not delivered on the promised help yet, though that should not distract from 
the fact that this project wouldn’t exist without the support of multiple 
companies and organisations who did step up.

Distro Tracker has Python 3 compatibility, and the full test suite passes with Python 3.4

<toc-add-entry name="Clang3.5.0">Rebuild of Debian using Clang</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Sylvestre Ledru blogged about an updated <a
href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/2014/09/11/rebuild-of-debian-using-clang-3-5">rebuild
of Debian using Clang</a>. Clang 3.5.0 has been released, and has seen a <a
href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/media/blogs/sylvestre/evolution-clang-sept-2014.png?mtime=1410087335">marked
decrease</a> in build failures  
from 2,040 packages (9.5%) to 1,261 (5.7%). Upstream fixes started
with bugs such as <a
href="http://clang.debian.net/status.php?version=3.5.0&amp;key=CONFLICTING_TYPE">conflicting
types</a> and <a
href="http://clang.debian.net/status.php?version=3.5.0&amp;key=DEFAULT_CONSTRUCTOR">changes
of the default constructor</a>,
then moved to a different parallel approach of focusing on improving GCC 
compatibility with a warning category instead of errors.
