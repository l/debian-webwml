<toc-add-entry name="coc">Debian members vote to accept a code of conduct</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Just after the election of the Debian Project Leader, Debian members were
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/04/msg00004.html">called
by Kurt Roeckx</a>, Debian secretary, to vote on a general resolution for a
code of conduct proposed by Wouter Verhelst.
This
<a href="$(HOME)/code_of_conduct">code of conduct</a>
promoting respect, good faith, collaboration, conciseness
and openness
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/20140428213635.GA10933@roeckx.be">has been
adopted by Debian Members</a>. It can be modified via further general
resolutions.

More details about the results of this vote can be found on the
<a href="$(VOTE)/2014/vote_002">page of the website dedicated
to this general resolution</a>.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="debconf14">Registration open for DebConf14</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce that registration is now open
for DebConf14, which will take place in Portland, Oregon, USA from Saturday,
August 23 to Sunday, August 31, 2014. As in previous years, three different
registration options will be available: <q>Basic</q>, <q>Professional</q>
and <q>Corporate</q>. To request food, accommodation or travel sponsorship,
you must be registered by Thursday, May 15, 2014. After this date,
registrations will still be accepted, but requests for sponsorship
will not. For more detailed information about how to register,
please see the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/04/msg00010.html">separate
announcement from the DebConf team</a>.
</p>
<p>
In past years, DebConf has been preceded by a separate DebCamp event,
where developers can gather before the conference and collaborate in person
on Debian. This year the team is trying a different approach, with a
longer conference period allowing for blocks of talks to be mixed with
blocks of coding time throughout the week. More information about the
schedule will be made available when the Call for Papers is posted in
the near future.
Furthermore, as mentioned in the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/04/msg00007.html">
latest bits from the DPL mail</a>, there is also an opportunity for Debian
teams to organise sprints around DebConf. Teams who are interested should
follow the process documented on the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/HowTo">wiki page</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="sparcremoved">SPARC removed from Jessie</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Philipp Kern
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/04/msg00012.html">announced</a>
the removal of the SPARC port from testing, as of April 26. The main reasons
were lack of porter commitment, problems with the toolchain and continued
stability issues. The fate of SPARC in unstable has not been decided yet; it
may be removed unless people commit to working on it. Discussion about this
should take place on <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=745938">bug report #745938</a>.
SPARC support was officially introduced in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (code name
<q>slink</q>) back in March 1999 and was featured in eight releases.

Tony Mancill
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/53589FC6.2060805@debian.org">reported</a>
about his attendance at the
<a href="http://www.eeliveshow.com/sanjose/">EE Live/Embedded Systems Conference</a>,
which took place in San Jose, California, on March 31—April 3, and showed the
increasing relevance of Debian in embedded systems:
Bunnie Huang's keynote introduced the
<a href="http://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=3657">Novena open-hardware laptop</a>,
which
<a href="https://www.crowdsupply.com/kosagi/novena-open-laptop">will
be shipped with Debian preinstalled</a>;
Ryan Kuester, one of the developers of the Debian-based
<a href="http://www.pragmatux.net/">Pragmatux</a>, presented
<q>Running Android atop a proper embedded Linux</q>;
and David Reyna presented the
<a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org/about">Yocto</a>
<a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/ref-manual.html">Project</a>,
which supports both .rpm and .deb-based package management for embedded targets,
and lists Debian as a supported development workstation environment.

<toc-add-entry name="release-bits">Bits from the Release Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Regular security support for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0, <q>squeeze</q>,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/2014/msg00082.html">
will be terminated</a> on May 31, 2014. A new suite named <q>squeeze-lts</q>
and containing only two architectures, i386 and amd64, will be made available
with support extended until February 2016 to provide a five year support cycle.

A reminder that the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/10/msg00004.html">
scheduled freeze date</a> for Jessie has been set for six months from now
on Wednesday, November 5, 2014.

In the same message, Niels Thykier reported on the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2014/05/msg00000.html">Release
Team's architecture meeting</a>, held on April 12, 2014, about the status of
the architectures and considering their suitability for Jessie.

Recursive auto-removals have returned, with warnings to the
maintainers of the involved packages prior to removal. 
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="gnome-systemd">Bits from the systemd + GNOME sprint</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Jordi Mallach <a href="https://lists.debian.org/20140501232614.GA29827@oskuro.net">sent
bits</a> from the Debian sprint where the Debian GNOME core team and systemd Debian
maintainer gathered in Antwerp, Belgium. Over two days, the ten participants
discussed a variety of topics to do with systemd and GNOME integration in
Debian. After some improvement in the packaging workflow for systemd, version
208 of systemd has been uploaded to experimental.

The GNOME team initiated several transitions, improved the
<a href="http://www.0d.be/debian/debian-gnome-3.12-status.html">status
of GNOME 3.12 in Debian</a>,
and discussed the feasibility of having Debian Jessie shipped with 3.14.
The participants also jointly discussed how to configure and start display
managers, and may have come to a working solution to this problem,
which is complicated by the number of packages providing display
managers and init systems.

They also used this opportunity to sign new, stronger GnuPG keys in order to
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/20140303181359.GA68761@gwolf.org">help the
effort to abandon older and weaker keys</a>.

The participants thank the sponsors, most notably INUITS, which provided the
venue, and Debian and its donors for covering the travel expenses
for five of the attendees. A few of the attendees were kindly sponsored by
their employers.
