<p><strong>No Progeny Debian Anymore?</strong> In a recent <a
href="http://www.progeny.com/archive/debian/">announcement</a> Progeny
Linux Systems publically stated that they ceased development on their
Progeny Debian product. The primary motivation for this decision is
Progeny's desire for proper convergence with Debian. It has been said
that Progeny Debian was an amazing product, with a modern installer
and hardware detection. It was a boxed product, meant as base for NOW
(Network of Workstations), which was already buried earlier this
year. For all users of Progeny Debian, a migration path to Debian
Woody will be provided.</p>

<p><strong>Updated Debian Installation Documents?</strong> The <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/install">Debian Installation
Manual</a> has been translated into 11 languages. However, while
documentation is a difficult issue for programmers, translation of documents
is even more difficult. Many translations are not up-to-date anymore, and
even the original may lack important information. If you would like to help,
please check out the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/boot-floppies/documentation/">current version</a>
and provide patches to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Xmodmap On X Session Startup Deprecated.</strong> Branden Robinson
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0110/msg00072.html">informed</a> us
that the automatic usage of xmodmap on X session startup is now deprecated.
The main reason for this is that unpredictable things can happen if both the
system and the user are using Xmodmap files, and sometimes the user doesn't
even have to have one for the keyboard to get screwed up by unintended side
effects. Please read Branden's mail if you are running testing or unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Small Problem with XFree86 4.1.0-7.</strong> Branden also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0110/msg00004.html">told</a> us about a
problem with a very obvious effect in packages for XFree86 4.1.0-7. The bug
consists of erroneous quoting of a shell variable in the file
<code>/etc/X11/Xsession.d/99xfree86-common_start</code>.  This problem was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0110/msg00004.html">reported</a>
on the debian-devel and debian-x mailing lists
shortly after 4.1.0-7 was released.
There is no need to tell him nor to file more bugs.  Latest News:
Version 4.1.0-8 has already been uploaded.</p>

<p><strong>Release Notes.</strong> The next version of Debian GNU/Linux will
be 3.0 (sorry folks, but the Hurd doesn't seem to be ready for release yet).
Rob Bradford is preparing <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~robster/docs/releasenotes/i386.en.html/">Release
Notes</a> for Woody already.  As you can see only the structure is in place,
the purpose of this draft is to discuss exactly what we want to mention in the
release notes.  Any ideas for structure/content would be much appreciated.
Joey Hess came up with an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg01173.html">impressive
list</a> of news items for woody.  Please provide ideas and content to <a
href="mailto:robster@debian.org">Robster</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MPEG Player Running In A Text-Console.</strong> Uwe Herrman sent an
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/116359">Intent to Package</a> (ITP) for an
MPEG player which is running in a text-console.  The program uses aalib for
displaying the videos.  A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg01393.html">thread</a> on
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> mailing
list started discussing the usefulness of such a program.  However, usefulness
of software is not a requirement for it to be packaged.  There are certain
reasons for people preferring this player in favour of one running under X: no
working X, no desire switching to X, demoing on an exhibition etc.  If it was
really useless, it wouldn't be written.</p>

<p><strong>Boot-Floppies 3.0.16.</strong> Adam di Carlo sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0110/msg00723.html">note</a> about
preparation of new boot-floppies.  Version 3.0.15 has some flaws which prevents
building on the sparc architecture.  New boot-floppies should be built upon a
Linux kernel which has recent security issues fixed.  Unfortunately,
this implies the need for new pcmcia-modules-* packages as well.  Even if
modules should be binary-compatible between kernel-subreleases, packages
dependencies prevent their installation.</p>

<p><strong>Appointing the Debian Security Secretary.</strong> The Debian
Security Team <a href="$(HOME)/News/2001/20011017">appointed</a>
Matt Zimmerman and Noah Meyerhans as Security Secretaries.  They hope to be
able to provide an even better service to the users in reacting to security
problems.  Adding more people to the team who will be able to check security
problems and review code should improve Debian Security significantly.</p>

<p><strong>Talking about Non-Free Software.</strong> Last week there was
a report that RMS was <a 
href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-10-19-011-20-NW-CY-GN">\
asking</a> that the GNOME Summary not include mentions of non-free software.
Since DWN, like the GNOME Summary, reports on a project that is primarily 
devoted to Free Software, we thought we'd explain our policy in this area.
Generally, we try to promote Free Software and non-free software doesn't
get a lot of coverage in DWN. However, there are still some important 
non-free packages for Debian, and from time to time we'll have some coverage
of them. That doesn't mean that we're promoting non-free software, simply
that we have to recognize that we're not 100% of the way there yet and
we'd be doing a disservice to our readers by pretending that non-free software
simply doesn't exist. We also recognize that many Debian users are new to
Linux, and may not understand or care about the political issues behind
software licensing. We feel that our time is best spent clarifying those
issues and trying to help users understand why the political issues behind
software licensing are important, rather than just ignoring non-free
software. While we respect all of the work that RMS has done, and it's a 
lot, we don't think that refusing to talk about non-free software is the
answer.</p> 

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages List.</strong> Colin Watson opened the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2001/debian-qa-200110/msg00168.html">\
discussion</a> of starting a mailing list for tracking orphaned packages
to take some of the noise off of the Debian Quality Assurance mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>NewbieDoc Report.</strong> It's been a little while since
we had a report from the NewbieDoc folks, here's the latest from Will
Trillich.  With school in session, the NewbieDoc project has taken a
back seat. Many members have their noses stuck into various textbooks
in preparation for upcoming exams.  But Jesse Goerz, NewbieDocMeister
Extraordinaire, has been working hard to implement some
internationalization layers.  If your browser requests Español, you
should see Español, right?  Soon, we'll be able to say "NewbieDoc
isn't just in English, not any more!" Go, Jesse, go!</p>
