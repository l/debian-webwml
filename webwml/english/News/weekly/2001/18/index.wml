<p><strong>Base bugs and the freeze.</strong> Anthony Towns has posted
yet another base bugs <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0107/msg00011.html">
report</a>.  It says that we have most of the base bugs fixed.  The
architectures which will be released seems to be ARM, i386, m68k,
PowerPC, Sparc, HPPA and IA-64.  Alpha doesn't have boot-floppies yet,
while mips and mipsel are being considered.  We also need to decide on
crypto in main.  The process concerning this has a deadline August
4th.  If everything goes better than planned then we will have woody
released before Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>Mips and mipsel for woody?</strong> We hear interesting and
promising news from our mips ports.  Henning Heinold has reported a
partial <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0106/msg00295.html">success
story</a> for boot-floppies on a MIPS machine (big endian,
binary-mips).  The installer is loaded via NFS-Root.  Karsten Merker
and Martin 'Joey' Schulze have <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0107/msg00081.html">managed</a>
to get a DECstation (little endian, binary-mipsel) boot the Debian
installer through a kernel with an appended ramdisk which is loaded
via TFTP.  The porters hope that these steps classify for an inclusion
in woody.  Here is Karsten's <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0107/msg00087.html">report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Useful utilities on debian-devel.</strong> Small script
gems keep popping out on debian-devel.  You have probably su'ed to
root in order to run an X program and then discovered that you only
got a message like <code>xterm Xt error: Can't open display:
0:0</code>.  Then you got around it in some way, either by running
<code>xhost</code>, or <code>ssh -X -l root localhost</code>.  Now,
Francois Gouget has made a tool which solves the problem.  It's called
<code><a href="http://fgouget.free.fr/sux/">sux</a></code>
(su-with-x). Here is his <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg00008.html">announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsoring problems.</strong> For people who are in the New
Maintainer Queue, there is a way to get a package into Debian.  That
is to get a sponsor, who checks the package and uploads it on behalf
of the person being sponsored.  Lately, there have been some problems
with developers not checking the packages well enough.  As
usual, this spawned off a big discussion on debian-devel, and Anthony
Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg01342.html">
proposed</a> a way for the sponsor to become more involved with the
packages she is sponsoring.</p>

<p><strong>Say cheese.  Or APT.</strong> Debian has the best packaging
system around, but not everybody knows which utility to use when.  Is
it <code>dpkg --reconfigure</code> or
<code>dpkg-reconfigure</code>?  (It's the latter, but not to be confused
with <code>dpkg --configure</code>.)  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg01614.html">Joe
Wreschnig</a> wrote a small frontend to apt, called <a
href="http://www.sacredchao.net/software/feta/">FETA</a> (Front End To
Apt), which looks cute.  </p>

<p><strong>Quality of bug reports.</strong> Anthony Towns has posted
a little <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0107/msg00058.html">complaint</a>
about the quality of bug reports.  "If we get more and more users, or
more and more newbie users, or more and more users who want an
<em>information appliance</em> instead of a computer, I can only see
this getting worse."  This seems to be a result of the increased
popularity of Debian GNU and our encouragement to send bug reports
while tools like bug(1) and reportbug(1) make it quite easy to submit
new bug reports, even it the problem is <a
href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=pebkac">PEBKAC</a>.
The discussion quickly lead into technical proposals to cope with the
number of bug reports and their classification.  Matt Zimmerman came
up with a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0107/msg00060.html">bugzilla-like
proposal</a> (even with a flow chart), while Anthony <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0107/msg00062.html">introduced</a>
new tags.</p>

<p><strong>Size of the Debian Archive.</strong> Marcelo Magallon has
studied the size of the Debian archive for over one month and has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-0107/msg00000.html">summarized</a>
it on a <a
href="http://auric.debian.org/~mmagallo/archive-size.png">graphic</a>.
It shows a steady increase in size of the Debian archive.  New
architectures which are catching up quickly like S/390, HP PA-RISC and
both MIPS architectures, let the size increase fast.</p>
