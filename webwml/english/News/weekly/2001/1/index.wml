<p>
<b>Happy new year and welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News. Debian Weekly News
has now been summarizing the events of the Debian world for two full years. 
A <a href="../../2000/timeline">timeline</a> of the most important stories
of 2000</a> is available as a special supplement to this issue.

***TODO: finish, reorder***

<p>
<b>Discussion volume has been light on the mailing lists over the
holidays</b>, with many developers on vacation. Lots of users were on vacation
too, and wanted to temproarily unsubscribe from debian-user to prevent email
piling up while they were away. However, several of them were
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0012/msg03526.html">unable to
unsubscribe</a>. Brian Moore tracked down the problem to an 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0012/msg03777.html">invalid
threshold</a> that had been set in SmartList's configuration, and the problem
was eventually
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02198.html">corrected</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The move from /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc</b> is proving long and slow. Joey
Hess <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02191.html">
calculated</a> that unless 6 packages are converted every day from now until
woody is frozen, the first stage of the transition will not be finished in 
time for woody, and the full transition would be pushed off into the far 
future. Though this did spur some uploads, nowhere near six packages a day 
are being converted. Ben Collins 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02196.html">
pointed out</a> that an alternative is to "<i>reevaluate this decision
based on the fact that the bug in dpkg that forced this implementation (as 
opposed to a clean /usr/doc symlink to share/doc) has been gone for awhile
now</i>". He proposed a single transition script that would move the
remaining contents of /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc and symlink the two
directories. According to Ben, all of his systems have been set up this way
"<i>without any errors or missing files</i>". Santiago Vila 
<a href="mail#1">worries</a> about "<i>risking the integrity of the system by
complex scripts</i>"; in the meantime development of such a script is under
way (20010101150514.G17084@kitenet.net), though it is not clear if it will be 
used.

<p>
We're beginning to learn what life with the testing
distribution will be like. Developers now need to keep track of what
versions of their packages are in testing, and it's proving to be rather
hard to figure out why an updated package is not being accepted into
testing. Currently this involves reading the 
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/~ajt/update_excuses.html">"update
excuses" file</a> and trying to guess what it
means. (20001223040403.A30564@lina.inka.de) *** MORE STUFF: "Questions
about testing" ***

<b>Wishlist features for dpkg</b> turned out to be the topic of this thread,
although it didn't
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02277.html">start 
out</a> that way. The features people would like to see added to some future
version of dpkg include the ability to easily
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02297.html">rollback
upgrades</a>, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02304.html">
relocatable packages</a>, installation of
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02344.html">multiple 
versions</a> of a package at one time, entirely 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02354.html">eliminating
maintainer scripts</a> so installing a package does not run code as root,
and many other difficult things. It's not just all daydreaming though -- 
dpkg (Pine.LNX.4.21.0012241350340.8887-100000@yakko) might have
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0012/msg02311.html">binary
database cache files</a> as early as version 1.9.

<p>
<b>Just in time for Christmas, three new security fixes were released:</b> a
<a href="../../../../security/2000/20001225">temporary file attack</a>
against dialog, <a href="../../../../2000/20001225a">several 
vulverabilities in stunnel</a>, and <a href="../../../../2000/20001225b">two
gnupg problems</a> were all fixed on December 25th.
