<p><strong>Fixing GPM Bugs.</strong> Zephaniah E. Hull worked on GPM recently,
fighting against broken mice which in turn broke mice protocols and send more
characters than expected.  Zephaniah publically <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01568.html">asked</a> for
bug reports about problems with GPM and PS/2 mice.  Even if these bugs are
filed as bugs already, please read his mail and provide all information he
needs.</p>

#Are the mice broken, or are they mice with poor implementations of
#protocol?

<p><strong>Quality of Ximian's Debian Packages.</strong> Eric Van
Buggenhaut was playing with Ximian's Debian Packages, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01212.html">trying</a>
to get Ximian's version of gdm compile.  His fears include the
possibility that some of Ximian's packages could make it into Debian,
even though they lack proper maintenance resulting in: no Build-depends, 
no clean target in debian/rules and broken debian/conf-files.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Building of non-free Packages?</strong> Adrian Bunk
started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01448.html">discussion</a>
about discrimination of non-free packages.  It was noticed that Debians Build
Daemons (buildd) don't seem to automatically build non-free packages for all
architectures, resulting in difficulties getting non-free packages entering
the testing stage.  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01468.html">Richard
Braakman</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01483.html">James Troup</a>
(ftp master and maintainer of nearly half a dozen buildds) explained why
buildds can't automatically build non-free packages.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze in Progress.</strong> The freeze for Woody is coming closer
which will definitively lead into a released Woody. Anthony Towns is
reviewing the situation of testing/unstable and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01617.html">reports</a>
problems which the maintainer of these affected packages have to solve in
order to get their packages updated in testing.  People who care about Woody
should read the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> mailing list
frequently.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretive Guidelines Regarding DFSG 3.</strong> Branden Robinson
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0111/msg00100.html">proposed</a>
an interpretation to the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a> clause 3 that
covers modifications and derived works.  His proposal reflects the current
situation about certain parts of packages are unmodifiable (e.g. license texts
and auxiliary material).  Such auxiliary material was introduced by the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation
License</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Quick Reference for Debian.</strong> Osamu Aoki started a new
document named <a href="http://qref.sourceforge.net/quick/">Quick Reference
for Debian GNU/Linux</a> which is distributed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation
License</a>.  This document is mostly a collection of scripts which can be
used as quick reference.  It covers many aspects of system administration
through shell command examples and configuration files.  Many issues were
picked up from the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/">debian-user</a> mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze Update.</strong> Anthony Towns sent an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0111/msg00016.html">update</a>
of the freeze process.  After December 9th, no changes (beyond minimal security
backports, or incredibly special exceptions) will be made to base packages in
Woody.  After December 9th, standard packages which have been dropped from Woody
won't be reinstated.  See our last issue for details.</p>

<p><strong>LDP Documents in non-free?</strong> David Merrill, the Linux
Documentation Project coordinator, mailed the Debian Project recently with <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0112/msg00052.html">concerns</a>
about LDP documents (affecting packages doc-linux-html and doc-linux-text,
plus the various translations) having to be moved to non-free.  Unfortunately
many LDP documents are encumbered by distribution requirements.  Many authors,
however, are cooperating with David and are relicensing their work.</p>

<p><strong>Report from International Linux Kongreﬂ 2001.</strong> The Debian
Project had the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/events/2001/1128-linuxkongress">opportunity</a> to
run a booth and a developers workshop during International Linux Kongreﬂ 2001
which was held at the University of Twente last week.  Joey wrote a <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxKongress2001/report.html">\
trip report</a> describing some details of the meeting.  More than a dozen
Debian people joined the conference, were talking with each other about
various topics and exchanged GnuPG fingerprints.  And, of cource, evening
meetings were always fun to attend.</p>

<p><strong>Packages from NSA's SE Linux.</strong> Russell Coker spent some
time <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01761.html">\
investigating</a> SE Linux and assembling a couple of <a
href="http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/">preliminary packages</a>.  In order to
benefit from the changes made to SE Linux you'll first need to have a kernel
with extra functionality booted.  Russell has a patch prepared already.  </p>

<p><strong>Free Software in Russian Companies.</strong> A non-public <a
href="http://www.debian.org/events/2001/1128-business">conference</a>
targeting Free Software in the Business world was held in Moscow at the end of
November.  Peter Novodvorsky and Wartan Hachaturow from Debian attended the
conference and gave a talk about Debian.</p>

<p><strong>One Small Step for Debian...</strong> We normally don't do 
product announcements, but we thought it was worth mentioning that HP's
new line of Blade servers will debut with Linux before Windows versions
or HP-UX. Naturally, one of the distros available is 
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/53/23178.html">Debian</a>.
Unfortunately, the first models won't ship until January. Too late for
stocking-stuffers, but just in time for Valentine's...</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following new or
updated packages were added to the Debian archive since our last
issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/dhcping.html">dhcping</a> and
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/dhcpdump.html">dhcpdump</a>
-- Test a DHCP server and decode DHCP data packages.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/dtaus.html">dtaus</a>
-- Paperless money transfer with German banks on floppies.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/misc/kudzu.html">kudzu</a>
-- A hardware detecting library.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/sound/pmidi-0.9.html">pmidi</a>
-- A command line MIDI player for ALSA 0.9.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/comm/snooper.html">snooper</a>
-- Captures communication between two external serial devices.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/ghemical.html">ghemical</a>
-- A computational chemistry software package.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/wbd.html">wbd</a> --
A multicast white board application that allows you to share a virtual white board with other people running wbd.
</ul>

<p><strong>A Particularly Interesting Package...</strong> This one really
caught my eye, it's called "<a 
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/razor.html">Vipul's Razor</a>." 
It's a distributed, collaborative, spam-catching and filtering program to 
help weed out SPAM. It rates special mention because the more folks who 
use it, the more efficient it will be. Anything that helps put an end to 
SPAM is a Good Thing (TM).</p>  

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> Just one security issue to report
this week, be sure to update your systems if it affects you.

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-087">wu-ftpd</a> --
 Remote root exploit.
</ul>
