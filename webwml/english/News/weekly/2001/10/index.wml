<p> <b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
community.</p>

<p> <b>First - a new editor team for DWN.</b> Joey Hess was tired, but
a couple of people thought it would be a shame if DWN were to die, so
we asked if we might take over, and he let us.  The lucky ones are <a
href="mailto:helary@eskimo.com">Jean-Christophe Helary</a>, <a
href="mailto:jbrockmeier@earthlink.net">Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier</a> and <a
href="mailto:tfheen@debian.org">Tollef Fog Heen</a>.  Joey wants to thank the
hundreds of people who sent in mails of encouragement and thanks, and
wishes the new DWN staff well.</p>

<p><b> Since the last issue, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-announce-01/msg00002.html">2.2r3
is out</a>.</b> It fixes quite a few security and release critical
bugs: an ntp root exploit, and samba symlink problems are among those.
Some of the security updates were incorrectly built on an unstable
system, which caused some confusion.  This is fixed now.  </p>

<p><b>The boot floppies are coming along, albeit slowly.</b> There have
been some troubles relating to slang and utf8, but those should be <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0104/msg00737.html">mostly
worked out</a> now.  The boot-floppies have been translated into <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0104/msg00671.html">Danish</a>,
and we have a Gaelic translation underway.  Also, if we are to release
Woody this year, 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0104/msg00004.html">the boot-floppies
need much more help</a>.  </p>

<p><b> Ben Collins has already begun his work as Project Leader.</b>
So far, he is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0104/msg00000.html">beefing
up</a> the technical committee, and both Bdale Garbee and Wichert
Akkerman have been added to it. </p>

<p><b> On debian-devel, it has been a very busy week with long and
heated discussions</b> about whether <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0104/msg01412.html">ALL:
PARANOID</a> is a good setting to have in /etc/hosts.deny. Also there
has been some discussion related to chroot'ing BIND.  The biggest
discussion is still <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0104/msg01316.html">'kernel-{image,headers}
package bloat'</a> where Herbert Xu, Craig Sanders and Daniel Stone
(and some other people) are flaming each other.  Don't enter without
your asbestos suit.</p>

<p><b>To CSS or not to CSS.</b>  Should packages like <a
href="http://samfundet.no/~tfheen/debian/dists/woody/css/binary-i386/xine-dvd-css_0.1.2-1_i386.deb">xine-dvd-css</a>
go into main?  None of the ftp-masters want to be the one responsible
for putting it in, so what will happen is still open to discussion
(and legal advice).  Related to this is the continuous
crypto-in-main-discussion.  Hopefully, this will be resolved with a
little lawyer's help.

<p><b><a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0104/msg00016.html">dpkg
1.9 is out</a>.</b>  It fixes a lot of segfaults and adds support for
signed packages.  Also, it has new features, speedups, updated
translations, fixes for Hurd, HPPA, IA64 and SH.  There are already a
couple of bugfix releases available, which fix some of the new and
exciting bugs.  </p>

<b>Some of the new packages</b> which have made it into Debian this week are:
<a
href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/cocoon2.html">cocoon2</a>,
<a
href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/thttpd.html">thttpd</a>,
<a
href="https://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/x11/nvclock.html">nvclock</a>
and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/task-harden">task-harden</a>

<p><a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">Feedback</a> is always
appreciated</p>
