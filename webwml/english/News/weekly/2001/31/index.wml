<p><strong>Searching Bugs per Source Package.</strong> Adam Heath added the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01031.html">ability</a> to
search for bugs based on source packages to the cgi scripts that exist on <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/">http://bugs.debian.org/</a>. A source listing
contains all bugs on packages that come from that source. The easy way to
access this feature is to use a URL similar to <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/src:postgresql">http://bugs.debian.org/src:postgresql</a>.
That is "http://bugs.debian.org/src:<i>packagename</i>".
Additionally, package listings have links to other packages produced by the
same source, in addition to having a link to their source package's bug page.
Adam also added more <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg01062.html">features</a> so
you can now select the severities and bug status you want displayed. These
features are greatly appreciated by maintainers of multi-binary packages.</p>

<p><strong>Spellchecking Package Descriptions.</strong> Matt Zimmerman took
the opportunity and fine-tuned his first investigation of spelling problems in
package descriptions. His <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00974.html">\
corrections</a> resulted in a 200kB diff file for more than 1,300 (out of 8,000)
packages. Matt's mail also contains the guidelines he used for correcting these
descriptions.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Environment on top of Mac OS X?</strong> A few messages
popped up on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> mailing list
covering this.  The <a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink project</a>
wants to bring the full world of Unix <a
href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source</a> software to <a
href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/">Darwin</a> and <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>.  The project modifies and
ports the software so it will run on top of Mac OS X.  The files are made
available for download as a coherent distribution.  Fink uses Debian tools
like dpkg and apt-get to provide powerful package management for
binary packages.</p>

<p><strong>International Boot-Floppies.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0111/msg00581.html">message</a> on
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> list
requested the inclusion of Danish in the supported languages on the
internationalized root disk. We can refine the choice of languages at any
point. Right now, however, it would probably be more productive for people to
build internationalized boot-floppies and find out whether one can actually do
an install with them. <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0111/msg00583.html">Looking</a> at
the date of one translated file, several translations may be out-dated.
Translators should check their status.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and the Euro.</strong> Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0111/msg00003.html">contributed</a>
another document to the <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp">Debian
Documentation Project</a> (DDP). From January 1st, 2002, several European
countries switch to the Euro as their currency. The <a
href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-euro-support/">Debian Euro
HOWTO</a> provides comprehensive information about using the Euro symbol
with Debian. This includes configuration of the Linux text console, as well as the
X Window System. Additionally, special Euro packages were uploaded into the
experimental section (euro-support, euro-support-console and euro-support-x)
to provide easy support for the Euro.</p>

<p><strong>WNPP Overview.</strong> Bas Zoetekouw <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0111/msg00188.html">wrote</a> a script
which generates an overview of <a
href="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">Work Needed and Prospective Packages</a>
(WNPP) entries in the Debian Bug Tracking System. This
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0111/msg00192.html">report</a> ought
to help the Quality Assurance (QA) people to clean out WNPP bugs that are not
relevant anymore since nobody cares about the packages.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze Update.</strong> Anthony Towns sent in an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0111/msg00012.html">updated
report</a> about the Woody freeze process. We're almost into the last week
for uploads of base packages. If there are outstanding bugs you'd like to see
fixed, provide patches or upload now. We are also
getting into the last days for ensuring that standard and task packages get
included in the Woody release. At the moment it looks like a lot of
packages will be removed from Woody. Among these are a whole bunch of commonly
used programs like gpm, Mutt, CVS, Procmail, Apache and Mozilla. People who
can fix bugs in these packages and care about them are encouraged to send in
patches or upload fixed packages using Anthony's <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/nmus.txt">unofficial NMU guidelines</a>.

<p><strong>GNU/Hurd Hardware Compatibility Guide.</strong> If you are
thinking about running Debian GNU/Hurd, but are not quite sure if you
have hardware that will make it happy, you're in luck. James Morrison
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0111/msg00081.html">\
announced</a> a <a href="http://www.freesoftware.fsf.org/thug/gnumach_hardware.html">\
Hardware Compatibility Guide</a> to make life easy for all the prospective
Hurders out there. If you're new to the Hurd, you can find the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0111/msg00006.html">\
Hurd Orientation</a> at the beginning of each month on the Debian Hurd
mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>New Volunteer Position.</strong> Ben Collins put out the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0111/msg00050.html">\
request</a> on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/">debian-project</a>
mailing list for a volunteer to handle incoming donations. This
includes working with the Web team to keep the donations page updated,
placing donations and so forth.</p>

<p><strong>Keep in Touch...</strong> If you have any questions or
comments, suggestions or news tips, send them to <a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">\
dwn@debian.org</a>. For those of you who celebrate Thanksgiving, we hope
you have a wonderful holiday!</p>
