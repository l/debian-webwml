#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="2001-06-11" SUMMARY="master.debian.org down, bug #100 000 passed, newbie hints"

<p>
<b>master.debian.org was down several days this week</b>, with hard drive
problems. Master hosts the Debian bug tracking system, <tt>@debian.org</tt>
email addresses, mailing list archives, and other
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0106/msg00002.html">crucial
systems</a>, all of which were interrupted by the down-time. 

<p>While the Debian Project doesn't have all of its server eggs in 
one basket these days, a failure of master can still nearly paralyze 
the project. Even updates to the testing distribution halted since 
the BTS was not accessible. (And it disrupted preparations for DWN, 
making this issue late.) Most of master's drives turned out to be ok, 
and no data was lost from master. 

<p>A few messages to <tt>@debian.org</tt> addresses, including the BTS, 
did bounce, and anyone who submitted a bug this week only to get a 
bounce back is encouraged to resubmit it.

<p><b>One hundred thousand bugs</b> have passed through the Debian Bug
Tracking System now -- bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/100000">#100000</a>
was filed on June 7th, 2001. Unfortunately, few marked the occasion with
fanfare as planned since the BTS was down at the time.  Some
developers on IRC celebrated the bug with a special bot by Joey Hess.

<p>Of the 100,000 bugs, fewer than 19 thousand remain open - that's 
2 to 3 bugs per package, on average. The oldest open bug,
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/710">#710</a>, was filed 5 years ago, and the most
famous bug may be <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/6518">#6518</a>. 

<p>Debian's bug tracking system is more than a catalog of problems, 
it's a huge body of knowledge that's used for historical reference 
as well. Especially for things like the testing distribution, and so on. 

<p>We're proud of our BTS, nasty bugs and all, and it even plays an 
important role in our <a 
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Social Contract</a>. A big
thank you is surely deserved by both the developers who fixed those countless
thousands of bugs, and the users who took the time to make Debian better by
reporting them! If the number of bugs reported continues to be
approximately linear with time (as shown in this <a href="bts.png">graph</a>),
the already unwieldy bug numbers shouldn't get any bigger until early May,
2028.</p>

<p><b>MOSIX is in unstable.</b> <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0105/msg00069.html">MOSIX</a>
is a scalable, multi-platform, transparent load balancing tool.  Very
nice, and is now available as Debian packages.</p>

<p><b>Intent to Rewrite: pwgen.</b> Theodore Ts'o <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0105/msg02177.html">intends 
to rewrite pwgen</a>, a password generator, because of the license 
problems with it. This is a very welcome initiative, and multiple 
suggestions for improvements have already surfaced.</p>

<p><b>Experimental Python</b> packages have been <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-python-0105/msg00019.html">
released</a>, and Gregor Hoffleit has asked for help with auditing
the packages that depend on Python. 

<p><b>LinuxTag CD Preview available.</b>  The first <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0106/msg00024.html">preview of the CD</a>
for LinuxTag in Germany is <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0106/msg00021.html">ready</a>. It consists of potato boot-floppies 
and packages from woody and sid.  It seems to work, but is a preliminary 
version.</p>

<p><b>LinuxWorld Expo 2001/Tokyo.</b>  We got a report from Junichi
Uekawa about Debian's presence on LinuxWorld in Tokyo. Members of the
Debian Project were present and showing Debian on Macintosh Classic 
and PlayStation 2, among others.

<p><b>Freezing Woody.</b> Policy is <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0106/msg00003.html">
more or less frozen</a> and will only be updated if there are 
important bugfixes or changes, Julian Gilbey announced.  
Also, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0106/msg00001.html">
Anthony Towns posted an updated progress report</a> basically saying 
that we are not ready to freeze yet.</p>

<p><b>New kde.debian.net server</b> Ivan Moore <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0106/msg00000.html">
announced</a> that there would be a new site for Debian KDE packages
with a round of 2.1.x packages for Potato coming soon. 

<p><b>NewbieDoc News:</b> 

<p>The NewbieDoc folks sent us this update - thanks guys! 

<p>Jesse Goerz has been busy working on automating our build
process with custom dsssl stylesheets; Roman Lerallut and
Tom Huckstep have been working on automating our build process
with shell scripts.

<p>John Eisenstein has been reviewing every document that
comes out of the group, paying careful attention to the content
and structure of each sentence, and finding ways to deal with
an international spread.

<p>Newbie Tip: 
<br>Are you a writer? Learn DocBook so you can write ONCE -- and 
then render your work to PDF, to HTML, to PostScript, to plain text...
Just "apt-get install sgmltools-2" to get started, and learn about 
it at <a href="http://www.docbook.org">www.docbook.org</a>.
