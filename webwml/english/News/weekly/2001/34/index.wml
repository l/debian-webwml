<p><strong>Archive.debian.org is Back.</strong> The server that holds old
Debian releases, aliased to archive.debian.org, has been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-0111/msg00000.html">resurrected</a>
after it was offline for several months due to hardware problems The machine
now runs with a nice new 144 GB RAID and a new host, the Computer Science
Department at the <a href="http://www.cs.umn.edu/">University of
Minnesota</a>.  It is now administered by Scott Dier.  Sad news: One of the
new disks began to fail recently.</p>

<p><strong>Hurd H2 CD Images.</strong> The Hurd team informed us about new <a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/hurd/hurd-cd">Hurd CD Images</a>.  Snapshot
images are produced at a four to eight week intervals and the H2 images are
the tenth of the series.  The Hurd has grown from one CD image in August 2000
(A1) to four images in December 2001 (H2).  These images are a snapshots of a
developing os, so suitable precautions must be taken when making an
installation.  Just like other architectures, most important programs reside
on CD 1, while the other ones contain less important packages.</p>

<p><strong>On Fixing Security Critical Bugs.</strong> Javier
Fernández-Sanguino Peña made some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0112/msg00257.html">\
analysis</a> regarding vulnerabilities detected and posted to Bugtraq and
those sent as <a href="http://www.debian.org/security/">Debian Security
Announcements</a> (DSAs).  His analysis reveal that for the last year it has
taken Debian an average of 35 days to fix security-related vulnerabilites.
However, over 50% of the vulnerabilities where fixed in a 10-days time frame,
and over 15% of them where fixed the same day the advisory was released!</p>

<p><strong>More On Acronyms.</strong> We received some feedback about the item
covering acronyms in our last issue.  It was pointed out that several acronyms
are explained through using the <code>dict</code> program or one of it's
graphical frontends (like <code>kdict</code> or <code>wordinspect</code>).  In
case you haven't heard about dict yet, dict is the client that queries the
dictd server.  The DICT Development Group maintains several public servers
which can be accessed from any machine connected to the Internet.  Another
interesting resource is the <a
href="http://members.ams.chello.nl/j.vermeulen31/GPL_TLA_FAQ">List of
three-letter abbreviations</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Mailing Lists.</strong> The listmaster team <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0112/msg00004.html">created</a>
three new lists: <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-packages/">debian-qa-packages</a>,
which is used by the QA Team to handle bug reports against orphaned packages,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ssh/">debian-ssh</a>, which will be
used for Debian ssh packages maintenance and coordination and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-apache/">debian-apache</a>, which will be
used maintenance and coordination of packages for the Apache and related
packages.</p>

<p><strong>The Good, The Bad And The Ugly.</strong> Gergely Nagy posted a big
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg01346.html">rant</a>
about packaging software for Debian too quick and not paying enough attention
at packaging.  He is worried, because packages whose maintainer don't pay at
least a little attention to packaging, do not reflect the image he had about
Debian.  Face it, Debian is known for its quality.  This is something we can't
lose.</p>

#should this say it's something we *cant'* lose?
