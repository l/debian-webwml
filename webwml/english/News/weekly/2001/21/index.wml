<p><strong>Jigsaw Download.</strong> Richard Atterer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2001/debian-cd-200109/msg00000.html">\
announced</a>  the availability of Jigsaw Download 0.5.2
(or jigdo for short), a tool to help distribute large filesystem
images like CD ISOs or DVD UDF files. Jigdo consists of a program to
prepare the image file for download and a download tool to grab the
files. At this time the download tool has not been implemented. Jigdo
is a proposed replacement for the pseudo image kit. Richard is also
looking for help with Jigdo, so if anyone has some free time on
their hands this might be a fun project to sink your teeth into.</p>

<p><strong>Kerberos Integration Mailing List.</strong> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0109/msg00000.html">\
Sam Hartman</a> is setting up a mailing list for integrating Kerberos
support into Debian. Currently the list is not through Debian
servers, you can find the archives and signup for the list at <a
href="http://mailman.boxedpenguin.com/mailman/listinfo/debian-kerberos">\
http://mailman.boxedpenguin.com/mailman/listinfo/debian-kerberos</a>.

<p><strong>Adopt a Package!</strong> There are a lot of orphaned (102) and
up-for-adoption (35) packages out there. Some of the packages include kicq,
knews, mcvert (Mac to Unix file converter) and several others. This week's
list of packages is found <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0109/msg00003.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Translating Debian packages' descriptions.</strong> Michael Bramer
has posted a new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00297.html">proposal</a> to
support multilingual package descriptions.  In the meantime the <a
href="http://auric.debian.org/~grisu/ddtp/">Debian Description Translation
Server</a> has started sending out automatic notification mails whenever a new
translation has been entered or modified.  This caused some people feel
offended.  Adam Heath, as an example, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00309.html">wrote</a> about
this: "As an automated mail, to which I have not request, I consider this
spam."  It has not yet been decided how such translated descriptions should be
handled, so these mails are just notifications which will hit developers who
don't want to fiddle with it - and who may be confused by such mails.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Debian Archives.</strong> Many people discovered the need for
their own Debian archive in addition to the ones at ftp.debian.org as provided
by the project.  People who need updates to potato for corporate environments
or who are not yet registered Debian developers often create an archive of
their own.  Oohara Yuuma (&#22823;&#21407;&#38596;&#39340;) has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00629.html">announced</a> a
<a href="http://www.interq.or.jp/libra/oohara/apt-gettable/apt-gettable/">small
HOWTO</a> that describes the way how to upload custom Debian packages on a web
server so that they can be downloaded with apt-get by others.</p>

<p><strong>Switching to UTF-8.</strong> Radovan Garabik has written a <a
href="http://melkor.dnp.fmph.uniba.sk/~garabik/debian-utf8/HOWTO/">HOWTO</a>
that contains a step by step introduction to switching a Debian system to
use UTF-8 encoding.  Even though it is supposed to be well-documented how
to switch to UTF-8 encoding, there are many pitfalls and gotchas.  Often
one has to locate the relevant information somewhere on the net.  This
HOWTO intends to fill that gap.</p>

<p><strong>Debian mirrors on the 6Bone.</strong> Heikki Vatiainen has posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6-0108/msg00038.html">report</a> about
Debian on IPv6-enabled hosts.  Since there are two sites that are currently
working and others are (re)joining 6Bone in the future, the question is how to
add these hosts to the list of official Debian mirror servers.  APT is fully
IPv6 enabled and has been for a long time, so interested people can use these
servers without a hassle if DNS is set up properly.  There seem to have some
confusion whether to use AAAA or A6 records for IPv6 hosts.  Debian uses AAAA
and has added their IPv6-enabled hosts to the ipv6.debian.org domain.</p>

<p><strong>Bugs in standard packages.</strong> Martin Michlmayr has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00606.html">announced</a> the
availability of <a href="http://standard.debian.net/">standard.debian.net</a>.  It
displays all bugs in packages of priority `standard'.  "Standard" for the purpose of the
freeze also includes all packages included in tasks, that's roughly this <a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/~ajt/stddscs.txt">list</a>.  Since these are important
packages, NMUs should not be released.  Instead, patches or valuable comments should be
sent to the Bugtracking System.</p>

<p><strong>The Layne Incident</strong> The Debian-Security
list was plagued for quite a while with a rather unintelligent
individual who insisted on abusing the list with strings
of obscenities rather than unsubscribing himself. (How he
got subscribed in the first place is a matter of conjecture...) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2001/debian-security-200109/msg00072.html">
Wade Richards</a> seems to have hit upon an extremely elegant and
apparently effective solution to the problem. Since this sort of
thing happens every now and again, folks who spend a lot of time
on mailing lists may want to read Wade's solution.</p>

<p><strong>Pentium Optimized Debian.</strong> Risko Gergely wrote 
in and asked us to announce that an effort to recompile Debian Potato 
with Pentium optimization is underway and now apt-gettable. You can
find more info about these packages and apt lines at <a 
href="http://debian.fsn.hu/fsni586/debian/README.txt">
http://debian.fsn.hu/fsni586/debian/README.txt</a></p>

<p><strong>Importance of packages.</strong> Junichi Uekawa has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00550.html">announced</a> a <a
href="http://mikilab.doshisha.ac.jp/~dancer/analyse-sourcepackages">script</a> that will
calculate how many packages depend on a package.  It investigates both regular Depends as
well as Build-Depends.  The script has, however, issues with loops in the dependency tree,
it will report funky numbers of packages in such a case.</p>

<p><strong>Explicit Congestion Notification.</strong> After an update from a vanilla 2.2.x
kernel to a 2.4 some sites will effectively disappear from the internet.  <a
href="http://gtf.org/garzik/ecn/">Explicit Congestion Notification</a> (ECN) allows
routers to notify clients about network congestion, resulting in fewer dropped packets and
increased network performance.  Note that, on the Internet, there are many broken
firewalls which refuse connections from ECN-enabled machines, and it may be a while before
these firewalls are fixed. Until then, to access a site behind such a firewall (some of
which are <a href="http://urchin.earth.li/ecn/">major sites</a>) you will have to
disable this option.  A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00430.html">discussion</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00041.html">another</a> have been
started which targets to a smooth upgrade of a Debian system, when a new ECN-enabled 2.4.x
kernel is used.  The current problem with Debian provided kernel images seems that ECN is
enabled in the default 2.4.x kernel which is not disabled later
(<code>/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_ecn</code>).  </p>

<p><strong>Backup Package Maintenance.</strong> During the base freeze preparations in the
last few weeks, a problem Debian has always had became apparent again.  Since Debian is a
distributed, volunteer run project it is difficult to tell whether a maintainer is doing
Debian work at the moment or not.  In the freeze, it is often crucial to get a bug fixed
within a very short period of time.  If the maintainer doesn't respond to e-mail
immediately, you can either wait or make an NMU.  Martin Michlmayr has posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg00130.html">proposal</a> about a better
use of multiple maintainers by using a backup maintainer or two listed in the Uploaders
field.</p>

<p><strong>Adduser rewrite?</strong> Roland Bauerschmidt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0108/msg01999.html">released</a> his
plans of rewriting adduser from scratch in Python.  Adduser is in base and part
of the boot-floppies bootstrap process.  Rewriting it in Python would add
another set of dependencies which would bloat the base system even more.
Quoting Randolph Chung: "Creating more dependencies is a Bad Thing(tm)."</p>

<p><strong>Separate mailing list for users running testing?</strong> Discussions
on debian-user show that many people are already running testing/unstable and
have to ask back which distribution one is running who has experienced problems
with a certain part of the system.  The question <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0109/msg00006.html">came up</a>
whether <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing/">debian-testing</a>
is a place for users or developers to discuss issues. Dwarf <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0109/msg00008.html">clarified</a>
this: "This list was created for the testing group started during the release of
1.3. Most of the members at that time were Debian users, and not developers. The
whole point was to get users involved in testing.  Developers said they were
already testing on their own."</p>

<p><strong>New Packages.</strong> This a short list of a few of the
new and noteworthy packages for Debian this week. Note that this is
by no means an all-inclusive list or in any way a snub against any
packages not mentioned. Any maintainer who releases a package that
they'd like to call attention to should send us a note.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/berlin">\
     The Berlin Display Server</a> -- A windowing system not based on X 
     with some nifty features.
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/doc/docbook-book">\
     DocBook Book</a> -- The HTML version of the O'Reilly DocBook book.
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/teg">
     Teg</a> -- A turn-based strategy game. All work and no play... 
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/gqcam">\
     Gqcam</a> -- GTK Webcam control. 
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/gvidm">\
     gvidm</a> -- Gtk application to change video resolution in X. 
</ul>

<p><strong>Recent Security Advisories.</strong> There's only one
security advisory this week, in the telnet daemon in the 
netkit-telnet-ssl_0.16.3-1 package found in stable. Anyone using
this package will want to upgrade netkit-telnet-ssl. The original
advisory is <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/debian-security-announce-2001/msg00077.html">here</a>.
