# $Id$

<p><strong>Merry Christmas everybody.</strong> We hope that those of
you who are celebrating Christmas are enjoying some nice days.  Take a
rest from your regular life, think about the past year and think about
what you can do to improve Free Software and Debian in particular.
We're back being your servant, though only providing a small issue
this time.</p>

<p><strong>An Interactive Christmas Tree?</strong> Those of you who
are slightly bored by a regular Christmas tree may be interested in
this.  You may have read about it on other e-zines already, though.
At the Worcester Polytechnic Institute some students have crossed a
Christmas tree with a GNU/Linux box.  The result is <a
href="http://christmastree.wpi.edu/">christmastree.wpi.edu</a>, an
interactive christmas tree.</p>

<p><strong>Timeline for 2001.</strong> Even though this is not
directly related to Debian, it may be of interest for many of our
readers.  The team from Linux Weekly News (LWN) prepared an alpha
version of the <a
href="http://www.lwn.net/2001/features/Timeline/">2001 Linux
Timeline</a> which is the fourth in the series. Therein you'll find a
month-by-month recap of the major Linux and free software events from
this year.</p>

<p><strong>Localizing Debian.</strong> Michael Bramer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg01488.html">\
reported</a> about another attempt he made, to make public use of
translated packages descriptions, that he maintains.  He copied the
interface of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">\
packages.debian.org</a> to the <a
href="http://ddtp.debian.org/packages.debian.org/">DDTP server</a> in
order to provide a multilingual package search facility.  Currently
only German and Brazilian Portuguese are supported, but more languages
will follow as soon as more descriptions are translated to these
languages.  Michael would like the official packages.debian.org server
to support this.  Help is appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2r5 Ante Portas?</strong> Joey is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0112/msg00007.html">\
working</a> on a new revision of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 also known as
&ldquo;stable&rdquo;.  His plan is to get this revision out within the first
week of January 2002.  There are still some recompiles required,
though, in order to get new versions in the stable release synced with
all architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Losing Quality.</strong> Brian Wolfe posted a lengthy <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg01977.html">rant</a> about
Debian.  What he says is valid and describes a somewhat critical problem in
Debian.  While the number of packages and maintainer are increasing steadily
there are a lot of packages that weren't touched for a while, or whose
upstream has abandoned them apparently.  Old and buggy packages shed a bad
light on the Debian distribution.  Brian asks the Debian project to find a way
to warn the user if a package is abandoned upstream and that its bugs aren't
likely to get fixed if the maintainer is unwilling/able to fix it.</p>

<p><strong>Boot-Floppies 3.0.18 are Available.</strong> Adam Di Carlo <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0112/msg00015.html">\
reported</a> that new boot floppies were uploaded for five architectures and
ten languages through the language chooser, though not all languages are
available for all flavours.  It's been said that modconf lacks certain
translations, so help is appreciated.  If you have comments, suggestions, etc,
please send them to debian-boot@lists.debian.org.</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following new or
updated packages were added to the Debian archive during the last
seven days.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/galrey.html">galrey</a> 
    -- Command line image gallery generator. It also makes thumbnails.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/mayavi.html">mayavi</a> 
    -- A scientific data visualization system.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/openmcl.html">openmcl</a> 
    -- OpenMCL Common Lisp compiler.

    -- Small GTK-based login program.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/pencam.html">pencam</a> 
    -- Download images from STV0680B-001 chip based digital cameras.

    -- A minimal but configurable X11R6 window manager.

    -- Personal Information Manager for the console.
