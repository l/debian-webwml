<p><strong>Debian 2.2r4 Released!</strong> The 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2001/20011105">announcement</a> 
went out on Monday, Debian 2.2r4 is out. This release is part of the 
Potato series containing additional security fixes and bugfixes. If you're
running stable, you probably want to upgrade now. See the announcement
for more info.  Phil Hands <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0111/msg00023.html">created</a>
cd-images for this release already.</p>

<p><strong>Continuing The Freeze Process.</strong> Anthony Towns sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0111/msg00006.html">\
report</a> telling us that the project finally obtained the legal advice it
needed to go about putting crypto in main.  Since this was the last piece
which stalled the freeze process, there is progress now. This means that no
new packages will be added to base.  This especially requires
maintainers of base packages to avoid fiddling with their dependencies, or
compiling against new libraries.  Additionally, base packages should not be
bumping shlibs versions from this point, under any circumstances.</p>

<p><strong>Recognizing IRC Channels.</strong> RaphaÃ«l Hertzog proposed a
<a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2001/vote_0002">General
Resolution</a> targetting <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0111/msg00004.html">IRC as
a Debian communication channel</a> as a result of recent events on a famous
developer channel.  He proposes that all #debian-* channels be open to
anybody interested with the exception of #debian-private for which the same
policy applies as for the private mailing list.  However, Peter Makholm raised
the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0111/msg00007.html">question</a>
if Debian as an open project really can accept more closed forums?</p>

<p><strong>Serious Bug in gnome-pilot.</strong> There is a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00109.html">problem</a>
with the backup conduit in gnome-pilot 0.1.62 that can cause a crash requiring
a hard reset (and loss of all data) on at least some Palm devices.  The same
bug also renders all Palm device backups created by it completely
useless. These backups will, in all likelihood, crash the device if restored
to it.  The author recommends that everyone cease using 0.1.62 immediately.
New packages for 0.1.63 have been uploaded already.</p>

<p><strong>Default Mail Transport Agent (MTA).</strong> Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00101.html">investigated</a>
the current situation with dependencies to MTAs now that Exim is the default
MTA on a freshly installed Debian system.  This revealed several different
dependencies instead of just <code>exim | mail-transport-agent</code>, which
are parsed by our package tools as "use exim as preference over other packages
that provide mail-transport-agent, however they are fine as well".</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade for two Important Machines.</strong> Adam Heath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00042.html">announced</a> a
maintenance hour for the machines master and murphy, which perform important functions for
the project.  Brainfood has replaced 64MB of RAM with 512MB on our poor list
server, which helps a lot for this loaded machine.  The other machine was
taken back to its co-location.  Thanks <a href="http://www.brainfood.com/">\
Brainfood</a>, this is really appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>Policy Proposal for javadoc.</strong> Guillaume Rousse has
a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0111/msg00012.html">\
proposal</a> for the placement of javadoc-generated documentation under
<code>/usr/share/apidoc</code>. This might be of interest to any Java
developers out there.</p>

<p><strong>Misuse of Debconf Notes.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg02204.html">feels</a> that
both of the recently added pcmcia-cs debconf notes (about 2.4 kernels and
network up ordering) are a misuse of the note datatype, which, as he states in
the debconf tutorial, is for "something important, that the user really should
see." Joey's main concern is that debconf notes are being vastly overused,
and that this will probably result in a Debian installation which is so
cluttered with low-value notes that the important stuff is easily missed.</p>

<p><strong>ReiserFS On SRM-Alpha Drives.</strong> James Freels converted all
of his Ext2 filesystems to ReiserFS filesystems on his Alpha machine.  He has
written <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-0110/msg00099.html">\
notes</a> to himself on how to setup the boot process for a Debian/Alpha
computer using the SRM console.  Some of it may also be helpful for other
architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Debian And /usr Mounted read-only.</strong> Anthony Towns recently
posted a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00212.html">report</a> about a Debian system which has
<code>/usr</code> mounted read-only.  During package installation it will be
remounted read-write, which <code>apt</code> is configured to do.  However,
there is still a problem with used files that were replaced during
installation.  In such a case the filesystem can't be umounted again.  Anthony
attached two scripts which ought to take care of this.</p>

<p><strong>Bug-Squashing Party #6.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0111/msg00000.html">\
announced</a> that the sixth Debian Bug-Squashing Party for woody will take
place on the second weekend of November: Friday 9th to Sunday 11th.  The goal
is to fix release-critical bugs, especially those filed against base and
standard/task packages.  As usual, the party will by co-ordinated in the
\#debian-bugs IRC channel on the OpenProjects Network (IRC server
irc.debian.org).</p>

<p><strong>New and Updated Packages.</strong>
