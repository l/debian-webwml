<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Nominations for Debian Project Leader elections began with Ben
Collins</b> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0101/msg00003.html">
nominating himself</a>. Wichert Akkerman has indicated he will not seek a
third term, so Ben is running unopposed for now. The nomination period should
end around February 3rd, then candidates will have three weeks for campaigning
and elections should begin on approximately February 24th.
</p>

<b>It's a hard time to be a commercial Debian derivative.</b> Corel is 
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/01/23/1844204">
selling of their linux division</a>, and Stormix has apparently 
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=01/01/27/1451236&amp;mode=nocomment">
filed for bankruptcy</a> and <a href="http://advogato.org/person/neuro/">shut
down</a> the popular <tt>ftp.ca.debian.org</tt> server due to bandwidth
costs. We wish everyone at Storm the best of luck, and hope they
manage to weather this problem. Meanwhile, Progeny seems to be doing well:
their <a href="http://www.progeny.com/news/beta2release.html">latest beta</a>
was just released, and they're 
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/debianplanet/article.php?sid=120">raffling
off</a> a spiffy crusoe laptop at Linuxworld and donating the proceeds to
Debian.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new version of Debian policy is out.</b> As always, the changes
developers need to keep track of are summarized in the
<a href="http://kitenet.net/doc/debian-policy/upgrading-checklist.txt.gz">
upgrade checklist</a>. Debconf is now blessed by policy, although its use
is not required. Also, init scripts should begin to break out configuration
information to files in the <tt>/etc/default/</tt> directory for easy
editing.
</p>

<p>
<b>Translating Debian</b> is a massive effort, and now there's a 
<a href="../../../../intl/l10n/">website</a> to help translators keep
track of what has been done. There are some interesting
<a href="../../../../intl/l10n/l10n-rank">overall stats</a> there. 54 
languages are supported by Debian, to one degree or another (85 thousand
messages have been translated to German, but only 3 are translated into
Arabic). You can <a href="../../../../intl/l10n/l10n-lang">drill down</a>
to detailed information about the translation status of your favorite
language or package, and find something to work on -- and many people
already have. There has recently been a marked increase in the number of
translations, especially
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0101/msg02410.html">translations
of debconf templates</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>A torrent of security fixes</b> have been released in the past two weeks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>remotely exploitable buffer overflows in 
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00019.html">
    bind</a> (a new upstream version was put in stable, which has caused some
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0101/msg05121.html">problems</a>)
<li>more remotely exploitable buffer overflows in
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-012">micq</a>,
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-013">mysql</a>, and 
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-018">tinyproxy</a>
<li>a remotely exploitable format string hole in 
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-016">wu-ftpd</a>
<li>locally exploitable buffer overflows in 
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-014">splitvt</a> and
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-017">jazip</a>
<li>a bug in the <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-015">sash package</a>
    that made /etc/shadow world-readable
<li>symlink attacks against
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-019">squid</a>, 
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00014.html">
    exmh</a>, and
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00015.html">
    inn2</a>
<li>a "<i>remote DOS and remote information leak</i>" in 
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-020">php4</a>
<li>a symlink attack and information leak in 
    <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-021">apache</a>
<li>a hole in 
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00016.html">
    cron</a> that allowed an attacker to read other people's crontab files
</ul>

<p>
<b>Putting all of Debian under central CVS revision control</b> is the
topic of <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0101/msg02996.html">
this thread</a>. Many people seem to have misunderstood the original
post, which does <em>not</em> propose that all Debian developers be required
to start committing changes to cvs rather than uploading packages. Instead,
it just proposes that a cvs repository be set up to automatically track new
versions of packages as they enter Debian in the traditional way (although
much Debian development already takes place in scattered cvs repositories).
There has also been concern about the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0101/msg03081.html">disk
space</a> such a cvs repository would require. But if hardware can be found
and someone takes the time to set it up, this could be a valuable resource
for Debian.
