<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
For years we've known that Debian's means of getting packages and releases
out to users is lacking from a security standpoint. There has been no way
to know that the package you just downloaded was really made by a Debian
developer and is really a part of a current Debian release. This is rapidly
changing, and <b>soon users will have two complementary ways to verify that
they are installing legitimate packages</b>. This week a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0103/msg00024.html">patch was
posted</a> to the debian-dpkg list that adds support to dpkg for checking
signatures of Debian packages. The signatures are held in a new section of
the package itself, and tools are entering Debian now to add and check
such signatures. This type of package signing parallels similar techniques
that have been present in the rpm world for a long time, and they are a
welcome addition to dpkg, but their usefulness should not be
over-emphasized.
</p>

<p>
<b>Signed packages alone still leave open several avenues of attack.</b>
Various evil things can be done to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0103/msg00046.html">Packages
file</a>, or by tricking apt into downloading an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0103/msg00035.html">old and
insecure package</a>. Closing off these attacks requires another layer of
security -- signed releases. Already Release.gpg files are appearing on the
archive, and apt will soon be able to verify these signatures when it
upgrades a Debian system. In the final analysis, neither of these schemes
guarantees absolute security, but they will make attacks much harder for
the black hats, and perhaps by the time woody is released, both types of 
signatures will be widely available.
</p>

<p>
<b>Preparations are underway for an update to stable, Debian version
2.2r3.</b> As in most minor revisions, packages with security problems,
copyright issues, or very bad bugs are candidates to be updated in this
release. It may also include updates to make it compatible with the 2.4
kernel, since all the necessary packages are 
<a href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/kernel-24.html">already backported</a>.
Martin Schulze is
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0103/msg00008.html">
coordinating the new release</a>, and his list of packages that will get in
is available <a href="http://master.debian.org/~joey/2.2r3/">on the web</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>DPL elections are under way, after a few false starts.</b> Developers can
pick up a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0103/msg00005.html">
ballot</a> and mail it in, gpg-signed. Voting ends on the 28th.
</p>

<p>
<b>Another bug squashing party</b> is planned for 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0103/msg00009.html">
this weekend</a>. Nearly 350 release critical bugs remain after the last
party, and they all need to be fixed before woody is released, so anyone
with spare time this weekend is encouraged to lend a hand and fix a bug or
two.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some weeks, unending security fixes pour into Debian.
This was such a week.</b> Some of these announcements are
for problems that were actually fixed earlier but not 
announced, but many are brand-new security fixes.
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-032">Several minor
bugs</a> in stable's proftpd package could lead to minor security problems.
<li>A remotely exploitable 
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-033">buffer overflow</a>
in analog could be exploited via the CGI interface.
<li>Several <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-034">buffer
overflows</a> in ePerl were discovered that could lead to a remote root
exploit in some setups.
<li>A <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-035">remote denial of service
attack</a> was found in man2html -- it could be forced to consume all memory.
<li>A <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-036">local exploit in midnight
commander</a>.
<li>All of the xaw replacement libraries (nextaw, xaw3d, and xaw95) were
updated to fix some 
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-037">
security holes</a> that were earlier found and fixed in xaw itself.
<li>A <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-038">temp
file</a> security hole was fixed in sgml-tools.
<li><a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-039">
Two security holes</a> in stable's glibc, both root exploits, were fixed.
(Note that the fix broke ldd on suid binaries, so an update will probably be
released eventually to fix that.)
<li>A <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-040">
remotely exploitable buffer overflow</a> in stable's slrn.
<li>Joe <a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-041">
unsafely read</a> <tt>.joerc</tt> from the current directory, this was
locally exploitable joe was ran in directories such as <tt>/tmp/</tt>.
<li>A
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-042">
remotely exploitable buffer overflow</a> in gnuserv and xemacs.
<li>Several 
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-043">remote
exploits</a> in Zope.
<li>A 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00042.html">buffer overflow in mailx</a>
that could locally yield access to the mail group.
</ul>
<p>
The security team deserves many thanks for all their hard work this week.
