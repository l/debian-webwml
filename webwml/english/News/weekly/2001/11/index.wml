<p><b>You like us, you really like us!</b> We got a slew of letters
(well, emails...) saying that it was good to see DWN back. Thanks
for the show of support, we'll do our best to keep you informed! A
big Kudos to Joey Hess for providing helpful guidance.

<p><b>Boot floppy success.</b> Santiago Garcia Mantinan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00071.html">reports</a>
that he has had success with a complete install of Woody using the
new boot floppies, and a few modifications of his own. And there was
much rejoicing...  A little later, an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0105/msg00003.html">updated
progress report</a>, was posted.  According to this, the freeze will
start in June.

<p><b>Why care about boot floppies?</b> A few inquisitive minds
wanted to know what all the fuss about boot floppies was, when they
just wanted to install from CD-ROM. The software used for
installation are all designed to fit on floppy disks, though they
may actually reside on CD-ROM, hard disk or on a
network. For instance, you can download a bootable image sized for
1.2MB, 1.44MB or 2.88MB floppies - but that image can actually
reside on just about any bootable media that your system can
handle. Floppy disks were a much more common install method several
years ago, though many folks install from CD-ROM or do a network
install rather than fussing with floppies.

<p><b>Tasks policy proposal.</b> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00075.html">raised
the topic</a> of creating a proper tasks policy for Woody. Anthony
proposes a set of guidelines for task-* packages that would make a
task-* package more flexible, and allow for selection of packages
rather than all packages mentioned in the task header.

<p><b>Separate phases.</b> Glenn McGrath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0105/msg00110.html">proposed
separating</a> the preparation and installation phases of the Debian
installer to make the installer more versatile. Debian-installer is
the installer project for the version of Debian after woody.  It has a
whole new design, while boot-floppies are going to be used for the
last time for woody.

<p><b>Security notices.</b> Several packages have been the subject
of Debian Security Alerts this week. If you're using Zope, mandb,
gftp or Samba, be sure to visit the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/security/">Debian Security Page</a> for
information on upgrading to newer versions.

<p><b>JBuilder4 on Debian/PPC.</b> In case you want to run JBuilder4
on PPC, Franck Routier was kind enough to contribute his success
story and <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0105/msg00004.html">instructions</a> 
on getting it running. Thanks for the report, Franck! 

<p><b>Package list for 2.2r4.</b> A list of proposed updated packages
for 2.2r4 was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0105/msg00005.html">announced</a> by 
Martin Schulze.

<p><b>New packages this week.</b> New to Debian this week are the
IDS filesystem checker <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/fcheck.html">fcheck</a>,
the Java VM 
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/japhar.html">japhar</a>,
XFS filesystem support <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/kernel-patch-xfs.html">
kernel-patch-xfs</a>, the <a 
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/serpento.html">serpento</a>
dict server and <a
