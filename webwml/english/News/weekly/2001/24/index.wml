<p><strong>Debian international.</strong> We noticed that another language 
has been added to the list of <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/website/translation_coordinators">supported
languages</a> of <a href="$(HOME)/">www.debian.org</a>.  
Catalan was added a while ago, and now Indonesian has been added as well.
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/stats/">Translation
statistics</a> show we have about one thousand Web pages and no more than 100
per language are outdated.  Our translators seem to do a really good job.
Including Indonesian and Catalan, the main page on our web server is available
in 25 languages.</p>

<p><strong>Stripping down busybox.</strong> Busybox is the tool which is used
on embedded systems and the Debian boot-floppies.  On our boot-floppies it
provides most of the programs (like ls, mount, umount etc.).  Busybox,
however, has grown from Potato to Woody and has become <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0109/msg00408.html">too large</a> on
SPARC and PowerPC.  Erik Andersen, its author, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0109/msg00424.html">explains</a>
more ways to save space on our boot-floppies.</p>

<p><strong>Boot-floppies 3.0.14 released.</strong> Adam Di Carlo has had a
hectic week, but managed to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0109/msg00365.html">release</a> a
new version of boot floppies.  This version contains all required fixes for
S/390, MIPS, MIPSel, ARM, M68k, HPPA and IA64 as well as patches required to
get add support for ReiserFS and ext3 on IA32.  Packages for several
architectures (hppa, ia64, i386, m68k, mipsel, powerpc and s390) have already 
been uploaded, others are scheduled for building.  In the meantime Anthony Towns has
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0110/msg00000.html">decided</a>
that mips, mipsel and s390 will be part of the woody release.</p>

<p><strong>LaTeX too old?</strong> A couple of users stomped over this problem
in the past.  After installation it simply wasn't possible to compile a LaTeX
file, since there was no <code>latex.fmt</code> file.  This file normally gets
created during installation, which will fail if LaTeX is too old.  An internal
check prohibits its compilation if the originating file is older than one year 
and some months.  There were some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint-0109/msg00043.html">\
concerns</a> about this which <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-tetex-maint-0109/msg00045.html">revealed</a>
that the time span was increased to 30 months, however, this could still cause
problems once woody is released.  Therefore the default LaTeX build on Debian
will ignore this test.</p>

<p><strong>Securing Debian HOWTO needs help!</strong> Javier
Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0109/msg00285.html">asked</a>
for help with this document.  He is currently suffering from an overload of
information to be added to the <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/">Securing
Debian HOWTO</a> which was formerly edited by Alexander Reelsen.  If you can
afford some spare time dedicated to this task, please help Javi by providing
patches to the current CVS version of the document, see <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/user-manuals#securing">here</a> for details.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Mirror Infrastructure.</strong> There have been intermittent
problems with the mirror infrastructure over the last year or so, but we
haven't kept <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/">debian-mirrors</a> up to date
with that, thinking nobody would mind a few glitches.  This may change in the
future, Josip Rodin, active member of mirrors@debian.org, predicts in an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-0109/msg00000.html">announcement</a>
of hardware changes on our ftp-master system.</p>

<p><strong>dput gone?</strong> People were <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01554.html">missing</a>
this package.  Due to a newly added dependency to GnuPG, which is only
available in non-US, the dput utility had to be removed from the main archive
and re-uploaded to the non-US archive as new package.  It has been installed
into the archive now, but was unavailable for a couple of days before.  Even
though checking of signatures could be made optional, more crypto support is
to be added, so it has to stay in non-US until we are allowed to add crypto
software to the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>Checking a Debian mirror.</strong> Grahame Bowland has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01915.html">announced</a>
that he wrote a tool called <a
href="http://projects.azale.net/deblint/">deblint</a> which tests the
integrity of a Debian mirror.  He was inspired to write this tool by the frustration
caused by missing files on some mirrors.  The name will change though, because
there was a <code>deblint</code> once before.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging NSA Security Enhanced Linux.</strong> Russell Coker sent
an <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01408.html">ITP</a>
for packaging a kernel patch for NSA Security Enhanced Linux.  However, when
downloading the source files you're forced to agree to the NSA's <a
href="http://www.nsa.gov/selinux/src-disclaim.html">disclaimer</a>.  It was
unclear whether Debian may distribute the software without that disclaimer,
though the software has been released using the GPL.  This problem was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01828.html">clarified</a>
later, so the only thing that holds an upload into the archive is the quality
of the packages, the maintainer told us.  Preliminary packages are <a
href="http://www.coker.com.au/lsm/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bad package descriptions.</strong> Daniel Burrows has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01962.html">examined</a>
descriptions of our packages.  His results are distressing.  A statistically
significant number of them weren't even properly formatted according to our
own definitions, and many were grammatically incorrect, stylistically awkward,
or just <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0109/msg01970.html">plain
unhelpful</a>.  In general, the guidelines of good (technical) writing should
apply.  Be clear, be concise, be unambiguous, be informative, and be correct.
The mailing list <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-english/">debian-l10n-english</a>
could be used for discussing detailed problems with the English language.</p>

<p><strong>Now for something completely different...</strong> While not
specifically Debian-related, we thought it might be of interest to our
readers that the W3C has <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/10/patent-response">\
extended</a> the public comment period for their Patent Policy Framework.
Essentially, there's a proposal afoot to adopt a second licensing mode for
W3C Recommendations, "Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (RAND) Licensing."
Any licensing fee, however, is bound to be unreasonable for Free Software
developers and will have the effect of locking out Free and Open Source
developers from implementing Standards and Recommendations under this
licensing policy and/or marginalizing the W3C role as a standards body.
You can also read Alan Cox's <a 
href="http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-09-30-010-20-OP-CY">\
take</a> on the Patent Policy. If you make any comments, be sure to 
address specific objections to the Policy, don't just say "I don't like
it."</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Ben Collins.</strong> Debian Planet has an
<a href=../../oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.org/debianplanet/article.php?sid=413">\
interview</a> with the Debian Project Leader, Ben Collins.  He admits
that he was a regular user for three months before becoming a
developer.  "It's kind of hard to use Debian without becoming active
in it's development", he says.</p>

<p><strong>LSB Application Battery.</strong> George Kraft <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/lsb-spec/2001/lsb-spec-200109/msg00050.html">\
announced</a> on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/lsb-spec/">lsb-spec</a>
list that there's a need for someone to create a list of Linux
Standards Base compliant applications to run on compliant LSB
systems. If you're interested in helping out, take a look at this
discussion and jump aboard.</p>
