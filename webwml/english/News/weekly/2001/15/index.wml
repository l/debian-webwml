<p><b>MOSIX Correction:</b> 
Last week we mentioned the <a href="http://www.mosix.org/">MOSIX</a> 
tool, and there may have been some confusion when we described it 
as a "multi-platform" tool. MOSIX works on several OSes, but only 
on the x86 architechture. However, ports for SPARC and Alpha are 
under way as well.</p>

<p><b>KDE 2.2 Alpha Packages:</b> 
If you want to live on the bleeding edge, Ivan E. Moore II, the Debian 
KDE maintainer has made preliminary <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0106/msg00042.html">KDE 2.2 
packages</a> available on people.debian.org. Thanks, Ivan!</p>

<p><b>Inexpensive Linux Laptops:</b> 
Chris Ivanovich is looking for an inexpensive laptop that is 
Linux-friendly. He's gotten quite a few suggestions on the 
debian-laptop list. If you have any suggestions, or are looking 
for one yourself, check out <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0106/msg00147.html">the 
discussion</a>.</p>

<p><b>When it rains...:</b> 
Auric, Debian's FTP master server, <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00760.html">crashed</a> 
during last Thursday's 'dinstall' run, which corrupted the database. 
Consequently, testing disappeared for a day, but returned on Friday.</p>

<p><b>Watch where you put that...:</b> 
On debian-devel, the location of the traceroute program is the subject
of (another) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00790.html">heated
discussion</a>. Should it go into /usr/sbin or /usr/bin?  Currently,
it makes its home in /usr/sbin -- where the package maintainer
believes it should be. As always, there are some strong opinions and
interesting points made, as well as a few silly ones -- almost as much
fun as watching two geeks argue over the relative merits of Emacs and
vi.</p>

<p><b>Improving Qmail Performance:</b> 
It's always good to get advice on how to improve system performance. 
Jason Lim <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0106/msg00221.html">
has a recommendation</a> on the debian-isp list that might be of 
interest to Qmail users.</p>

<p><b>Exim and outgoing SMTP AUTH:</b> 
Andrew J. Perrin is a Telocity user who is <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0106/msg02983.html">looking 
for help</a> to make Exim work with his ISP's mail servers, which now 
use SMTP AUTH. SMTP is the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, which 
is used to transmit mail from one mail server to another. It typically 
does not require a username/password pair to transmit mail, but to prevent 
spammers abusing their mail servers to relay mail across the Internet, 
ISPs usually use the IP address of the sender and the destination of 
the mail to decide if they will accept it. Some ISPs are supplementing 
this with the SMTP AUTH system, where in order to relay mail to another 
machine, senders must provide a username and password. Unfortunately, 
Telocity's idea of how this works doesn't quite match Exim's... If you 
have any ideas, join in the thread on the debian-user mailing list.</p>

<p><b>NewbieDoc News:</b> 
We need more proto-newbies! If you've got a hurdle that you figured 
out how to overcome -- maybe a configuration setting for Exim, or a 
trick with Apache, or a command in vim -- we'd love to hear about it. 
You'll be able to help someone tomorrow by documenting what you learned 
today. Please help out -- see the <a 
href="http://newbiedoc.sourceforge.net/">web site</a> or <a 
href="mailto:newbiedoc-discuss@lists.sourceforge.net">mailing list</a> for more 
details!</p>

<p>School finals have just about drained our talent pool dry recently, 
so the NewbieDoc effort has been a bit quiet lately. Even so, Will 
Trillich has been applying some PHP tricks to automate the NewbieDoc 
listings, so our document listings are now generated on-the-fly, and 
Romain Lerallut has re-wrapped the whole NewbieDoc set in tarball 
form, and it's available for download now.</p>

<p><b>Newbie Tip:</b> 
If you haven't tried using Mutt to read your mail, you should give 
it a whirl. First, "apt-get install mutt" and then run "mutt" to read 
your messages. To see how powerful the customization features are, you 
can visit a web site and <a href="http://linuxbrit.co.uk/mutt/" 
>download some example configurations</a> there.</p>

<p><b>Security Advisories:</b> 
Several have been issued this week for various Debian packages. 
Take a look and see if you need to update your system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-060">fetchmail</a> -- buffer overflow</li>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-061">gnupg</a> -- printf format attack</li>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-062">rxvt</a> -- buffer overflow</li>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-063">xinetd</a> -- change default umask</li>
</ul>
<p>As always, many thanks to the security team for their hard work.</p>

<p><b>New packages this week:</b></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/3dwm-geoclient.html">3dwm</a> -- a 3D user environment</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/kino.html">kino</a> -- a non-linear video editing tool</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/jfs.html">jfs</a> -- tools for managing (IBM's) JFS filesystem</li>

<p>Also of special note, after a <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg00245.html">heated thread</a> on debian-devel, 
last week Mozilla 0.9.1, the first new version since November 2000, was installed to non-US/main.</p>
