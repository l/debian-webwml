<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>And the winner is ... Ben Collins.</b> Congratulations to our new Debian
Project Leader, and thanks to all the candidates for volunteering. Here is
Ben's <a href="mail#mail1">acceptance message</a>. Details about the result of the
vote are <a href="../../../../News/2001/20010329">here</a>. Note that
elsewhere, full details of who voted for what were accidentally posted; DPL
votes are not supposed to be made public, but it was an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0103/msg00163.html">honest
mistake</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>This is the last edition of Debian Weekly News for a while.</b> There are
several reasons to stop publication:
</p>
<ul>
<li>DWN's editor is preparing for a cross-country move, and won't have time
for the next month to prepare the newsletter.
<li>After two years of weekly publication, it's becoming quite a strain
to maintain a consistent level of quality in the newsletter. Posting
intervals have already become somewhat sporadic, and content of late has
been thin. This is not due to any lack of activity in Debian to report on,
but rather due to one person becoming a bit jaded with reporting on the
project.
</ul>
<p>
Publication may restart in May, or this may be the last edition of DWN.
Whatever happens, Debian news continues to be available from other sources:
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/debian/latest.html">Kernel Cousin Debian</a>,
<a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Debian Planet</a>, and even
<a href="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a>. Rather than reopen, it
may make better sense for Debian Weekly News to merge with one of the above
news sources. Your comments and suggestions are 
<a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">welcome</a>, and thank you for reading
Debian Weekly News!
