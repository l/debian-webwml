<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.

<p>
<b>Last weekend's bug squashing party was another success</b>, with 120
release critical bugs fixed. 300 RC bugs remain. And
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/90000">bug #90000</a> was filed, so the
prospect of 6-figure bug report numbers is not far off.
