Subject: Thanks to everyone...

...that voted for me (I know who you are ;). It shows me that a lot of
you have faith in my ability to be the DPL, and I plan to live up to
that trust. Thanks also to every else that voted. At first I was
disappointed by only 311 total votes cast, but thinking back at past
elections, it seems that this has been a good turn out in comparison.
My thanks as well to the other candidates. All together this was probably
the best ballot we've had. The other candidates definitely had their strong
points, some well above my own. This makes the victory even more
humbling.

For the next two weeks I am going to sit back and absorb some of the
information that is coming in, and also get used to the idea of being
the DPL (the swelling of my head may take some time to go down :). Plus,
I am moving to a new house next weekend, so this probably isn't the best
time for me to jump into any lengthy proposals, or discussiong.

Thanks to everyone again.

Ben Collins
