<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>DPL election update:</b> One more platform was posted, by 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0102/msg00066.html">Bdale
Garbee</a>, who has quite a long history in Debian. Anand Kumria has not
posted a platform. There has been a low level of discussion on debian-vote
about the elections, but it's been healthily non-political and quite
restrained. The campaigning period is winding down now, and elections begin
on the 7th.
</p>

<p>
<b>It's another rough week for unstable trackers.</b> 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0103/msg00636.html">Pam was
broken</a>, breaking any services that use <tt>pam_limits.so</tt>, including
ssh and cron (this is now fixed). More apt changes are afoot, and a major
change to debconf just went into unstable, adding a real back-end database 
to that program at last.
</p>

<p>
<b>The recent bug squashing party was a great success</b>; over the two day
period, some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0102/msg01810.html">
130 release critical bugs</a> were dealt with. Of course there are 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">many more</a> release
critical bugs to fix before release. More bug squashing parties are planned..
</p>

<p>
<b>The dates for the Debian Conference</b> have
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00021.html">
changed</a> to prevent conflicts with other European events such as LinuxTag. 
The conference will be held "<i>From Monday July the 2nd to Thursday July
the 5th, in Bordeaux (France)</i>".
