<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
There will be a DPL campaign after all -- Anand Kumria, Bdale Garbee 
(20010202020152.A743435EA6@rover.gag.com), and Branden Robinson
(20010205004204.B23723@deadbeast.net) have joined Ben Collins in announcing
they will run for DPL. The timeline for the elections has been pushed back
(20010205175639.C7865@cistron.nl) since things got off to a late start.

<b>A major change has been made to the new maintainer process.</b>
Prospective developers must now get a reccommendation from a current Debian
developer before they can go through the new maintainer process. It is
hoped that this will cut down on the number of applicants who are not
serious about becoming developers, and speed up the process for everyone
else. In his mail explaining the new requirement
(20010205233103.A5210@sumpf.cyrius.com) Martin Michlmayr notes:
"<i>For anyone seriously interested in
Debian, getting recommended won't be a problem at all -- if he has
a package in Debian already, his sponsor can recommend him; if he
has done work on a Debian port, the web pages or boot-floppies then
he will know Debian developers to recommend him.</i>" For this to work
though, existing developers will need to recommend applicants who they have
worked with. Martin recommends: "<i>Just ask yourself if you
want to see him in Debian -- if you think he should be a Debian
developer then go ahead and recommend him.</i>"
</p>

<p>
Experimental and proposed-updates, long two warts on the side of the Debian
archive, have moved into the package pool. The new setup should be much
cleaner. James Troup explains the details.

Two security updates have came out recently. 
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-027">openssh</a> has a remote buffer
overflow bug which can lead to remote root access, and
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-028">man-db</a> has a format string
bug that allows local attackers to run code as user 'man'. The non-free ssh
is also vulnerable to the ssh holes, and as a fixed package is not available,
upgrading to openssh is reccommended.

(** collect testing problems (like lilo getting in, console-tools breaking
because of dep on newer debhelper, and security issue), and do a little
segment on those ***)
