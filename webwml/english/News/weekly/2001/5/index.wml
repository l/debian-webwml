candidates; new maintainer changes; testing troubles"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The DPL campaign is heating up.</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00000.html">Anand
Kumria</a>, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00001.html">
Bdale Garbee</a>, and 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00002.html">Branden
Robinson</a> have joined Ben Collins in announcing that they will run for DPL.
The timeline for the elections was 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00004.html">pushed
back</a> since things got off to a late start. The nomination period ends
today, and then campaigning will begin in earnest.
</p>

<p>
<b>A major change has been made to the new maintainer process.</b>
Prospective developers must now get a reccommendation from a current Debian
developer before they can go through the new maintainer process. It is
hoped that this will cut down on the number of applicants who are not
serious about becoming developers, and speed up the process for everyone
else. In his 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00004.html">mail
explaining the new requirement</a>, Martin Michlmayr notes:
"<i>For anyone seriously interested in
Debian, getting recommended won't be a problem at all -- if he has
a package in Debian already, his sponsor can recommend him; if he
has done work on a Debian port, the web pages or boot-floppies then
he will know Debian developers to recommend him.</i>" For this to work
though, existing developers will need to recommend applicants they have
worked with. Martin recommends: "<i>Just ask yourself if you
want to see him in Debian -- if you think he should be a Debian
developer then go ahead and recommend him.</i>"
</p>


<p>
<b>Some problems with testing have come to light</b> over the past couple of
weeks. A broken version of lilo somehow slipped into testing (by accident),
and we had another round of the same lilo problems unstable users have
endured. Then a new version of console-tools entered testing but it turned
out it had an <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/84741">undeclared dependancy</a>
on unstable's version of debconf, which is not available in testing. Many
other packages that are broken for one reason or another have
been <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0102/msg00530.html">removed
from testing</a> until they get fixed. These problems just show that
maintainance of testing cannot be entirely automated; it needs some manual 
attention just like other branches of Debian. Testing is meant to be somewhere
in between stable and unstable in up-to-dateness and usability, and it is
meeting that goal, though it has required a bit more maintenance effort than
we might have expected. But a more worrying problem with testing has also
emerged.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0102/msg00629.html">trickle
into testing</a></b> just as slowly as do any other updated packages
from unstable. While stable has <tt>security.debian.org</tt> to provide 
timely security fixes, and unstable gets most fixes immediatly, security 
fixes will not enter testing until they have been built on all architectures,
and until all their dependancies have also entered testing. Unrelated release
critical bugs can keep security fixes out of testing too. So while testing is
reasonably current, and not too prone to breakage, security fixes can be
delayed for an uncomfortably long time. One fix for this problem would be to
add a testing section to <tt>security.debian.org</tt>, but there has not been
any enthusiasm voiced in the thread so far about this option, probably because
it would be a lot more work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Four security updates have came out recently.</b>
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-027">openssh</a> has a remote buffer
overflow bug which can lead to remote root access. The non-free ssh
is also vulnerable to the ssh holes, and as a fixed package is not available,
upgrading to openssh is reccommended. An omnibus security update for the
version of xfree86 in stable was released
(200102121712.f1CHCSp14903@fog.mors.wiggy.net). It corrects denial of service
attacks, numerous buffer overflows, and numerous temporary files problems.
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-028">man-db</a> has a format string
bug that allows local attackers to run code as user 'man'. Several denial
of service attacks were fixed in proftpd (jeQtTD.A.LyD.O51h6@murphy). 
</p>

<p>
<b>Experimental and proposed-updates</b>, long two warts on the side of the
Debian archive, have moved into the package pool. The new setup should be
much cleaner. James Troup explained 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00009.html/">
the details</a>.
