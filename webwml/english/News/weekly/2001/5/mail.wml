Subject: New Perl Packages Released

After quite a lengthy gestation period, the new perl packages have been
uploaded to auric.

There have been quite a few changes, so a dist-upgrade will be required 
to install these.

Perl module packagers should note that the procedure for building
packages has changed.  Please refer to:

    <a href="https://people.debian.org/~bod/perl-policy/ch-module_packages.html">https://people.debian.org/~bod/perl-policy/ch-module_packages.html</a>

for details.
