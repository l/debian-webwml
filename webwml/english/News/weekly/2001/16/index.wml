<p><b>Debian BSD?</b> The Debian-BSD list has picked up a little
steam lately. The Debian-BSD list has been alive since May of 
1999, but "never gets far past the chat stage," to quote
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0106/msg00013.html">
Gary Kline</a>. <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0106/threads.html">
Andreas Krennmair</a> posted a list of necessary packages, and
there seems to be some intense interest from several people.</p>

<p><b>GCC 3.0 Status.</b> Interested in using GCC 3.0? There's a 
instructive discussion on the Debian-Devel mailing list started 
by <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg01384.html">
Eray Ozkural</a> about the status of the GCC 3.0 packages in
testing. A note for newbies, GCC is the GNU Compiler Collection.
At one time it stood for GNU C Compiler, but GCC now supports 
a number of languages in addition to C. Some architechtures, such
as the IA-64 processor architechture, have been using GCC 3.0
from the get-go. The Debian releases for the x86 and other processors
will have to be migrated to GCC 3.0, which will be quite an 
undertaking.</p>

<p><b>Is that a Python in your pocket?</b> We're sure many Debian
Developers were glad to see the Python 2.0.1 GPL-compatible release.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0106/msg01485.html">
Gregor Hoffleit</a> has brought the transition topic up on the 
Debian-Devel list for discussion.</p>

<p><b>Debian Events.</b> There are four, count 'em, four events that
the Debian Project will be represented at in the upcoming week. 
The Debian Project will have a presence at exhibitions and conferences
in France, Germany, Mexico and the United Kingdom. You can find out
more about these events, and future events, on the Debian Events 
page: <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2001/">
http://www.debian.org/events/2001/</a>.</p>

<p><b>Security.</b> Just one security issue to report this week.
Michal Zalewski discovered a problem with Samba, namely that
Samba does not properly validate names from remote machines
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00067.html">
using NetBIOS</a>. Any Samba users will want to upgrade ASAP.</p>
