<p><b>Hurd F2 ISO Images</b> are now <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0105/msg00052.html">available</a>.
Get 'em while they're hot! For those folks who haven't heard of Hurd,
Debian GNU/Hurd is an OS based on the GNU Mach microkernel.  It's not
quite up to production quality, but if the idea of an OS based on a
microkernel interests you be sure to check it out.

<p><b>Bloated /etc</b>. /etc is supposed to be small, since it has to
be in /. However, some packages put some big files in there; samba has
it's codepages directory taking 2.5MB. Bill Allombert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0105/msg01250.html">raised
the issue</a>, and the general consensus was that this should be fixed
by moving some of those files from /etc to /usr/share.

<p><b>Debian-User Weekly FAQ</b>. This subject pops up from time to
time on the Debian-User mailing list, but this time <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0105/msg00022.html"> Yotam
Rubin</a> popped the question on the Debian-Doc list.  The Debian-User
mailing list sees quite a bit of traffic, but would a specific FAQ cut
it down any? The discussion hasn't come to a specific resolution yet,
but you can check out the regular <a
href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/">Debian FAQ</a>.

<p><b>Accessing Secure Sites with Mozilla</b>. Apparently, the Mozilla
package currently available in main is outdated, based on Milestone
18, while version 0.9 is now available. It also comes without support
for secure Web sites.  <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0105/msg00071.html">
Tham Kine Seng</a> got a quick response from several kind folks on the
list, and summarized instructions to install an "unofficial" Mozilla
package with security enabled.

<p><b>Using Public IP addresses in DMZ</b>. An interesting discussion,
with some helpful advice, popped up on the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-firewall-0105/msg00055.html">
Debian-Firewall</a> discussion list.

<p><b>Am I insane?</b> A lot of people on the Debian-User mailing list
were asking that question when the list suddenly received more than
100 messages in German on Saturday.  Apparently, someone had a news to
mail gateway misconfigured, but the problem seems to have abated
now. <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0105/msg03042.html">
Chris Cyll</a>, who's been studying too hard for German exams, was
particularly alarmed.

<p><b>New Packages</b>. Some of this week's most notable packages are
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/agrep">
agrep</a>, a text search tool with support for approximate patterns,
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/autotrace">
autotrace</a>, a package for converting bitmaps to vector graphics, <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/cowsay">
cowsay</a>, an absolutely vital program for turning text into happy
ASCII cows with speech balloons, and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/junior-programming">
junior-programming</a>, programming packages for kids, part of the
Debian Jr. project. There's also the HTTP compression module for
Apache, <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/libapache-mod-gzip">
libapache-mod-gzip</a> and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/scalemail">scalemail</a>
a scalable virtual mail domain system built with Postfix and LDAP.

<p><b>FAI 2.0 Released</b>. Another interesting program is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0105/msg00012.html">FAI</a>,
a program that performs a fully automatic installation of Debian on
one or more PCs. Thomas Lange made the announcement on the
Debian-Beowulf mailing list.
