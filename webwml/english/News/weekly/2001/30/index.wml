<p><strong>Licensing Something Other Than Software.</strong> Sunnanvind brought
up <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0111/msg00006.html">an old
issue</a> again.  The discussion covers the question of whether the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
(GNU FDL) is compatible with the DFSG and the philosophy of Free Software.
The GNU FDL allows the author to mark certain paragraphs as <em>invariant</em>
which could render the entire work non-free since it would fail the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> item 3.  Strict interpretation of the DFSG would
render many GNU Manuals non-free, because they contain invariant sections like
"Funding Free Software".</p>

<p><strong>Debian Menu Items.</strong> Karl M. Hegbloom <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00236.html">emphasized</a>
the need for package maintainers to add an item for the Debian menu system for
each and every X GUI application.  If programs aren't added to the menu
system, people often will not find the software at all.  The menu system is a
great development since it keeps menu items in sync with installed packages and
most X11 window managers benefit from it.</p>

<p><strong>Keywords For Debian Packages.</strong> Erich Schubert sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00253.html">proposal</a>
for using additional keywords for all packages.  The problem of organizing and
grouping Debian packages, now numbering in the thousands, is no longer merely
academic.  With the current size of Debian, only a few are able to keep track of
all the software available.  Even though experts have tools such as <code>apt-cache
search</code> at their disposal, newer or less experienced users commonly use
packaging frontends which lack a proper search interface.</p>

<p><strong>Very Old Intent to Package Requests.</strong> Taketoshi Sano
(&#20304;&#37326;&#27494;&#20426;)
analyzed the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/wnpp">bug tracking system</a>
with regards to Work-Needing and Prospective Packages (WNPP) and posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00329.html">report</a>.
WNPP is split up into <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">several
pages</a> on our web server for better readability.  However, the pages are
still large and Taketoshi revealed an impressive number of old requests.  The
problem remains: statistically, packages with ITP requests older than
six months tend to never be uploaded.</p>

<p><strong>Sourceforge a non-free Demo-Site?</strong> Although not directly
related to Debian, many users and developers of Debian use the <a
href="http://www.sourceforge.net/">SourceForge facility</a> for hosting the
development of software projects.  The <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">\
Free Software Foundation Europe</a> recently published a <a
href="http://fsfeurope.org/news/article2001-10-20-01.en.html">news article</a>
reviewing the past and current situation of <a
href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Linux</a> hosting and developing
SourceForge.  The article is worth reading.  Basically it says: SourceForge
has been a great help for Free Software devlopment, but it's time to "escape
entrapment". A while ago, the GNU project launched <a
href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a>, their own effort in providing
development resources to authors of free software, which uses a fork of the
Sourceforge code base.</p>

<p><strong>ATLAS Enables Massive Speedups in Mathematical Software.</strong>
Dirk Eddelbuettel wrote a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00823.html">report</a>
about great speed enhancements by simply using the Automatically Tuned Linear
Algebra Software (ATLAS) on unstable and testing.  With the current version of
the glibc library, <code>ldconfig</code> now loads the ATLAS optimised BLAS library without
any user intervention beyond installating the ATLAS and R or Octave packages.
Dirk demonstrated a very dramatic speed increase up to a factor of ten for a
sample matrix.</p>

<p><strong>No mplayer Packages In Debian.</strong> In recent times a lot of
people have asked about mplayer packages.  At the moment no packages for
mplayer can be included in Debian.  Even though the package basically is
licensed under the GNU GPL it uses non-GPL code, which doesn't fit together.
Additionally it is <a
href="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/unable-to-package">said</a> to have
patent issues which prohibit its inclusion as well.  In addition to these
problems the upstream developers do <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0111/msg00728.html">neither recommend
nor welcome</a> binary packages, since the source uses processor optimizations
defined at compile-time which they feel is important.  However, Christian
Marillat is providing <a
href="http://marillat.free.fr/dists/unstable/main/binary-i386/index.html">\
precompiled packages</a> privately.</p>

<p><strong>New Boot-Floppies 3.0.17.</strong> Adam Di Carlo told us that
Boot-floppies 3.0.17 have just been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0111/msg00458.html">released</a>.
Packages of the i386 version are in Incoming but should be available in the
archive and for other architectures over the new few days.  Adam calls for
help with (a) identifying any remaining release critical (RC) bugs in
boot-floppies, and (b) help in fixing the RC bugs we know about.  Those who
are interested should ask on <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Revealing The Secrets Of The Hurd.</strong> Neal Walfield, Debian
and Hurd developer, was recently <a
href="http://kerneltrap.org/article.php?sid=375">interviewed</a> at
Kerneltrap.  Neal explains the differences between classic Linux-like
operating systems and the Hurd, which tries to address certain design flaws of
current operating systems.  With respect to usability, the Hurd works quite
well as a desktop system, however, Neal would not yet recommend it to anyone
as a server.</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong>  The following packages were added
to the Debian archive since our last issue.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/devel/cvsgraph.html">cvsgraph</a>
    -- Create a tree of revisions/branches from a CVS/RCS file.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/electronics/gnucap.html">gnucap</a>
    -- GNU Circuit Analysis package.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/nocc.html">nocc</a>
    -- PHP web-based e-mail reader over POP3 or IMAP.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/nbtscan.html">nbtscan</a>
    -- A program for scanning networks for NetBIOS name information.
</ul>

<p><strong>Security Announcements.</strong> One security announcement reached
us this week.  You know the drill, if you use any of the affected packages be
sure to update them.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2001/dsa-086">ssh-nonfree</a>
    -- Remote root exploit.
</ul>

<p><strong>Got News?</strong> Keep us informed!  We don't want to miss it.  Be
sure to send us feedback and tips about new or old packages so we have an
opportunity to report on it in a subsequent issue.</p>
