<p><strong>Misdirected German Translation.</strong> We are awfully sorry, but
due to a mistake made by Joey the To: address was mistyped when he wanted to
post the German translation of the last issue of Debian Weekly News to the
German list.  Unfortunately it has been distributed to the international list
instead, causing some people to wonder what they're reading. Again, sorry for
that.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with Automake.</strong> A new version of automake has been
entered the unstable archive.  Unfortunately this version causes the build
system to behave like one could expect from the name - it's <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00492.html">unstable</a>.
Version 1.5 of automake is not backwards compatible to version 1.4, even
though that was a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00495.html">goal</a>.  As a
result of this a lot of packages cannot be compiled anymore, like all of KDE.
A solution is due soon.  Additionally, Neil Spring posted some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00646.html">statistics</a>
about building packages with automake 1.4 and 1.5.</p>

<p><strong>Long Perl Module Naming.</strong> The current policy with regard to
the naming scheme for Perl modules is quite clear: Foo::Bar becomes
<code>libfoo-bar-perl</code>.  This is fine for normal modules, however, there
are also modules available that contain <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/libbusiness-onlinepayment-bankofamerica-perl">\
Business::OnlinePayment::BankOfAmerica</a>, which in turn becomes
<code>libbusiness-onlinepayment-bankofamerica-perl</code> as package name.
This name is so long that it's a pain to type and <code>dpkg -l</code>
wouldn't display it entirely.  Joey Hess made a <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/114920">proposal</a> to remove foolish
consistency in Perl module names.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Conference 2 in Bordeaux?</strong>
The organisation of the <a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting
2002</a> has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0110/msg00053.html">begun</a>,
which will take place from July 9th to 13th, 2002. As in past years, it is 
possible to organise a Debian Conference at the same time but someone needs 
to lead the organisation of it. Last year Thierry Laronde was kind enough to 
work on it, but he can't organise another one this year. If you are interested 
please get in touch with org@lsm.abul.org.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling OpenOffice.</strong> Peter Novodvorsky
(&#1055;&#1077;&#1090;&#1103; &#1053;&#1086;&#1074;&#1086;&#1076;&#1074;&#1086;&#1088;&#1089;&#1082;&#1080;&#1081;) posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0110/msg00014.html">mini
HOWTO</a> describing how to get OpenOffice 638C compiled.  You'll need a newer
JDK from Blackdown.org and older STLPort packages.  Peter added a couple of
helpful links and patches to the document.</p>

<p><strong>Webalizer stopped Working?</strong> If you noticed that webalizer
from stable does not create website statistics anymore, you may be trapped
into <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0110/msg00123.html">this</a>.
Older versions of the Webalizer (version 1.30 through 2.00-12) generated
timestamps in a fashion that, on most platforms, would overflow on October 5,
2001.  The result is that statistics are generated up until midnight of
October 4th, but not after.  The current release of webalizer doesn't contain
this bug.  A patch against the version from stable is available, linked from
the mail above, as well as a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0110/msg00109.html">backport</a> of
the current version.  The maintainer also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0110/msg00180.html">prepares</a> an
upload of corrected packages for into stable.</p>

<p><strong>Branden got Heartburn.</strong> In our last issue we reported about
problems with SDL packages and Branden Robinsons attempt to fix them.  This
was suddenly interrupted by problems introduced by a new version of automake
(see above).  Finally Branden was able to fix the problems with the help of two
colleagues from <a href="http://www.progeny.com/">Progeny Linux Systems</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00675.html">uploaded</a>
NMU packages.</p>

<p><strong>Java 2 Standard Edition for Debian?</strong> Blackdown Java 2 was
recently uploaded targeted for non-free.  James Troup, our fearless ftp-master
would like some second opinions on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00024.html">license</a>.
An interesting term reads "do not distribute additional software intended to
replace any component(s) of the Software".  Presumably things like kaffe,
jikes and gcj constitute software intended to replace j2sdk, j2se, which makes
it difficult not to breach the above rule.  Stephen Zander <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00055.html">pointed out</a>
that Blackdown has been given permission by Sun to alter the terms of the
licence to allow the redistribution of Blackdown released binaries by
Blackdown mirrors and Linux distributions, not just Debian, regardless of
whatever else they may distribute.  Finally, these packages may end up in
non-free at least.</p>

<p><strong>New Apache2 Packages Delayed.</strong> Daniel Stone <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00686.html">announced</a>
that new Apache2 packages will hit the archive soon.  However, apache2 is
packaged in a different manner and uses a completely different directory
layout (for details, check the link above).  Too many people have raised
concerns about these changes resulting in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00759.html">delay</a>
uploading packages.</p>

<p><strong>Free Truetype Fonts?</strong> Erich Schubert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00059.html">contacted</a>
an author of some freeware and asked him, if he could licence them under an
open source licence.  His reply didn't exactly show that he read the provided
<a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>.  While
not being sure if the license would allow the inclusion in Debian/main a
discussion started on licensing artwork contrary to software.</p>

<p><strong>When Do Packages Get into Testing?</strong> A couple of <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00652.html">requests</a>
showed us that many people still aren't sure when a package is intended to
enter the testing distribution.  Anthony Towns posted an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00906.html">explanation</a>
about packages and testing.  The basic rule is that a package has to be tested
for two weeks (without critical bugs and new uploads) and that all of its
binary packages have been recompiled for all architectures that are scheduled
for testing.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting non-US in "crypto" And "patents"?</strong> Sunnanvind Briling
Fenderson came up with an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00047.html">idea</a> to
split the non-US archive up into a "crypto" and a "patents" piece.  Different
countries have different laws. This could terminate all the "put crypto 
in main" talk because US based entities could distribute "crypto" and "main",
while French (for example) could distribute "main" and "patents".</p>

<p><strong>Amicus Brief for Matt Pavlovich's Court Case.</strong> Branden
Robinson spoke with Allonn Levy on the phone a couple of weeks ago, and he
asked us to draft an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0110/msg00040.html">Amicus
Brief</a> ("friend of the court") document for submission to the California
Supreme Court, who are currently deciding whether to hear Matt's appeal on
jurisdictional grounds.  <a href="http://www.hsapc.com/">Levy</a> is Matt's
attorny in the DVD CCA v. Bunner, et al. suit.  The <a
href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> has <a
href="http://www.eff.org/IP/Video/DVDCCA_case/20010808_eff_pavlovich_pr.html">\
details</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Directions to Using Autoconf and Friends.</strong> Henrique de
Moraes Holschuh released a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0110/msg00773.html">document</a> in
which he describes how autoconf/automake is best used in Debian. The whole
GNU autotools stuff is a hairy topic, but if we don't document how to best use
them somewhere, it will only get worse.</p>

<p><strong>Debian is very Popular!</strong> Several readers wrote in to 
say that Debian came in second in <a 
href="http://www2.linuxjournal.com/lj-issues/issue91/5441.html">Linux 
Journal's Readers' Choice Awards.</a> Debian is moving up, having placed
fourth in the Awards last year.</p>

<p><strong>Good News...</strong> The W3C received enough 11th-hour negative
feedback to keep the odious proposed Patent Policy from sailing through.
Daniel J. Weitzner <a 
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-patentpolicy-comment/2001Oct/1559.html">\
announced</a> how the Policy Working Group will proceed. The most notable
change is the representation of the Free Software/Open Source community on
the Working Group. Bruce Perens (who should need no introduction) and Eben 
Moglen (General Counsel for the Free Software Foundation) will be joining
as "invited experts."</p>

<p><strong>Turnabout is Fair Play.</strong> The folks at <a
href="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> are 
always kind enough to post links to the latest DWN, and do a really fine
job of reporting news from and about the Linux Community so we thought 
we'd give them a mention this week. Given recent
cutbacks by Tucows, it looks like LWN might be in a bit of a pickle 
<a href="http://lwn.net/2001/1011/">financially</a>. They've set up a
<a href="http://vena.lwn.net/mailman/listinfo/discussion">discussion
list</a> to help think up ways that LWN might continue. If you're
just joining the discussion, please read the archives before throwing
in your suggestions. Not only is LWN consistently excellent, the crew
that puts it together are good people. We wish them luck.</p>
