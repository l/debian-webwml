<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian community.
</p>

<p>
Linux 2.4.0 is out, and unstable appears to support the new kernel without
many difficulties. The main source of problems is devfs. (** expand, get some
links **) Testing and stable do not really support 2.4 though
(20010105155400.A3023@shaitan).
</p>

<p>
<b>Watch out for the Debian tar SNAFU.</b> The -I switch in Debian's tar
program makes it use bzip2 for compression. However, in unstable the -j
switch enables this, and -I has an altogether different meaning. So a command
such as "<tt>tar cIf ...</tt>" might compress the file with bzip2, or might
create an uncompressed archive with no error message
(877l48vk1v.fsf@mose.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de), depending on the version
of tar that is used. Tar's NEWS file explains why this change was made --
compatability with Solaris's tar. Tar's upstream author is aware of the
problem (200101072037.MAA07856@sic.twinsun.com), so some sort of
backwards-compatabile fix might eventually appear.
</p>

<p>
<b>Lilo is also rather broken in unstable this week.</b> Lilo's maintainer
made some large changes (01010511183503.00874@lyta) to the way lilo is
configured, and the new package replaced <tt>/etc/lilo.conf</tt> with an
automatically generated and often broken file
(20010106133921.B12610@tardis.ed.ac.uk). The maintainer is working to
correct the problem (0101071500480F.05036@lyta).

<p>
<b>What's appropriate content for Debian changelogs?</b> Since bug reports
can be automatically closed by changelog entries, there have been some
clear instances of abuse of this feature, and other cases that are more
borderline. One such case is using the changelog to close a bug report when
no changes were actually made to the package, as was done in 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0101/msg00000.html">this glibc
changelog</a>. Whether that is ok is debatable, and 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0101/msg00024.html">debated it
was</a> -- fairly inconclusively. One thing the discussion made clear is
that thanks to automated bug closing and 
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/apt-listchanges.html">
apt-listchanges</a>, more and more people are reading Debian changelogs.
Write them with that in mind.
