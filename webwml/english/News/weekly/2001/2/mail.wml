Subject: News about Debian Conference... and have a happy new year!

Hello,

First, I'd like to wish you all a happy new year!

Here are some news about the Debian Conference 1.

The web site is finally online :

<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">http://lsm.abul.org/</a> [LSM site]
<a href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic20/">http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic20/</a> [Debian page, with a link to Arto Teräs'
report about the Zeroth Debian Conference]

There have been some improvements, but
for the Debian part we need now to define the skeleton of the subjects 
that are going to be dealed with.

First of all, the "Speech from the Throne" where we will hear about the
past, present and future of Debian : we do need to know where we are
going. After this, in the end of the evening we will take the first
photographs of Debian as an organization of real men ;)

After that the subjects proposed :

Debian as a meta-distribution ; the utils :
	- the Packages pools
	- Debian automatic installation tools
	- [with other distributions] a meta-description format allowing
	  semi-automatic generation of .deb or .rpm (or others...) as sketch
	  by Wichert Akkerman
	- massive installations and cluster built on Debian


Debian utils :
	- bootfloppies

Debian and Gnome/KDE

The HURD.

I still suggest a kind of course for new developers : how to do it the
"debian way", and how to use the debian packaging tools. If the
opportunity of the Debian Conference can be used to improve the
documentation in several areas (the text of the course), let's go !

The conference is yours : I'm here to offer opportunities, perhaps
suggest some topics, but _you_ will make the program. The discussions
will be held on debian@lsm.abul.org (to subscribe send a message to:
sympa@lsm.abul.org, with the subject: subscribe debian).

My work "in the real life" has just changed --- I work now with Libre
and for Libre software. But the struggle against software patents in
Europe (we are just about to be defeated) has taken me a lot of time in
the past months, and this remains one of my major concerns. So please 
forgive me if I'm sometimes slow to react.

Cu in Bordeaux,

Subject: resolution of the tar -I issue

I'm satisfied with this solution, and will work with Paul to deliver an
implementation for Debian as soon as possible.

&gt; 
&gt; After lots of discussion on the Debian developer mailing lists, the
&gt; solution that I think makes the most sense is:
&gt; 
&gt;         the -I option be removed from the documentation and usage messages
&gt; 
&gt;         use of -I becomes an error that communicates that -j is the right 
&gt;         option for bzip2, and -T is the equivalent of -I in Solaris tar
&gt; 
&gt; I think this meets everyone's needs.

OK, you talked me into this for the next tar version.  This will give
people time to switch.  We can then reintroduce -I as an alias for -T
in a later version of GNU tar.
