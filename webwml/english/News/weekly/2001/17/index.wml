#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="2001-07-18" SUMMARY="Bug counts up and down, LinuxTag and DebConf 1 summary"

<p> <b>Correction.</b> In the last issue, we said that IA-64 had been
using GCC-3.0 for some time.  This isn't true, it's HP PA-RISC which has
been using GCC-3.0 and only GCC-3.0.  Thanks to Bdale Garbee for the
correction.</p>

<p> <b>lcap support?</b> Christian Thäter is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0107/msg00024.html">proposing</a>
to add lcap (capabilities) support by default.  This might increase
security, since daemons will only be able to exercise the capabilities
which are given to them. </p>

<p> <b>Bugs, bugs and more bugs.</b> Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg01007.html">reports</a>
that we have an all-time high in the <a
href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">number of RC bugs</a>,
just as the freeze started.  This is mainly due to recent build
failures on ia64 and hppa.  Also, gcc-3.0 seems to have some issues,
at least on hppa.  The most important bugs are the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0107/msg00004.html">RC
bugs against base</a> and we have approximately one more week for
fixing them</p>

<p> <b>ASCII art.</b> Joey Hess forwarded <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg00686.html">a nice
piece of ASCII art</a>, the Debian Logo, from met.  In the true spirit
of debian-devel, people went about creating colorful versions of it.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0107/msg00861.html">One
of them</a> were made by John H. Robinson, IV.</p>

<p> <b>BugSquash!</b> A variant of the "common" bugsquashing parties
was held this weekend -- a Debian Architecture BSP.  Have a look at
the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0107/msg00001.html">announce</a>
and the <a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">bug
graph</a></p>

<p><b>LinuxTag's over!</b> At <a
href="http://www.debian.org/events/2001/0705-linuxtag">LinuxTag
2001</a> about thirty Debian developers and as many users have met at
the Debian booth and participated in the first <a
href="http://www.infodrom.ffis.de/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/day.php3">Debian
Day</a>.  This was a one-day conference organized by Debian developers
who gave talks about various issues for other developers and users.
The Debian Day was a great success and shall be repeated next year.
At the end of the schedule we've had a keysigning session organized in
order to improve everybody's web of trust.

<p>Although the Debian booth was even larger than last years booth, it
was still overcrowded most of the time.  Through sponsors we have had
the opportunity to produce <a
href="http://www.infodrom.ffis.de/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/cd.html
">special Debian CD-ROMs</a> to give away to visitors who wanted to
try out Debian GNU/Linux.  In addition to that the LinuxTag-Crew has
produced a <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">conference CD</a>
with a Linux system, which is running directly from CD-ROM without any
installation to the hard disk, based on Debian GNU/Linux.  About
17,000 people have visited this years LinuxTag, some 6,000 ended up
with a Debian CD in their bag.

<p>During the Debian Day Richard Higson gave a <a
href="http://pax.gt.owl.de/~higson/LinuxTag2001/Deb390-talk.html">talk</a>
about Debian GNU/Linux on <a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/s390/">IBM S/390 machines</a>.  The
porting on S/390 is going on well, a lot of packages (some 3000) have
been compiled for this architecture, a brute force build daemon is
running on a Multiprise 3000 hosted at <a
href="http://www.millenux.de/company">Millenux</a>.  This suddenly
lead into a notice of intention by some developers, some people
working for IBM and the Stuttgart based company <a
href="http://www.trustsec.de/">trustsec IT solutions GmbH</a>, who
plan to work on getting Debian GNU/Linux officially supported by IBM
on the S/390 architecture, alongside with other distributions.

<p><b>Release of the new unifont</b> announced by <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0107/msg00021.html">David
Sterner</a> on debian-i18n: the Unifont is a biwidth (8×16/16×16)
bitmap font, designed to provide coverage for all of Unicode. It
currently covers a large part of Unicode 3.0. Note that this version
of the Unifont only provides a single glyph for each character, making
it impossible to handle any language that needs context-dependent
character shaping well. It is supplied in the form of a hex file, with
a converter to convert it to bdf. See <a
href="http://czyborra.com/unifont/">http://czyborra.com/unifont/</a>.</p>

<p> <b>The first official <a
href="http://www.debian.org/events/2001/0704-debcon">Debian
conference</a></b> was held during the <a
href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting</a> (LSM) in
Bordeaux, France. 40 to 50 Debian developers and about 20 Debian users
attended the conference in order to discuss various issues and to
socialize.  Talks during the day stimulated many discussions which
were continued during the evening either while going to the city for
food or while hacking in the university computer rooms.</p>

<p><a href="http://people.debian.org/~rb/lsm/">Roland Bauerschmidt</a>
and <a href="http://www.james.rcpt.to/2001/conf-1.deb/">James
Bromberger</a> have taken pictures during the conference and Thierry
Laronde has organized to take a picture of the <a
href="http://www.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/~james/2001/conf-1.deb/5th-day/preview-114-1435_IMG.JPG.html">whole
group</a>. For those who want to read more about the conference and
see slides of the talks, Arto Teräs has written an <a
href="http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~ateras/travel/debian_conference/">extended
travel report</a> with many links to other sites.  Although the
conference is over, the discussions continue via the Internet and one
of the hot topics is currently where Debian Conference 2 is going to
be held.

<p><b>Newbie Tip-of-the-week</b>

Are you security-conscious? Good! Here's how you can
use apt-get to keep your potato system up-to-date with the
latest security patches: in <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> include
	those lines

<pre>
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-security potato/updates main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org/debian-non-US potato/non-US main contrib non-free
deb http://security.debian.org potato/updates main contrib non-free
</pre>

Thereafter, a quick <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code> is all you
need to keep the gremlins at bay.  </p>
