<p>Welcome to this year's seventh issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop/">debian-desktop</a> sub-project has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg01029.html">announced</a>
an IRC meeting on Wednesday, February 25th.  Andrea Mennucc <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00420.html">conducted</a>
several Google searches and found out that Debian is ranked in the middle
field of popular distributions.  Pablo Lorenzzoni also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0402/msg00003.html">\
announced</a> that <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf4/register/">\
registration</a> for this years' Debian conference has opened.</p>

<p><strong>New ftp-master Machine.</strong> James Troup <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0401/msg00011.html">\
announced</a> that <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/">ftp-master</a> has
been moved to a more powerful and better connected machine (newraff, an HP
DL380, donated by <a href="http://www.hp.com/">HP</a>), which has always been
a long term plan.  Therefore access to the host <code>auric</code> is not
restricted anymore, opening an upload queue that is accessible via SSH.</p>

<p><strong>Project Leader Nominations.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0402/msg00002.html">announced</a>
that nominations for the upcoming project leader elections takes place until
February 28th, followed by campaigning until March 20th.  The election will
take place from March 20th to April 10th.  Prospective leaders should be
familiar with the constitution.  Nominations should be sent to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/">debian-vote</a> and
cryptographically signed.</p>

<p><strong>Using LDAP for Name Resolution.</strong>  Torsten Landschoff
prepared this <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~torsten/ldapnss.html">how-to</a> on using
LDAP for name resolution.  It explains how to install the OpenLDAP server on
a Debian system, and how to set up OpenLDAP for use as an accounts database
with <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libnss-ldap">libnss-ldap</a> and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/libpam-ldap">libpam-ldap</a>.  Markus
Amersdorfer also wrote an <a href="http://aqua.subnet.at/~max/ldap/">\
article</a> about using OpenLDAP on Debian woody to serve GNU/Linux and Samba
users.</p>

<p><strong>JavaScript Libraries.</strong> Sebastian Ley <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00215.html">noticed</a>
that Debian ships at least two different JavaScript libraries: <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/libsmjs1">libsmjs</a> from spidermonkey and
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/libjs0">libjs</a> from <a
href="http://www.njs-javascript.org/">NJS</a>.  Renaming a library causes
problems for packages linking to it.  However, one library doesn't <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00230.html">use</a> a
library name (soname) from upstream.  Both libraries <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00231.html">provide</a> the
same functionality but a different programming interface.</p>

<p><strong>Translatable debconf Templates.</strong> Christian Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00251.html">announced</a>
the <a href="http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/~mquinson/debian/switch/">list</a> of
old-style debconf string techniques by Martin Quinson.  The listed packages
don't use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/po-debconf">po-debconf</a> for
debconf templates.  Denis Barbier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00266.html">noted</a> that
if maintainers provide a <code>templates.pot</code> file, they will receive a
French translation quite quickly.</p>

<p><strong>Why Linux, Why Debian?</strong> Manoj Srivastava wanted to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00594.html">solicit</a>
opinions towards this subject.  He knows why he chose Debian and Linux but was
asked to give a talk for a technical audience and wanted to deliver a talk
with a broader perspective.  He would like to cover why one would want to
select GNU/Linux over the BSDs, and why one would want to select Debian over
the other distributions.</p>

<p><strong>How to make a Port official.</strong> John Goerzen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00606.html">wondered</a>
what it takes a port to qualify an official Debian port.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00615.html">explained</a>
that currently porters need to wait until mirroring is segmented to support
more architectures.  To be considered a release candidate, the port should
generally have a buildd which is integrated into <a
href="http://buildd.debian.org/">buildd.debian.org</a> and consistently reach
at least the 85&nbsp;% mark, have a developer accessible machine online and
should have <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>
working.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental NTP 4 Packages.</strong> Matthias Urlichs <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00771.html">announced</a>
that he has uploaded <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ntp">NTP</a> 4.2.0 to
<code>experimental</code>, finishing some package reorganisation.  He also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00787.html">explained</a>
that most users either run their own NTP network and need to do hand-edit
<code>/etc/ntp.conf</code> anyway or can happily use <code>pool.ntp.org</code>
as their NTP server, which is the new default.</p>

<p><strong>Wasteful Packaging.</strong> Steve McIntyre <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00781.html">noticed</a>
that large <a href="http://people.debian.org/~93sam/waste.txt">amounts</a> of
data files in <code>/usr/share</code> are contained in regular binary
packages.  Instead they should be split out into common packages that all the
architecture specific packages can depend on.  Putting this data into all
binary packages impacts on disk space and bandwidth, both for central servers
and all the poor mirror admins out there.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Debian Distributions.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00801.html">asked</a> for
help with <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/CustomDebian">custom</a>
Debian distributions.  The <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">\
Debian-Edu</a> sub-project believes that using debconf with proper defaults is
the only sensible way that all <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/CustomDebianManifesto">custom</a>
distributions can benefit.  Thomas Viehmann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00821.html">added</a> that
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/debconf">debconf</a> is not intended as a
way to store stuff, especially if the package maintainer believes that
sensible defaults are shipped with the package.</p>

<p><strong>New DELAYED Upload Queue.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00888.html">announced</a> a
new delayed upload system in his home directory on gluck.  For a fairly
recent version of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/dput">dput</a> he also
provided a configuration snippet.  Uploads can be removed by the uploader and
superseded by an upload with a higher version number.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
