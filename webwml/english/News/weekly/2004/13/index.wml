<p>Welcome to this year's 13th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The next update to Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 is being <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r3/">prepared</a> together with a
discussion about the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb-0403/msg00004.html">Linux Standard
Base</a>.  Manoj Srivastava
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg01032.html">called</a>
for votes on the project leader <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_001">\
election</a> a second time.  Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC on April
10th.  Two US states <a
href="http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=18401422">\
proposed</a> an open source repository that would run on a Debian server.</p>

<p><strong>Editorial Amendments to the Social Contract.</strong> Manoj
Srivastava <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00964.html">\
announced</a> the formal discussion period on <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_003">editorial amendments</a> to the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>, giving people the chance
to propose amendments and modify wording, now that the non-free <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_002">general resolution</a> has passed.  The following
voting period shall be from Sunday, April 11th, to Sunday, April 25th.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.6 for Sarge?</strong> A user on <a
href="http://debianplanet.org/node.php?id=1068">Debian Planet</a> noticed that
it is quite unlikely for sarge to include GNOME 2.6, which has been <a
href="http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2004-March/msg00115.html">\
rescheduled</a> for March 31st.  This would be a pity, especially as KDE 3.2
has gotten in.  Ray Dassen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0403/msg00167.html">explained</a>
that GNOME 2.6 is being uploaded into experimental so that its release can't
delay the release of sarge.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project Leader Portraits.</strong> Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://www.gag.com/cgi-bin/blosxom/2004/03/25#2004.03.25">reported</a>
that <a href="http://www.artsmitten.com/">Elizabeth Gordon-Werner</a> is the
first person who ever painted him during one of his talks.  She has painted
watercolours of many speakers at 
last February's Open Source World Conference in
M&aacute;laga.  Included are portraits of the former project leader <a
href="http://www.artsmitten.com/gallery/people/det_oss6.htm">Bdale
Garbee</a> and current one <a
href="http://www.artsmitten.com/gallery/people/det_oss11.htm">Martin
Michlmayr</a>.</p>

<p><strong>UUCP and Sendmail.</strong> Peter Palfrader <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01660.html">noticed</a>
that the new <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sendmail">sendmail</a>
package has split off <a href="http://packages.debian.org/rmail">rmail</a>
which is required for processing mail via UUCP.  Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01671.html">requested</a>
that if something (B) is split out of a package A, the new version of A
should  depend on the new package B until after the next stable release,
since this is the only way to prevent breakage on upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel Source contains non-free Firmware?</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/239952">noticed</a> that Linux 2.6.4 contains
non-free <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01664.html">\
firmware</a> which is uploaded into the device by the kernel.  Herbert Xu <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01679.html">explained</a>
that in most of these cases the driver cannot communicate with the device in
any meaningful way until the firmware is loaded.</p>

<p><strong>User Accessible Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.</strong> Gary Greene
from Ark Linux <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02054.html">proposed</a> a <a
href="http://www.csis.gvsu.edu/~abreschm/uafhs/uafhs.html">standard</a> to
accommodate the accessibility of the filesystem by end-users.  Nicolas Mailhot
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02055.html">\
explained</a> why hidden files (and directories) are very bad
from a users point of view.  Henning Makholm <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02071.html">added</a> that
hidden directories are not compatible with the way <code>configure</code> can
be told to use a different prefix.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer on Oldworld Mac Hardware.</strong> Sven Luther <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0403/msg05990.html">reported</a>
about his work getting <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> to work on
oldworld powermac machines.  This does not only require a non-free compiler
but also a non-free and binary-only boot sector.  However, miBoot and the said
boot block used to sit around in the boot-floppies source code, without any
license or source code, as Jeremie Koenig <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0403/msg05999.html">pointed</a>
out.</p>

<p><strong>Creative Commons Attribution License.</strong>  Francesco Poli <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00267.html">wondered</a>
whether the <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/1.0/legalcode">Creative Commons
Attribution License 1.0</a> was considered free under the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>.
Nathanael Nerode at first <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00268.html">thought</a>
it was free, but upon reconsideration  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00286.html">decided</a>
it was not free.  Jeremy Hankins <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00291.html">noted</a>
that Creative Commons have not designed the license to be free, but rather to
maintain attribution by ensuring that people who see the license know about
the people who contributed to the work.</p>

<p><strong>Release Status Update.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00026.html">sent</a>
in an updated release progress report.  He asserts that <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> is holding up
fairly well.  The plan from now on is to release beta versions at roughly
monthly intervals.  He also reports that we want to freeze for as short a time
as possible and as soon as the installer schedule for a stable release is
absolutely clear.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-467">ecartis</a> --
