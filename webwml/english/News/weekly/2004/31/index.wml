<p>Welcome to this year's 31st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Erinn Clark <a
href="http://cytosine.org/~helix/lemonade/blog/dw_1.html">reported</a> that a
bit of content is now on the <a href="https://women.alioth.debian.org">Debian
Women</a> website.  Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00000.html">reminded</a>
maintainers to rebuild their packages if they depend on libtiff since the new
version has hit unstable already.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Update.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00003.html">\
reported</a> that no base and standard packages will be able to enter sarge
via unstable.  He said that we need to be fixing release critical bugs as
quickly as possible from now on, and that these bugs should not be staying
open for longer than a week.  Business card and network installation CD images of the
installer have been built, and full CD sets are building.  The installation
manual is also refined and prepared for release.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Retrospective.</strong> Joey Hess has <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_retrospective-2004-08-07-19-46.html">\
summarised</a> the events that have led to the current <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.  The saga began
in 2000 in a club in New York city where he met Adam Di Carlo.  He said that,
luckily, this project was never about coming in on time and under budget, but
about doing something "right".  According to <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/sloccount">sloccount</a> the installer contains
about 51 thousand lines of code, or 12 person years, which is quite
impressive.</p>

<p><strong>Compatibility Problem with Bash 3.0.</strong> Blars Blarson <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/261948">noticed</a> that bash 3.0, which was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00113.html">supposed</a>
to go into sarge has a stronger (POSIX compliant) syntax for the
<code>trap</code> built-in command and <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg02126.html">breaks</a>
compatibility with other Bourne-compatible shells.  At least <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/cnews">cnews</a> and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/sendmail">sendmail</a> are affected by
this.  Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg02131.html">asserted</a>
that the upload is too late for sarge anyway, so the problem only needs to be
fixed in unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Release Candidate 1.</strong> The Debian-Installer
team <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00004.html">\
announced</a> the first release candidate of the Debian sarge installer.
Significant improvements in this release of the installer include: support for
all 11 architectures, support for installing with the 2.6 kernel, support for
firewire CD drives and firewire Ethernet, translations into 40 languages,
numerous bug fixes and improvements and a lot more.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Problems.</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00507.html">spotted</a>
a problem in the libtiff transition for sarge.  Unfortunately, a new version
of <a href="https://packages.debian.org/libgpg-error0">libgpg-error0</a> was
uploaded to unstable with a new <code>shlibs</code> file a couple of days
after the version in sarge was frozen as part of the base freeze.  Hence,
packages not yet frozen that build against the new version won't be able to
enter sarge at all.  This <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00530.html">affects</a>
GNOME, Evolution at least.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Participation: Popularity Contest.</strong> Petter
Reinholdtsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00509.html">called</a>
for participation in the Debian <a href="https://popcon.debian.org/">\
popularity contest</a>.  The collected information is used as a measure to
calculate the order of packages for the official Debian CDs.  To make sure
this order reflects our user base, it is important that as many as possible
install and participate in <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/popularity-contest">\
popularity-contest</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Distributing Binary Blobs without Building.</strong> Shaun Jackman
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00593.html">\
wondered</a> if it was ok to distribute a binary file as provided by upstream
instead of compiling it from the accompanied source.  Roland Stigge <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00634.html">\
mentioned</a> the problems we run into if we need to patch the library
(e.g. for security updates).</p>

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
