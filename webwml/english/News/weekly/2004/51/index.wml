<p>Welcome to this year's 51st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Piotr Roszatycki <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg01992.html">reported</a>
that he has created preliminary packages for PHP5 already.  We would like to
thank all contributors and translators of this online resource who have helped
provide high quality information to our readers.  We are seeking more
contributions in order to be able to maintain DWN in 2005 as well.</p>

<p><strong>51 Issues of DWN produced this Year.</strong> You are currently
reading the 51st issue, which means that this is also the 51st week of
gathering information on interesting activities in the Debian community,
writing items, proofreading and translating.  Even though the English version
is prepared only by a small group of people, many more people are involved
before you can read the issue.  Each issue is sent to proofreaders, and
translators also improve it.  Each issue is also translated into several other
languages simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>Documenting transitional Packages.</strong> Javier
Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg01589.html">investigated</a>
the archive in order to provide a list in the <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/releasenotes">Release Notes</a> that can tell
users which packages in woody have been renamed or moved in sarge and can be
safely removed after an upgrade.  This information was part of the <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/woody/i386/release-notes/ch-appendix">documentation</a>
for woody already.</p>

<p><strong>Limiting the Number of Mails.</strong> Osamu Aoki <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00237.html">proposed</a>
to limit the number of mails per user per mailing list in order to help reduce
the noise in discussions.  Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00242.html">pointed
out</a> that lists need to be treated differently.  He would rather like to
see more lists moderated, and the moderators given power to stop threads after
they have become off-topic.</p>

<p><strong>Depending on a real RSH Client.</strong> Wolfgang Borgert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02104.html">discovered</a>
a problem in an unofficial Debian package.  Due to the use of an older
embedded system the package depends on a real rsh client.  Since the package
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/ssh">ssh</a> provides an
<code>rsh-client</code>, adding a dependency to this is not sufficient.
Wouter Verhelst and Miquel van Smoorenburg <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02105.html">pointed</a>
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02106.html">out</a>
that a versioned dependency will do the trick, since it can only be resolved
by a real package.</p>

<p><strong>Individual Package Optimisation.</strong> Julien Danjou <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02107.html">translated</a>
a short French <a href="http://shaddai.nerim.net/apt-build/">article</a> about
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-build">apt-build</a> by Julien Reveret
into <a href="http://julien.danjou.info/article-apt-build.html">English</a>.
This package intends to mitigate the alleged advantage Gentoo has over Debian
with regards to optimised packages.  It makes it easy for interested user to
recompile Debian packages with different compiler options.</p>

<p><strong>Volatile Status Update.</strong> Andreas Barth sent in another <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg02138.html">status
update</a> about the volatile archive and reported that it is ready to have
packages uploaded.  New packages should be discussed on <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> first and always
include the original source archive.  He mentioned the general rules for this
archive as well.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Issues with the (L)GPL.</strong> Michael K. Edwards <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00209.html">forwarded</a>
three issues.  He wondered if the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(GPL) is more an offer than a contract, if it is violated when the source code
is unobtainable and whether a vendor of non-free software can require users to
particular versions of libraries released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.  Nathanael Nerode <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00220.html">tried</a> to
answer these questions.</p>

<p><strong>MIA Database Coding Request.</strong> Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/12/msg00023.html">asked</a> for
help with coding up some extra features in the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/mia/?cvsroot=qa">MIA database management</a> in
Python.  Basically he would like to be able to add configurable delays and
hints on a per-maintainer basis for the MIA (missing in action) tools.</p>

<p><strong>New Entities for the Installation Manual.</strong> Frans Pop <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/12/msg00973.html">proposed</a>
to introduce more SGML entities for the new installation manual.  This would
ensure that the same terms and spelling would be used in all places of the
manual and in all translations.  It is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/12/msg00979.html">unclear</a>,
however, if this is possible in all languages.</p>

<p><strong>Release Notes Translations needed.</strong> Rob Bradford <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2004/12/msg00029.html">called</a>
for translators for the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/ddp/manuals.sgml/release-notes/?cvsroot=debian-doc">\
release notes</a> for the upcoming release of sarge.  Several replied and
committed to translating the document into their own language.  New
translations should be sent to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/">debian-doc</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for Stable Update.</strong> The next <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/12/msg00183.html">stable
update</a> is being <a href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r4/">\
prepared</a> and expected before New Year's eve.  It will consist only of
corrections for about the last 60 security problems that the security team
addressed and fixed with <a href="$(HOME)/security/">advisories</a>.  This
update will get the woody release in sync with the latest security
updates.</p>

<p><strong>Rewriting GFDL Documentation.</strong> Frank Küster <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00232.html">\
wondered</a> if it was possible to rewrite the GNU Emacs manual starting with
an older version since it has recently been released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
(GFDL) which has been <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml">\
considered</a> (preliminary) non-free by Debian.  Florian Weimer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/12/msg00234.html">pointed
out</a> that even the Emacs 18 manual contained a permission notice that
honoured invariant sections.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 615: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-615">debmake</a> --
    Insecure temporary directories.
<li>DSA 616: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-616">netkit-telnet-ssl</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 617: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-617">tiff</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 618: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-618">imlib</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
</ul>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following packages were
added to the unstable Debian archive <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/newpkg_main">recently</a> or contain
important updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/comm/asterisk-chan-capi">asterisk-chan-capi</a>
    -- Common ISDN API 2.0 implementation for Asterisk.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/comm/asterisk-config">asterisk-config</a>
    -- Config files for asterisk.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/tspc">tspc</a>
    -- Client to configure an IPv6 tunnel to freenet6.
</ul>
