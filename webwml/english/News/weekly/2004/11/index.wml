# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's eleventh issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Ludovic Brenta <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00428.html">proposed</a> a
new task for Ada development for <a href="https://packages.debian.org/tasksel">\
tasksel</a>.  Apparently, SPAM has <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00847.html">closed</a> a
bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/190721">report</a> again, so people should
watch the bug reports they opened.  Manoj Srivastava <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00853.html">called</a> for
votes the <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_002">general resolution</a> to
handle non-free and reported that 303 developer have already voted.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and KDE used at 2300&nbsp;m.</strong> KDE France <a
href="http://www.kde-france.org/article.php3?id_article=115">reported</a>
about the use of Debian and KDE used in the highest Internet access center at
2300&nbsp;m in the ski resort Val Thorens.  Debian was chosen since it is well
suited for installing customised systems.  Generating and distributing system
packages is very simple with <code>apt-get</code> and a custom repository,
they reported.</p>

<p><strong>New Proposal to distribute non-free.</strong> Ean Schuessler <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0403/msg00284.html">proposed</a>
to use certificate authorisation to protect users from non-free software from
Debian servers but provide those certificates to other distributors for
signing a contract that indemnifies Debian against damages.</p>

<p><strong>Delays in the Init Scripts.</strong> Shaul Karl <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00270.html">proposed</a> to
discourage the use of delay statements in the stop target of init scripts in
order to save time when shutting down the machine.  Miquel van Smoorenburg <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00283.html">pointed</a> out
that not waiting for database servers to terminate properly could harm the
database and destroy its data.</p>

<p><strong>Running Debian from USB Flash?</strong> Jeff Johnston <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00363.html">pondered</a>
running Debian GNU/Linux from a USB flash device since they don't have any
moving parts.  Those have up to 1&nbsp;GB of capacity and therefore can well
take an operating system.  Steinar Gunderson, however, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00365.html">pointed out</a>
that flash devices usually have a more or less fixed number of writes before
they start to break.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with Subversion License.</strong> Warren Turkal <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00132.html">noticed</a>
that subversion has some clauses in its license which seemed questionable to
him.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00137.html">asserted</a>
that the license itself  is free in the Debian sense but GPL-incompatible at
the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Bugs via LDAP.</strong> Andreas Barth was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00388.html">working</a> on
the LDAP gateway to the Debian <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bug tracking
system</a> and <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00008.html">\
recreated</a> it.  In order to provide an intuitive interface he has already <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00480.html">created</a> a
preliminary <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~aba/bts2ldap/debian-bts.schema">schema</a>
which will probably use the Debian OID space in the future.  Adam Heath is
also <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00416.html">\
working</a> on a new and extensible index format which can be used by this
gateway.</p>

<p><strong>Installation reports needed.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0403/msg01355.html">asked</a> for
people to report their experiences using the new <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> on the mips,
powerpc, ia64, hppa, sparc, and s390 architectures.  He asserted that he is
close to releasing at least 6 architectures.  He is also looking for someone
who is prepared to debug base-installer to take a look at the i386 netboot
issues.</p>

<p><strong>Why supporting old Hardware?</strong> Konstantinos Margaritis <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00851.html">asked</a> if
Debian should support all architectures in parallel or establish some kind of
"speed lanes".  Martin Michlmayr <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00852.html">explained</a>
that Debian will support them as long as there is interest.  Also, by auto
building the entire archive on those platforms, Debian helps testing GCC,
XFree86 and the kernel.  This way, Debian has reported a lot of bugs
(especially toolchain bugs), which leads to better free software.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on Sun Starfire.</strong> Fabio Massimo Di Nitto <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc-0403/msg00007.html">reported</a>
that he was able to <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~fabbione/e10k/debian_on_e10k.txt">install</a>
Debian on a Sun <a
href="http://www.anysystem.com/sunen10e24x4.html">Enterprise 10000</a> server
via NFS-Root at <a href="http://www.tbit.dk/">Ericsson Telebit A/S</a>.  Such
a Starfire <a
href="http://www.sunstuff.org/hardware/systems/sun4/sun4u/ULTRAEnterprise10000/">\
machine</a> contains up to 64 CPUs and can run several operating systems at
the same time.  This machine, however, only uses 4 CPUs with Linux together
with 4&nbsp;GB of RAM.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at CeBIT 2004.</strong> The Debian project will be present
at this years' <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0318-cebit">CeBIT</a> at the booth
of <a href="http://www.linuxland.de/">LinuxLand</a> (Hall 6, booth B52,
subbooth 469), a German distributor of Debian GNU/Linux.  Additionally,
Michael Meskes will deliver a talk about the migration to Free Software.
Hauke Goos-Habermann and Daniel Kasten will give a <a
href="http://www.ltt.de/logon-briefings.2004/cebit/march.20/tutorials.shtml#T1p">\
tutorial</a> about setting up a LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) system with
Debian.  Klaus Knopper will deliver a talk about <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> and Frank Ronneburg will
give a talk about software management with Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<p><strong>Ordering Packages on Sarge CDs.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00009.html">\
asked</a> for participation in the <a href="https://popcon.alioth.debian.org/">\
popularity contest</a> by installing the <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/popularity-contest">popularity-contest</a>
package and say yes to participate.  Petter asserted that sarge will probably
ship with 13 binary CDs filled up with about 13,500 packages and that the
contest will be used as criteria to order the packages on the last eleven
CDs.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Squashing Party.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00012.html">\
announced</a> a bug squashing party next weekend (March 19-21).  Coordination
will take place on the IRC channel #debian-bugs on irc.debian.org.  He also
felt that Debian is clearly making progress towards sarge (see the rc bug <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">count graph</a> and the
progress on the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
debian-installer</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Beta 3.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0403/msg01796.html">announced</a>
the third beta <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2004/7">\
release</a> of the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
debian-installer</a> with 6 architectures.  This release features the new
partitioner that supports automatic partitioning and LVM and uses <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/grub">grub</a> as boot-loader on i386.
PowerPC had to be dropped in the last minute due to non-working compilers,
though.  Debian needs test installations and reports sent to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> list.</p>
