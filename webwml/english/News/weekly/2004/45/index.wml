<p>Welcome to this year's 45th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Bruce Perens has written an <a
href="http://technocrat.net/article.pl?sid=04/11/08/1640206">article</a> on
software patents in standards and explains how they hinder software
development.  It seems that the memory consumption problem in SpamAssassin 3
is finally <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00283.html">\
fixed</a>, so the package may be able to migrate into sarge.</p>

<p><strong>Release Status Update.</strong> Colin Watson sent in a new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00003.html">\
release status update</a> in which he reported that two more people are
helping with release management and that the toolchain has been finalised.
However, several architectures still face upgrade problems with regards to the
kernel and glibc.  He also revealed that sarge will be released with KDE 3.2.
The key blocker, though, the buildd network, hasn't been adjusted to
testing-security yet.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.8 for Sarge?</strong> On behalf of the GNOME team Jordi
Mallach <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/11/msg00067.html">\
wondered</a> if he may upload GNOME 2.8 into unstable since it was released
early in September already when sarge was said to be frozen really soon.
Since it has received a lot of testing and many users are already using it
through the experimental distribution, it seems to be suited for the new
stable Debian release.  The release team has since then <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/11/msg00107.html">approved</a>
the upload of GNOME 2.8.1 into unstable, which may migrate in parts or as a
whole into sarge as well.</p>

<p><strong>Digging into the Installer.</strong> Ingrid Marson <a
href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39173518,00.htm">\
interviewed</a> David Pashley about the new <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">Debian installer</a>, which focuses on
an easy installation.  Even though the installer is still text-based some
developers are working on a graphical interface.  Anthony Awtrey added that
the Installer supports automation by allowing to pre-seed a configuration with
all the options managed by the Debian configuration system.</p>

<p><strong>Large Opteron Cluster running Debian.</strong> Thomas Lange <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf/2004/11/msg00010.html">\
reported</a> about the new AMD Opteron cluster <a
href="http://www.hpc2n.umu.se/resources/sarek.html">Sarek</a> at the Umeå
University.  It consists of 192 nodes (384 CPUs), was installed with <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> (Fully Automated
Installation) and runs the pure64 port of Debian GNU/Linux for amd64 with a
2.6 Linux kernel.  This cluster was even listed at rank 165 on the top <a
href="http://top500.org/lists/plists.php?Y=2004&amp;M=06&amp;TB=2">500
list</a> of June 2004 and at rank 220 in <a
href="http://top500.org/lists/plists.php?Y=2004&amp;M=11&amp;TB=3">\
November</a>.</p>

<p><strong>YaST2 for Debian?</strong> Mario Fux was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00160.html">looking</a>
for somebody to port YaST2 to Debian.  It's an overall configuration utility
which seems to be missing in Debian.  Jaldhar Vyas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00161.html">answered</a>
that he planned to check whether he can package YaST2 for Debian.  He also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00166.html">mentioned</a>
a YaST2-frontend to debconf.</p>

<p><strong>Help for Upstream Software Authors.</strong> Adrian von Bidder <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00181.html">started</a>
to document <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SoftwarePackaging">hints</a> for
upstream authors which will make the work for package maintainers easier.  The
idea is not to duplicate the Debian policy, but to give upstream developers an
idea how their software can be written to be easily packaged.</p>

<p><strong>Mounting removable Media.</strong> Martin Pitt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00201.html">reported</a>
about the idea of upstream about automatic USB/FireWire device handling.
Since he is not satisfied with this he has developed <code>pmount</code>,
which can be executed by a normal user to mount removable media.  He would
like to propagate this approach to Debian.</p>

<p><strong>PHP Accelerator undistributable?</strong> Andres Salomon <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/11/msg00078.html">noticed</a>
that turck-mmcache, a precompiler and cache to improve performance of PHP
scripts, is covered under the GNU GPL but links against PHP4, whose license is
incompatible with the GNU GPL.  Since this renders the package undistributable
by Debian, an interested user is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/11/msg00090.html">seeking</a>
a license change.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 592: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-592">ez-ipupdate</a> --
    Format string vulnerability.
