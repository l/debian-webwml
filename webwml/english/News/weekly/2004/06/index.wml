# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's sixth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Since supporting UTF-8 in Free Software takes quite some
time, several people started the <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/Software/utf-8">project UTF-8</a> for
evangelisation and documentation of proper Unicode (and most specifically
UTF-8) support in Free Software.  The core of the <a
href="http://www.jabber.org/">Jabber</a> protocol, the Extensible Messaging
and Presence Protocol, has been <a
href="http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/ietf-announce/Current/msg28170.html">\
proposed</a> as an <a href="http://www.ietf.org/">IETF</a> (Internet
Engineering Task Force) standard.</p>

<p><strong>LILO Support for Device Mapper.</strong> Andrés Roldán <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02169.html">added</a>
preliminary <a href="http://people.fluidsignal.com/~aroldan/debian">\
support</a> for device mapper block devices to <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/lilo">lilo</a>.  The Linux kernel device
mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management) Team's implementation of a
minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles volume management, while keeping
knowledge of the underlying device layout in user-space.</p>

<p><strong>Optimising your Filesystem.</strong> Roderick W. Smith <a
href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/10/07/1943256">discussed</a>
several filesystems for Linux and their special features like support for
journals, reserved blocks, check intervals, block sizes, directory hashes and
i-node options.  He also mentions that on rare occasions, an ext3 journal may
become so corrupted that it interferes with disk recovery operations.  In such
cases, one can convert the filesystem back into an ext2 filesystem using the
<code>debugfs</code> tool.</p>

<p><strong>KDE Support in UserLinux.</strong> Bruce Perens <a
href="http://lists.userlinux.com/pipermail/discuss/2004-January/003492.html">\
clarified</a> that <a href="http://www.userlinux.com/">UserLinux</a> will
provide commercial support for <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> after
some confusion.  However, KDE is not the chosen GUI of the UserLinux project.
Bruce also said that Qt doesn't fit their licensing policies because it's
putting the GPL in a place where he would prefer to put the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
License</a> so that proprietary development can take place without a
commercial license.</p>

<p><strong>Library depending on Data Files.</strong> Sebastian Ley was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00049.html">seeking</a>
advice on how to organise a library package that depends on data files.
Originally, these data files would be placed in the same directory for all
libraries, but that would circumvent parallel installation of different
versions.  Thomas Viehmann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00051.html">suggested</a>
to use version specific directories.  Colin Watson also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00119.html">explained</a>
that several versions of the library should be installable to reduce upgrade
problems.</p>

<p><strong>GCC Transition Status.</strong> Nathanael Nerode <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00060.html">noticed</a>
that the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~willy/gcc-transition/">\
transition status</a> is online again.  It shows that there are only 46 source
packages still compiled with g++ 2.95 without intentional exceptions like Qt2.
All libraries have been converted.  Matt Zimmerman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00067.html">supplied</a>
the list of packages still missing.</p>

<p><strong>Aging of "experimental" Packages.</strong> Phil Edwards <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00064.html">wondered</a> if
packages in the "experimental" distribution are properly aged, as <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/developers-reference/resources#experimental">\
described</a> in the Developer's Reference manual.  It says that the
"experimental" packages are automatically removed once the package in unstable
has a higher version number.  James Troup <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0402/msg00070.html">explained</a>
that this is currently based on source packages with exactly the same
name.</p>

<p><strong>Voluntary Writers needed for the Hurd.</strong> Lucas Nussbaum <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0401/msg00067.html">complained</a>
that documentation for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a> is
difficult to find and scattered all over the Internet.  He also asserted that
many parts of the system are not even documented and many howtos are broken.
He offered to help reorganise the Hurd end-user documentation, to add links
and to suppress redundancy between them.</p>

<p><strong>XFree86 License Problems.</strong> The new <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/legal/licenses.html">license</a> proposed by the
XFree86 team is likely to be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00284.html">\
incompatible</a> with GPL like Paul Cannon outlined if linking is considered
to create derived works.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00296.html">explained</a>
that it is the licenses on GPLed works that would be violated, not the license
on XFree86, so it's the interpretation of the authors of the GPLed works that
counts.</p>

<p><strong>Closure of main.</strong> Adam Majer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00068.html">asked</a> how
to interpret &quot;must not require a package outside of main&quot; from the
<a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive#s-main">policy manual</a>.
Joel Baker <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00070.html">\
explained</a> that it means that the dependencies of a package must be
satisfiable in main alone.  Hence, a single non-free package as alternative to
free packages in main does not harm.  Steve Langasek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0402/msg00071.html">added</a> that
the same is required from &quot;Recommends&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Hurd within Bochs.</strong> Lucas Nussbaum <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0401/msg00078.html">managed</a> to
create a <a href="http://packages.debian.org/bochs">Bochs</a> image for Hurd.
Bruno Bonfils' <a href="http://www.asyd.net/docs/hurd/bochs-hurd.html">\
document</a> about setting up <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">\
GNU/Hurd</a> and Bochs was helpful as well as the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0303/msg00065.html">description</a>
about the same by Julien Puydt.  Lucas concluded that these documents were
helpful but not sufficient, though.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Support for UTF-8.</strong> Nikolai Prokoschenko
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0402/msg00095.html">proposed</a>
to configure the second-stage installer to use UTF-8 since the first-stage
installer already uses UTF-8.  This would make UTF-8 de facto the default
encoding.  Alastair McKinstry <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0402/msg00097.html">explained</a>
that UTF-8 can also be a regression since one loses the ability to do compose
characters (eg. accents).</p>

<p><strong>Status of Debian/NetBSD.</strong> John Goerzen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0401/msg00001.html">asked</a> about
the state of the NetBSD <a href="$(HOME)/ports/netbsd/">port</a>.  Matthew
Garrett <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0401/msg00002.html">\
explained</a> that there are two ports indeed: one uses the NetBSD base system
while the other one favours the GNU C library.  However, not many people are
working on them.  There has even been work on sparc and alpha ports, since
NetBSD does support many more architectures and sub-architectures than
Linux.</p>

<p><strong>International Free Software Forum and Debian Conference.</strong>
The Brazilian <a href="http://www.softwarelivre.org/">Projeto Software
Livre</a> called for <a href="http://papers.softwarelivre.org/">papers</a> for
the 5th International Free Software Forum which will be held from June 3rd to
5th in <a href="http://www.portoalegre.rs.gov.br/">Porto Alegre</a>.  The
forum is purely academic and has well-defined topics.  It takes place right
after this years' <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf4/">Debian
Conference</a> which will be held in Porto Alegre from May 26th to
June 2nd.</p>
