<p>Welcome to this year's 30th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Debian's 11th birthday is near (August 16th), and, so
several parties are planned.  Pablo Lorenzzoni <a
href="http://hackers.propus.com.br/~pablo/blog/?id=34">announced</a> that the
<a href="http://www.debian-br.org/">Brazilian Debian community</a> have
postponed the celebrations to August 21st.  Holger Levsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/08/msg00002.html">invited</a>
all interested bodies to celebrate on Castle Hohenholz, 100&nbsp;km north of
Berlin and 30&nbsp;km far away from Szczecin (Stettin).</p>

<p><strong>Improved Debian Developer Packages Overview.</strong> Igor Genibel <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/07/msg00017.html">\
announced</a> an improved <a href="https://qa.debian.org/developer.php">\
packages overview</a> page. It now contains links to <a
href="http://dehs.alioth.debian.org/">upstream watch information</a>, <a
href="http://bjorn.haxx.se/debian/">excuse analysis</a> by Björn Stenberg.
Information is generally displayed in UTF-8 as well.  Some information can be
hidden as well, configured stateful via cookies.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Package Removals.</strong>  Because of the approaching freeze
of sarge, the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/">\
debian-release</a> list has seen a flurry of "please remove foo from sarge"
requests.  Typically, such packages are still undergoing extensive upstream
development and are not yet ready for
a stable release.  Steve Langasek
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/07/msg00107.html">asked</a>
that such requests be accompanied by a release critical bug report with
details on why the package should not be included in sarge.</p>

<p><strong>OSCON Talks</strong>  Jay Lyman
<a href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/07/30/1436242">reviewed</a>
talks given by three Debian developers at this year's <a
href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2004/">O'Reilly Open Source
Conference</a>. Bdale Garbee spoke about community development and noted that
people are surprised when something comes from amateurs because not many
people recognise what they can do.  Jeff Licquia described Progeny's model of
componentised GNU/Linux. Jeff Waugh discussed the future of GNOME.</p>

<p><strong>New RFH Tag for orphaned Packages.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00000.html">\
announced</a> a new "request for help" tag for the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">Work Needed and Prospective Packages</a> for <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/help_requested">packages</a>.  This tag is meant for
situations in which the current maintainer wants to continue maintaining the
package, but needs some help to do this, because his time is limited or the
package is quite big and needs several maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Timeline.</strong> Steve Langasek posted another <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00001.html">\
release update</a>.  There are still several major bugs in the base system
that are being worked on.  When the base system gets frozen, CD images of <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> release candidate
1 will be made available within a day or two.  On August 8th
official security support for sarge is said to begin with the number of
release critical bugs dropped by 100.  The timeline predicts them to drop to
zero on September 1st, followed by the release on September 15th.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian GNU/Hurd Installation Method.</strong> Michael
Banck <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2004/08/msg00006.html">announced</a>
a new installation method for the Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/">GNU/Hurd port</a>.
It uses the <a
href="http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-hurd/2004-02/msg00108.html">xattr-hurd
support</a> for ext2 by Roland McGrath <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2004/10/">mentioned</a> earlier.
Using his <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~mbanck/xattr-hurd/kernel-patch-xattr-hurd_20040302-5_all.deb">kernel
patch</a> and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/testing/utils/star">star</a>, one can
extract a <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~mbanck/xattr-hurd/gnu-latest.tar.bz2">base
tarball</a> and get a working Debian GNU/Hurd system immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Status of GNOME 2.6 in Sarge.</strong> Jordi Mallach wrote an <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.6-sarge-2004-08-03-02-18">\
update</a> on GNOME 2.6 in sarge.  <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gnome-applets">gnome-applets</a> and a number
of other less important packages depending on <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/libgtop2">libgtop2</a> has finally made it
into testing.  The only two remaining packages that keep the metapackages for
GNOME 2.6 out of testing are <a href="https://packages.debian.org/eog">eog</a>
and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/gnome-games">gnome-games</a>.  The
latter package will take a while since it is affected by several release
transitions currently ongoing.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Squashing Parties.</strong> With the release of sarge coming
closer and closer, bug squashing parties become more important in order to
reduce the number of release critical bug reports and to stabilise the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.  Martin
Zobel-Helas <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2004/07/msg00113.html">\
announced</a> a bug squashing party from August 20th to 22nd in Darmstadt,
Germany.  Debian people from Europe and Germany are invited to participate
this event.</p>

<p><strong>Versioning and Stabilising of Debtags.</strong> Enrico Zini <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00007.html">wondered</a>
how he should handle the libraries for debtags properly.  The debtags codebase
is getting fairly stable and he is planning to release version 1.0.  Andrew
Suffield <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00020.html">\
asserted</a> that no shared libraries should be uploaded for binary interfaces
(ABI) that are not yet stable enough.  Enrico would also appreciate people to
help him with packaging.</p>

<p><strong>Introducing Debian Lieutenants?</strong> Glenn McGrath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg00054.html">wondered</a>
if the Debian project needs a structural change, and maybe Lieutenants who
would be located between the project leader and maintainers.  He asserted that
Debian is more a "team of champions" than a "champion team" and that it is
difficult to change something which does not lay within one's own
responsibility.</p>
