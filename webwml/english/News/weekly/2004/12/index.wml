<p>Welcome to this year's 12th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  If you ever wanted to switch from Debian GNU/Linux to SuSE
Linux, you should read this <a
href="http://www.novell.com/coolsolutions/nnlsmag/features/tips/t_suse_forums_nls.html">\
howto</a>.  This <a
href="http://www.thejemreport.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=113">\
article</a> will attempt to dispel some myths and clear a few things up for
those interested in finding more information on GNU/Linux.  While most people
in the Free Software community already know this stuff, outsiders only know
what they read in the news and hear from others.</p>

<p><strong>FOSDEM Reports.</strong> Wookey and Stefan Gybas <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0221-fosdem-report">reported</a> about the Embedded
Debian and Debian Java projects that met with other people during the Free and
Open Source Software Developers' Meeting in Brussels.  Both groups gave a talk
giving an overview and explaining the current status.  The Embedded Debian
project was significantly advancing their plans to make Debian a really useful
distribution for small machines as well as large.  Besides better
collaboration with Gentoo and FreeBSD the Debian Java developers also had a
lot of <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0403/msg00004.html">\
technical discussions</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Towards an MPlayer Resolution.</strong>  Diego Biurrun <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00235.html">posted</a>
an update on the work being done to resolve MPlayer's licensing difficulties.
The main two concerns have been the lack of a LICENSE file and noncompliance
with clause 2a of the GNU General Public License, which Diego has attempted
to address through a LICENSE file and a Copyright file.  Don Armstrong <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0403/msg00243.html">thought</a>
it would suffice for Debian's purposes, but suggested that the MPlayer team
should indicate in the relevant files that they've been changed and who
changed them.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project Leader Election.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00894.html">called</a> for
votes for the Debian Project Leader <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_001">\
Election</a> 2004.  Votes must be received by 23:59:59 UTC on April 10th,
2004.  The voting period may have to be extended by roughly 15 hours because
Manoj wasn't able to send out the call in time.  The platforms of <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/platforms/tbm">Martin Michlmayr</a> <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/platforms/algernon">Gergely Nagy</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/platforms/branden">Branden Robinson</a> are
online.</p>

<p><strong>Re-affirming non-free Components.</strong> The <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_002">vote</a> on the General Resolution on the
status of the non-free section is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0403/msg00920.html">\
determined</a>.  The non-free section was re-affirmed.  163 developers voted
for its removal, whereas 260 developers voted for the re-affirmation.  482
developers took part in this vote.</p>

<p><strong>Regular Bug Squashing Parties and weak Freeze.</strong> Adrian Bunk
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01033.html">proposed</a>
a weak freeze in the near future so that no new upstream versions may be added
to the testing distribution.  Additionally there should be regular bug
squashing parties to help reduce the number of release-critical bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Linux 2.6 on Debian 3.0.</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01316.html">announced</a>
the availability of <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/packages/woody/kernel-26.html">packages</a>
to run Linux kernel version 2.6 on Debian woody.  They are taken from unstable
and were recompiled on woody.  Hence, they may not be as stable as the
packages in woody.  Although these packages should help to use kernel 2.6 on
Debian 3.0, complete support for all kernel 2.6 features is not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Report from the Bug Squashing Party.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0403/msg00196.html">reported</a> about the
bug squashing Party last weekend.  It was quite successful since the small
<a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/djpig/4378.html">group of
participants</a> produced a lot of fixed packages, patches and solutions.
He also talked about the used methods of
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~djpig/bsp.html">coordination</a> and
requests input by others on some topics for future bug squashing parties.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel Packages Cleanup?</strong> Adrian Bunk released a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg01334.html">proposal</a>
to clean up the kernel packages in unstable.  Since supporting 2.2, 2.4 and
2.6 is insane he asked if an architecture still requires 2.2 at all.  He also
proposed to remove various kernel-patch packages that add random features,
which are present in newer kernels since they can't be supported in a stable
Debian release.</p>

<p><strong>Menu based Init Configuration.</strong> John Hasler <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg00980.html">announced</a>
that he has uploaded <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sysvconfig">\
sysvconfig</a> into experimental.  This is a text-oriented menu-based utility
for configuring init scripts.  This package can render the system unbootable,
though, and hence should be used only with care.  John is interested in bug
and success reports, of course.</p>

<p><strong>OSCAR running on Debian.</strong> Members of the <a
href="http://www.openclustergroup.org/">Open Cluster Group</a>, an informal
group of people dedicated to making cluster-computing practical ported <a
href="http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/">OSCAR</a> (Open Source Cluster
Application Resource) on Debian IA-64.  They <a
href="http://oscar.openclustergroup.org/tiki-index.php?page=OSCAROnDebian">\
introduced</a> an abstraction layer so that both at the package level (rpm or
dpkg) and at the distribution level (updaterpm, yum, urpmi and apt-get) OSCAR
can run on systems that don't use rpm as a packaging tool using exactly the
same code base.</p>

<p><strong>Running Debian at 3.7&nbsp;GHz.</strong> Alexander Schmehl <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0318-cebit-report">reported</a> about the
fastest x86 system at this year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0318-cebit">\
CeBIT</a>.  Its manufacturer <a href="http://www.h2o-computer.de/">H2O</a>
approached the Debian booth to find out whether GNU/Linux would run on that
machine.  The entire installation was done in less than 15 minutes with the
slow 48x CD-ROM drive being a bottleneck.  With Linux reporting 7372.9
Bogomips and glxgears reporting 4540.8&nbsp;fps, that's quite a nice working
environment.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Usability Review.</strong> Marcus Thiesen <a
href="http://www.thiesen.org/d-i/index.html">reviewed</a> the latest Beta 3 of
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> in terms of
usability from an average users perspective.  The new debian installer is a
good way to set up ones favorite distribution.  Nonetheless he discovered a few
usability gotchas.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-465">openssl</a> --
    Multiple vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-466">Linux 2.2.10</a> (powerpc/apus) --
    Local root exploit.
</ul>
