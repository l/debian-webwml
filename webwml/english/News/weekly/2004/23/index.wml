<p>Welcome to this year's 23rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Library Packaging Guide.</strong> Junichi Uekawa <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00069.html">\
announced</a> an updated Debian library packaging <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html">\
guide</a>.  He has added an <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html#SHAREDVERSIONLIBHOWTO">\
example</a> on making versioned symbols for shared libraries.  This update is
done in response to Steve Langasek's presentation at <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0526-debconf">Debian Conference</a>.  Stephen Frost
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00077.html">\
provided</a> additional information.</p>

<p><strong>Canonical List of Contributors.</strong> Scott Dier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00095.html">\
pondered</a> how Debian should acknowledge its contributors since this was
discussed during <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0526-debconf">Debian
Conference</a>.  He suggested to compile a list of contributors, consisting of
Debian developers, people who provided patches, ideas and translated strings,
people and organisation that sponsored conferences or hardware.  Rob Taylor <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00104.html">suggested</a>
to have a policy on mentioning people in changelog files who contributed
patches.</p>

<p><strong>Managing Packages with GNU Arch.</strong> Jérôme Marant is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00146.html">\
interested</a> in managing his packages with GNU <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/tla">arch</a> and how to maintain the
package repository.  At least two approaches and maintenance utilities exist
to accomplish these.</p>

<p><strong>Naming the AMD64 Architecture in Debian.</strong> The architecture
formerly known as <code>amd64</code> has officially been named <code>\
x86-64</code> by <a href="http://packages.debian.org/dpkg">dpkg</a>
developers.  Scott James Remnant <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00177.html">pointed</a>
out that other vendors don't name it <code>amd64</code> and that this is not
the official GNU name for the architecture either.  This causes problems for
both preliminary Debian ports, though.  Steven Frost <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00184.html">pointed</a>
out that the decision about the arch-names is
not of the authority of the dpkg team and that the patch was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00212.html">backed
out</a> for now.</p>

# From: Mark van Deursen <mark@forums.debian.net>

<p><strong>Debianplaza Portal growing.</strong> Some Debian users across Europe
started a Debian portal for Debian users who use our favorite
distribution as a hobby.  <a
href="http://forums.debian.net/">Debianplaza</a> is a friendly
community site which aims at starters as well as home users who like to
know a little more about Debian. The increasing member list indicates
there's still a need for information in plain English. The site provides
a forum, news and information.</p>

# From: "Grzegorz Prokopski" <gadek@debian.org>

<p><strong>Free Java on more Platforms.</strong> A user <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java/2004/06/msg00004.html">asked</a>
why the current <a href="http://www.sablevm.org">SableVM</a> (1.1.5) packages
are uninstallable in unstable.  SableVM maintainer Grzegorz Prokopski
explained that the debs of class libraries for this version got stuck
for a few days in the NEW queue and pointed to a temporary unofficial <a
href="http://gadek.debian.net/debs/">repository</a>.  He also
mentioned that this version is able to run Ant 1.6.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Firebird Maintainers Group.</strong> Grzegorz Prokopski <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00258.html">\
announced</a> an <a href="http://firebird.debian.net/">effort</a> to build a
maintainer group for <a href="http://packages.debian.org/src:firebird">\
Firebird</a> packages for Debian.  He asserted that he cannot maintain the
packages anymore but can help others to maintain them.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging Binary and Library.</strong> Tommaso Moroni <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00273.html">\
wondered</a> how to best package <a
href="http://www.rkeene.org/files/oss/dact/release/">dact</a> since it
provides an executable program and a library.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00299.html">\
asserted</a> that anything that goes in /usr/lib directly must be in a package
on its own since soname changes would <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00352.html">cause</a>
breakages otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-512">gallery</a> --
    Unauthenticated access.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-513">log2mail</a> --
    Format string vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-514">Linux 2.2.20</a> (sparc) --
    Local root exploit.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-515">lha</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-516">postgresql</a> --
    Denial of service.
</ul>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following packages were
added to the unstable Debian archive <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/newpkg_main">recently</a> or contain
important updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/epiphany-extensions">epiphany-extensions</a>
    -- Extensions for Epiphany web browser.
</ul>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages.</strong> 4 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer.  This makes a total of 166 orphaned packages.  Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community.  Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">WNPP pages</a> for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.</p>
