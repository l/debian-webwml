<p>Welcome to this year's 34th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  In an <a
href="http://www.linuxgames.com/?dataloc=articles/ttimo/">interview</a>, id
Software's Timothee Besset confirmed that he loves the Debian distribution.
In a different <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=7314">review</a> Leo Spalteholz
described how he tried to escape Debian and switch to an "easier"
distribution, but ended up with Debian again.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting the Packages File.</strong> Daniel Ruoso <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01221.html">wondered</a>
how he could keep a 486 with 8&nbsp;MB RAM updated in unstable with only PPP on the
serial line.  He proposed to split the <code>Packages</code> file into
sections so that clients can operate on smaller files.  Peter Eisentraut <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01234.html">asserted</a>
that with more than 30 sections this would make the <code>sources.list</code>
file unmaintainable.  He added that most but very specialised clients would
probably need to include all sections anyway.</p>

<p><strong>Standard 2.4 kernel for Sarge?</strong> Dann Frazier <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00381.html">\
proposed</a> to use 2.4.27 as the 2.4 kernel for all architectures with 2.4
kernels in the upcoming release.  The strongest <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/08/msg00632.html">\
argument</a> is that this version supports several architectures natively and
binary packages for all architectures supporting 2.4 are already available.
Joey Hess contributed a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00389.html">d-i kernel
update checklist</a> and Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00405.html">agreed</a>
that this is the way to go.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Cloaks on Freenode.</strong> Göran Weinholt <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/08/msg00136.html">\
announced</a> that he is a group contact for Debian on the <a
href="http://freenode.net/">freenode</a> IRC network.  He is currently the
only one and is supposed to be some sort of relay between the Debian project
and the freenode staff. His main reason for volunteering for this position is
so that we can get cloaks working for all interested Debian developers whose
nickname is <a href="http://freenode.net/faq.shtml#nicksetup">\
registered</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Update.</strong> Steve Langasek sent in an <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/08/msg00017.html">\
update</a> on the upcoming sarge release.  Several library transitions were
finished and brought GIMP 2.0 to sarge, among other packages.  Instead of only
a flurry of new and fixed packages it was more like a snowstorm, keeping
the buildd network busy.  The number of release critical bugs is lower than
last time, but not as low as hoped.  Hence, there is progress towards the
release, but it is going slower than expected.</p>

<p><strong>What's new in Sarge?</strong> Bartosz Fenski <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01487.html">asked</a>
about the most important changes between woody and sarge.  Kevin McCarty <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01495.html">named</a>
several packages that will be updated to a newer version or added.  Among others these
are GNOME 2.6, KDE 3.2, GIMP 2, Firefox and Thunderbird, Linux 2.6 and
OpenOffice.org.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasing Upstream Development...</strong> Daniel Burrows <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01527.html">wondered</a>
if he should request the removal of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/noteedit">noteedit</a>, a music editor for
KDE, since upstream has decided to cease development.  He has already orphaned
the package, so it's not properly maintained in Debian anymore either.  Roland
Stigge <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/08/msg01601.html">\
mentioned</a> the nice list of import and export formats and reminded people
that a package in a stable Debian release isn't changed a lot during its lifetime.</p>

<p><strong>Outdated Packages for contrib and non-free.</strong> Jeroen van
Wolffelaar <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/08/msg00399.html">\
reminded</a> maintainers of packages in contrib and non-free, that they are
responsible for getting all supported architectures in sync.  More recent
versions of these packages won't be able to be released at the same time as
sarge otherwise.  These packages cannot be auto-built.</p>

<p><strong>Debian experimental Kaffe runs Tomcat4 on PowerPC.</strong> Arnaud
Vandyck <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/avdyk/6508.html">wrote</a>
that the free Java environment has reached an important milestone.  He
asserted that although free Java environments are not as full as proprietary
ones, in some cases, they are far better.  After experiencing multiple
problems with IBM's proprietary JDK on the PowerPC architecture he managed to
get the free environment running Tomcat4.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux on the Desktop.</strong> KDE Developers Kévin Ottens and
Peter Rockai <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1093794087/">spoke</a> about their
work on the <a href="http://www.kalyxo.org/">Kalyxo</a> project, which aims to
improve KDE integration on Debian systems as well as making KDE and non-KDE
applications work well together.  They are working on a common look and feel
as well, which is why they packaged the <a
href="http://www.kalyxo.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/GtkQtEngine">qt-gtk-engine</a>
for Debian users.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-542">Qt</a> --
