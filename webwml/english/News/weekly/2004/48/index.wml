<p>Welcome to this year's 48th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Frank Ronneburg has updated his <a
href="http://debiananwenderhandbuch.de/">book</a> about Debian to cover the
upcoming release of sarge and will <a
href="http://www.lob.de/cgi-bin/work/pages?id=Dvj09C3PcRVB&amp;page=Bernd1">present</a>
it on December 14th in Berlin, Germany. <a href="http://www.europcar.com/">\
Europcar</a> has <a
href="http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/linuxunix/0,39020390,39175484,00.htm">\
switched</a> 1,500 computers in branch offices to Debian based thin clients,
and is now moving 3,500 more machines in headquarters to GNU/Linux.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Babe and non-US?</strong> After Thibaut Varene <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00986.html">declared</a>
his intention to package <a href="http://dindinx.net/hotbabe/">hot babe</a>, a
small application showing different pictures (of a drawn girl) depending on
the CPU temperature, a discussion about which packages should be part of
Debian started.  The question came up how to handle packages that are against
the law in some countries.  Paul Hampson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg01042.html">wondered</a>
if non-US should be reactivated for such packages.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Update.</strong> Andreas Barth sent in another <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/11/msg00015.html">\
status report</a> about the sarge release progress.  He reported that GNOME
2.8 was accepted while KDE 3.3 still has issues that need to be resolved
before its addition can be discussed.  The main blocker of the release is
still missing infrastructure, though.</p>

<p><strong>Package Lists via LDAP.</strong> Sean Finney <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg00290.html">stated</a>
he has 
worked on implementing a alternative package list structure using the <a
href="http://www.openldap.org/faq/data/cache/29.html">Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol</a> (LDAP).  Applying search filters on <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg00329.html">timestamps</a>
would make package list updates a lot faster, but <code>apt</code> is
currently designed with the assumption that it fetches the list of packages
in the same manner that it fetches the packages themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Does Sarge really matter?</strong> Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier <a
href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/index.php?p=56">wondered</a> if it
really matters whether or when Debian releases the sarge distribution as
official release.  He added that the official release date doesn't really mean
anything, since sarge is already widely in use.  He emphasises on one of the
nice things about Free Software which is immediate availability.  Andreas
Barth <a href="http://blogs.turmzimmer.net/2004/12/06#why-release">\
responded</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Preseed URL via DHCP.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01525.html">noticed</a>
that the kernel boot parameter space is too limited on HPPA to provide a
preseed URL for Debconf and <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
debian-installer</a>.  Steve Langasek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01532.html">added</a>
that the DHCP server is able to distinguish between classes which would make
it possible to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01543.html">\
overload</a> a common option.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian-Installer Branch.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01344.html">\
announced</a> that he has created a special development branch for the
debian-installer sarge will use.  The main  trunk is now open for post-sarge
changes.  This means that the installer for sarge is more or less frozen.
Christian Perrier additionally <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/11/msg01347.html">urged</a>
developers to avoid string changes.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives for su-to-root?</strong> Grant Diffey <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00728.html">proposed</a>
to use the alternatives mechanism for programs that provide su-to-root
functionality.  Nikita Youshchenko <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00735.html">asserted</a>
that the programs he listed do different things.  Wouter Verhelst even <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/mail2.html">added</a> that
the fact that <code>gksu</code> is used from the menu system instead of
<code>gksudo</code>, means that one cannot conveniently use <code>sudo</code>
in graphical environments.</p>

<p><strong>Finding an Improved Release Process.</strong> Lex Hider <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00887.html">started</a>
a discussion on alternatives to the current Debian release process which lead to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00893.html">\
comments</a> on what stable actually means, the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00914.html">size</a> of
Debian and the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00946.html">\
increasing</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/11/msg00969.html">\
complexity</a> of the dependency tree.  Joey Hess eventually created a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.net/index.cgi?ReleaseProposals">wiki page</a> for
release proposals and current bottlenecks to be discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Package Dependencies.</strong> Daniel Burrows <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg00391.html">reminded</a>
other developers of the proper way to add a dependency (or recommendation) to
a purely virtual package.  He emphasises that it should be an OR dependency
with a real package proposed as well so that <code>apt-get</code> doesn't
install an arbitrary package that fulfils this dependency which may result in
a lot of packages that neither the user nor the maintainer intended to get
installed.</p>

<p><strong>Character Encoding in Control Files.</strong> Peter Samuelson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg00521.html">noticed</a>
that most non-ASCII characters in the <code>control</code> file are UTF-8
encoded.  However, some characters aren't but <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ap-pkg-sourcepkg.html#s-pkg-dpkgchangelog">\
policy</a> only talks about character encoding in the changelog files.  Denis
Barbier <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/12/msg00550.html">\
opted</a> for manual fixes instead of simply passing the lines in question
through <code>iconv</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 603: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-603">openssl</a> --

    Information leak.
</ul>
