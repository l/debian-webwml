<p>Welcome to this year's 37th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  A recent issue of the German computer magazine c't features
an article about GNU/Linux on notebooks including a test of 14 current
notebook models.  One machine, an ASUS M2400N, came pre-installed with
Debian GNU/Linux by <a href="http://www.xtops.de/">Xtops.DE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security-Hardening Debian.</strong> <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/debianhardened">Debian Hardened</a> is a
new project that <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00126.html">wants</a> be
an official Debian <a href="$(HOME)/devel/">sub-project</a>.  It aims at
providing a complete tree of hardened kernel and software packages for a
standard Debian distribution, without changing to another distribution like <a
href="http://www.trusteddebian.org/">Adamantix</a> and making easy the
hardening of any machine running Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu 4.10 Preview released.</strong> Benjamin Mako Hill <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/102248/">announced</a> the first beta release of
<a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/">Ubuntu Linux</a> (codenamed "Warty
Warthog").  The new distribution is based on Debian and features GNOME 2.8 and
is available for the x86, AMD64, and PowerPC architectures.  Ubuntu plan a new
release every 6 months, with 18 months of security updates for each <a
href="http://www.netsplit.com/blog/work/canonical/ubuntu_and_debian.html">release</a>.
The <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/relationship/document_view">\
relationship page</a> provides a few details on their release process.</p>

<p><strong>Updating Scanners and Filters in Debian stable.</strong> Joey
Schulze <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00795.html">\
asked</a> about means to update the database of virus and security scanners,
spam filters and the like for the upcoming Debian release.  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00788.html">Nessus</a>,
and ClamAV use special plugins to update their databases, and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00793.html">f-prot</a>
uses an installer package.  Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00801.html">proposed</a>
to modify the stable update policy instead.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining SSL Certificates.</strong> Kai Hendry <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00955.html">wondered</a>
why he should build his own certification authority (CA) since <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">SPI</a> runs a CA and could be issuing
certificates to make Debian users' life easier.  Javier Fernández-Sanguino
Peña <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00974.html">\
explained</a> that SPI is not a CA, but only use certificates for their own
use and close projects.</p>

<p><strong>Open Software License v2.1.</strong>  Matthew Wilcox <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00179.html">started</a>
a new discussion on version 2.1 of the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/osl-2.1.php">Open Software
License</a> after version 2.0 was not  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/05/msg00118.html">considered</a>
free according to the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>.  Anthony DeRobertis <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00220.html">asserted</a>
that the new version is still not free and is conform with the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/09/msg00182.html">opinion</a>
of Andrew Suffield.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and Global File System?</strong> An <a
href="http://newsvac.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/09/09/028214">article</a>
on Newsforge reported that the Angelo Ovidi has <a
href="http://xfdeb.sourceforge.net/">released</a> the first unofficial Debian
kernel packages supporting Global File System (GFS) on a 2.6.8.1 vanilla
kernel.  GFS supports journaling, recovery from client failures, and many
other features.  Bastian Blank has already built and uploaded the first set of
<a href="http://lophos.multibuild.org/svn/cluster/">official packages</a>
to unstable, only one package is waiting in the incoming
queue.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Source Packages in Sarge.</strong> Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/09/msg00210.html">noticed</a>
that several source packages are missing in the corresponding
<code>Sources</code> file.  This means that there is no trust path from the
archive signing key, nor will it be possible to build the same version with
<code>apt-get -b source</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Installer Release Candidate Planning.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/09/msg00291.html">noticed</a>
that the new <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> is
in a relatively good shape for another release.  He would like to declare a
new release candidate soon and tried to formulate a group goal for the <a
href="http://meeting.ffis.de/Oldenburg2004/">developers meeting</a> in
Oldenburg, Germany, this week, so that all developers can work on a common
task.</p>

<p><strong>Weekly CD and DVD Builds.</strong> Santiago Garcia Mantinan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/09/msg00081.html">announced</a>
that he is automatically building weekly CD and DVD images for sarge again.
They now use <a href="http://www.einval.com/~steve/software/JTE/">JTE</a> to
allow for faster image generation.  Because of the changed creation process,
the new images may contain new bugs, so please report any problems to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd</a> mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Notes.</strong> Rob Bradford <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2004/09/msg00033.html">announced</a>
that the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/">release notes</a> for sarge have
finally been written.  Translators who have formerly been disappointed by the
lack of an English version can start translating the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/ddp/manuals.sgml/release-notes/?cvsroot=debian-doc">\
document</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LSB Status in Sarge?</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb/2004/08/msg00002.html">wondered</a>
about the status of <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/">Linux Standard
Base</a> (LSB) in Debian sarge.  Jeff Licquia <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-lsb/2004/08/msg00004.html">explained</a>
that he is working on LSB 2.0 already and that he anticipates issues only with
the dynamic linker, glibc, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/diff">diff</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/coreutils">coreutils</a> and the <a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-545">cupsys</a> --
    Denial of service.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-546">gdk-pixbuf</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-547">imagemagick</a> --
    Buffer overflows.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-548">imlib</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-549">gtk+2.0</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-550">wv</a> --
    Arbitrary command execution.
</ul>

also know about, send it to <a
