<p>Welcome to this year's 43rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Adrian von Bidder <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01627.html">noted</a>
that mirroring Debian via rsync uses quite some CPU-power on the server and
hence is not the preferred method.  Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01516.html">reported</a>
that some of the SourceForge servers are <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=1052417&amp;group_id=1&amp;atid=350001">\
moved</a> from Debian 2.2 (potato) to a current release of Fedora for <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01659.html">marketing
reasons</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Report from the Systems Presence.</strong> Michael Banck <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mbanck/diary.html?start=25">\
summarised</a> the Debian presence at this year's <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/1018-systems">Systems</a> exhibition.  The Debian
project maintained a booth along with other Free Software projects like
Skolelinux, KDE, OpenOffice.org and the various BSDs.  Despite NetBSD being
around as well, the Debian booth had the coolest piece of hardware, namely a
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~mbanck/photos/systems2004/p1010068.jpg">Mac
SE/30</a>, running Debian stable on a Linux-2.2 kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Report from Kansai OpenSource.</strong> Junichi Uekawa wrote a <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/diary/200410.html.en#2004-Oct-24-18:26:21">\
report</a> about the Debian meeting during this year's <a
href="http://k-of.jp/">Kansai OpenSource</a> on October 23rd in Osaka, Japan,
where about 30 Debian associates met.  They gave an introduction talk about
Debian in general, a talk about becoming a maintainer and the day-to-day
tasks.  The meeting ended with a panel discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Mailing Lists Slowdown.</strong> Pascal Hakim <a
href="http://www.redellipse.net/stuff/Debian/Lists/debian-announce_and_thundering_herds.story">\
reported</a> that Debian's mailing lists were hurt by a number of mail servers that don't
accept mail fast enough. Additionally, a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-2004/msg00000.html">\
mail</a> to the announce mailing list with more than 28,000 subscribers
aggravated the problem.  He also announced the addition of <a
href="http://cord.de/">Cord Beermann</a> to the listmaster team.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel and Sarge Upgrade.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/10/msg00430.html">published</a>
the results of his first (successful) dist-upgrades from woody to sarge
with a real i386. Andreas Barth <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/10/msg00450.html">summarised</a>
the issues for all platforms.  Beside real i386 there might be upgrade
problems on hppa, arm, sparc and mips(el) due to incompatibilities between
glibc and the kernel.  For some of them, it's sufficient to upgrade the kernel
first.</p>

<p><strong>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 2.3.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01543.html">compared</a>
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) 2.1, which is used for the release of sarge with
the next <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html">version 2.3</a>.
Some changes in 2.3 will required modifications in the
archive. Some people wondered if 
<code>~/Desktop</code>, which is created by GNOME, would still be allowed in the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01590.html">future</a> or <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01648.html">not</a>,
even though this behaviour was generally disliked.</p>

<p><strong>Release Critical Bug Reports.</strong> Cord Beermann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01449.html">noticed</a>
that the list of RC-bug reports was considered as junk by the
mailing lists recently, and didn't make it to the lists any more. This
is fixed now. Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01549.html">asked</a>
to trim this report down to bugs affecting sarge for now, and Colin
Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01561.html">told</a>
to look into, but can't promise when. Additionally, Andreas Barth <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/278869">reported</a> that the list also included
bugs tagged experimental, which is fixed now.</p>

<p><strong>Public secrete Keyrings.</strong> Matthew Garret <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01643.html">noticed</a>
that the secret keyring to access the wanna-build database for Debian's AMD64
port was publically <a
href="http://ftp.belnet.be/linux/debian-amd64/wanna-build/secring.gpg">\
available</a> and detectable via <a
href="http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl%3Asecring.gpg">Google</a>.  Adam
Majer reacted fast and immediately <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01657.html">revoked</a>
this archive key since it had to be considered compromised.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Updates via BitTorrent.</strong> Arnaud Kyheng <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg01715.html">started</a>
with an <a href="http://sianka.free.fr/">apt proxy</a> to the bittorrent
network.  For security, the package listing and the .torrent files will be
fetched from a regular HTTP server, just as usual for a package.  Packages,
however, will be fetched via the bittorrent protocol and forwarded to apt.
Some earlier <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/199316">ideas</a> were mentioned
in a bug report before.</p>

<p><strong>License for Content of Web Forums.</strong> Sebastian Feltel <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00434.html">wanted</a>
to change the license for new postings on <a href="http://debianforum.de/forum/">\
debianforum.de</a> that are submitted after January 1st next year to the
MIT/X11 license and wondered about potential problems with two licenses
present.  Changing the license on old postings would be an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00483.html">\
never-ending</a> task, since he had to ask all ~5,000 users who have
contributed.  Finally Sebastian <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00546.html">\
modified</a> the code so that users can choose the license they want to
use.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging the new 2.6.9 Kernel?</strong> Andres Salomon <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/10/msg00355.html">reported</a>
that he has prepared the required patches for the 2.6.9 kernel in the kernel
repository.  However, Christoph Hellwig <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kernel/2004/10/msg00357.html">suggested</a>
to get 2.6.8 in a better shape for sarge first.  Andres wanted to provide the
2.6.9 also for comparison and as a resource for backporting patches.</p>

<p><strong>New Skolelinux CD Image 1.0r1.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2004/10/msg00386.html">announced</a>
a new Skolelinux CD <a href="ftp://developer.skolelinux.no/skolelinux-cd/">\
image</a>.  The new image incorporates many of the recent security updates, a
kernel upgrade and some new translations.  The hardware detection database was
updated as well.  Skolelinux also recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2004/10/msg00384.html">won</a> an <a
href="http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/news_archive/skolelinux/2004/best_newcomer_distro">\
award</a> in Germany.</p>

<p><strong>Cross-compiling the Kernel on Debian.</strong>
Al Viro <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/4098">explained</a>
how he uses Debian to cross-compile the Linux kernel for a
number of different architectures.  All compile runs are
done on a K7 and two AMD64 machines.  He is also set up to
cross-compile for sparc32, sparc64, alpha and powerpc.  As a
result any compile-time errors on those other
architectures are quickly caught.</p>

<p><strong>Debian CD/DVD Directory Layout.</strong> Steve McIntyre <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/10/msg00145.html">reported</a>
that he finally has a full set of woody (3.0) DVD jigdo files and wondered
about the directory layout on the server.  He <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/10/msg00149.html">proposed</a> a
particular layout that would require moving the existing jigdo files.  Richard
Atterer <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/10/msg00148.html">\
asserted</a> that for sarge full DVD images would be available on cdimage for
i386 only and that's how it should be implemented for woody as well.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 574: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-574">cabextract</a> --
    Unintended directory traversal.

    Temporary file vulnerability.
<li>DSA 576: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-576">squid</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li>DSA 577: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-577">postgresql</a> --
    Symlink vulnerability.

    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 580: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-580">iptables</a> --
    Modprobe failure.
<li>DSA 581: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-581">xpdf</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 582: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-582">libxml</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
