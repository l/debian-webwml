<p>Welcome to this year's fifth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Most true Unix geeks will recognise just how nice <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/lprng">lpd</a> is as a distributed queueing
mechanism for managing all jobs sent to the printer, but don't realise it can
be used for other things as well.  In fact, it can be viewed as a general
queueing mechanism and used as an <a
href="http://patrick.wagstrom.net/weblog/archives/000128.html">engine</a> for
distributed spooling of audio files.  The January issue of the German <a
href="http://www.linux-user.de/">LinuxUser</a> magazine shipped with <a
href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a>, Debian 3.0 and sarge on two <a
href="http://www.linux-user.de/DVD/">DVDs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project at European Conferences.</strong> The Debian project
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2004/20040131">announced</a> that its members and
affiliates will attend three exhibitions and conferences that cover Free
Software and GNU/Linux in Europe.  From February 3rd to 5th <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0203-solutionslinux">Solutions Linux</a> takes place
in Paris, France.  On February 16th and 17th <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0216-linux-expo-ulm">Linux Expo Ulm</a> will take
place in Ulm, Germany.  Finally on February 21st and 22nd <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0221-fosdem">FOSDEM</a> will take place in Brussels,
Belgium, where the Debian project will share a developers room with another
project and organise a mixed schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Debian fastest growing Distribution.</strong> Over the last six
months Debian has been the fastest <a
href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/01/28/debian_fastest_growing_linux_distribution.html">\
growing</a> GNU/Linux distribution when measured by counting active sites that
contain the name of a distribution in the Apache Server header.  A
distribution name is present in a little over a quarter of Linux based Apache
sites.  In January 2004 <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>
counted 442,752 Apache servers running on Debian, a 25&nbsp;% growth rate from
355,469 counted in July 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Report from Practical Linux and Dresden InfoTag.</strong> Alexander
Schmehl wrote a <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1011-plgiessen-report">report</a>
about Practical Linux in Gießen, and a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1018-lit-dresden-report">report</a> about
LinuxInfoTag in Dresden, both in Germany.  They were small events but the
Debian booth was crowded, as usual, so they ran out of freebees before the
end.  In Gießen, Alexander also gave a talk and a workshop covering the Debian
system.</p>

<p><strong>XFree86 to alter its License.</strong> According to an <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/pipermail/forum/2004-January/001892.html">\
announcement</a> of the XFree86 project there will be a new <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/legal/licenses.html">license</a> starting with
XFree86 v4.4.0-RC3.  There are some <a
href="http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2004/6414.html">worries</a> (German) that
these changes might be incompatible with the GPL due to a BSD-style
advertising <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd">clause</a>.
Branden Robinson indicated that he will probably not be maintaining the
system using the new license.</p>

<p><strong>Report from LinuxWorld Expo New York.</strong> Jaldhar H. Vyas
wrote a <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0121-lwe-report">report</a> about the
successful Debian presence at this year's <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0121-lwe">LinuxWorld Expo</a> in New York.  The
Debian booth attracted a lot people, usually more experienced than on past
events, and they handed out many CDs, flyers and t-shirts.  He also gave an <a
href="http://www.linuxworld.com/story/40006.htm">interview</a> on SYS-CON
radio covering the Debian project.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Extra CD Project.</strong> A few people have <a
href="http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2004/6398.html">started</a> a new <a
href="http://debian-extra-cd-proj.homelinux.org/">project</a> to provide an
additional CD for the stable Debian distribution.  They want to update the
desktop software (GNOME and KDE most likely) with <a
href="http://www.backports.org/">backported</a> packages but don't want to
force people to download large amounts of data.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Administrator's Toolbox.</strong> David B. Harris is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01862.html">soliciting</a>
package <a href="http://www.oftc.net/~dbharris/used-package-list.txt">\
lists</a> from other Debian administrators.  He's going to put together a live
CD of applications and utilities he wants to have everywhere.  He's going to
put them on 185&nbsp;MB CD media for its small size.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Call for Help.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0401/msg00015.html">\
called</a> for helping the development of the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.  The debian-boot
team still lacks manpower for several tasks such as report processing,
documentation, PCMCIA, low memory support, arm, sparc and s390 ports, policy
checks for udeb files, boot screen, support for PPP and much more.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution Chords of Music?</strong> Raphael Goulais <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00154.html">wondered</a> if
it would be ok to distribute chords but not melody since this is done in <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/mma">mma</a>.  Henning Makholm <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00152.html">added</a> that
many popular tunes work with chord sequences that are so generic and
nondescript that it would be ridiculous to claim a copyright on them.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting new GNU TLS Library.</strong> Kenshi Muto <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01985.html">wondered</a>
how he should switch CUPS from GNU TLS version 7 to version 10.  Matthias
Klose asked him to wait until the current version of CUPS has entered testing,
so that a recent version will be distributed at least.  Andreas Metzler also
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg01992.html">asked</a> to
wait until <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libgnutls10">libgnutls10</a>
has entered testing so this can't keep a new version of CUPS out of
testing.</p>

<p><strong>License Change for C-Kermit.</strong> Ian Beckwith <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0401/msg00127.html">reported</a>
about his conversation to Frank da Cruz, the author of <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/ckermit">C-Kermit</a>.  Both would like to
see Kermit move to main and are negotiating a license change.  In 2000 the
license was already altered in order to free C-Kermit more, but it is still
not compliant with the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian
Free Software Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Browsers without "mailto" Support?</strong> Andreas Tille <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02016.html">noticed</a>
that both <a href="http://packages.debian.org/galeon">Galeon</a> and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/mozilla-firebird">Firebird</a> don't know how
to handle <code>mailto</code> URLs until a GNOME mail reader is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02058.html">configured</a>,
which is not the case on a new desktop.  Felipe Almeida Lessa <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02088.html">confirmed</a>
this behaviour for Galeon, but not for Firebird.  He assumes that the support
for <code>mailto</code> URLs does not exist yet.</p>

<p><strong>Changing the Priority for GCC?</strong> Andrea Mennucc <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02102.html">complained</a>
about <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gcc">GCC</a> having priority
<code>standard</code>.  Unless the user goes into <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/dselect">dselect</a> and deselects all of
them, GCC and friends will always be installed.  When either space or
bandwidth is low, this can be quite annoying.  Hence, he proposed to move them
to priority "optional".  Nathanael Nerode <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0401/msg02210.html">explained</a>
that the issue is not that easy since a lot of packages depend on <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/cpp">CPP</a> which should therefore stay at
the old priority.</p>

<p><strong>Goals for a new Debian-Installer Release.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0401/msg02610.html">discussed</a>
goals for another release of the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
debian-installer</a> which could become beta 3.  This includes discover 2,
<code>partman</code>, using <a href="http://packages.debian.org/grub">\
grub</a>, support for XFS, Linux 2.6, improved language chooser, less
questions in <a href="http://packages.debian.org/base-config">base-config</a>,
better PCMCIA and wireless support,
sub-architecture support for PowerPC and m68k and a move to <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/subversion">subversion</a>, among
others.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-430">trr19</a> --
