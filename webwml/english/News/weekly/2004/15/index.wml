<p>Welcome to this year's 15th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Several people have discussed the presence of non-free components in the Linux
kernel last week, which has resulted in some removals already.  Robert Millan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00939.html">requested</a>
that all packages which make use of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libtool">\
libtool</a> be updated to a newer version, since this is required in order
to support the porting efforts based on GNU libc and for the kernels of <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/">GNU/kFreeBSD</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/netbsd/">GNU/kNetBSD</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Request Tracker for Debian.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0404/msg00008.html">announced</a>
an experimental <a href="http://necrotic.deadbeast.net/rt">request tracker</a>
instance for the Debian infrastructure.  It's a resource for the convenience of
people who find it useful and it's not for technical problems, like bugs in
packages.  Those belong at bugs.debian.org.  However, Joachim Breitner <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0404/msg00010.html">believed</a>
that this software is too complex for Debian and seems to target full-time
support teams, and not part-time developers.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian Project Leader elected.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00035.html">announced</a>
the results of this years' project leader <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_001">election</a>.  The winner of the election
is Martin Michlmayr.  Manoj thanked Branden Robinson and Gergely Nagy for
their service to the project, for standing for the post of project leader, and
for offering the developers a strong and viable group of candidates.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux Security Research.</strong> In response to a <a
href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=1738&amp;e=2&amp;u=/zd/20040330/tc_zd/123143">\
security survey</a>, security teams from Mandrake, Red Hat, SUSE and Debian
have released a <a href="$(HOME)/News/2004/20040406">joint statement</a>.
Despite the report's claim to incorporate a qualitative assessment of vendor
reactions to serious vulnerabilities, it treats all vulnerabilities as equal,
regardless of their risk to users.  As a result, the conclusions drawn by
Forrester have extremely limited real-world value.</p>

<p><strong>Back to GNU/Linux Basics.</strong> Michael Hall composed a <a
href="http://www.serverwatch.com/sreviews/article.php/3334021">review</a>
about Debian 3.0.  He asserted that the Debian project continues to provide a
GNU/Linux distribution that offers organizations the sort of commodity
infrastructure for which Linux was originally known.  While other GNU/Linux
variants tend to complete the installation assuming a few basic configuration
parameters, Debian's installer requires the user to make decisions about
security or functionality-related issues during the process.</p>

<p><strong>Debian powers Satellite Routers.</strong> Rodney Gedda <a
href="http://open.itworld.com/4917/040330linuxsat/page_1.html">reported</a>
about 75 towns across New South Wales (Australia) that access the Internet
through Debian-based satellite routers spanning upwards of 800,000 square
kilometers.  The local satellite router developer Ursys chose Debian because
of its packaging support, which facilitates the ability to push updates to the
routers remotely.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Package of the Day.</strong> Andrew Sweger is publishing <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/">daily descriptions</a> to
introduce people to cool packages in the Debian testing distribution such as
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/proxycheck">proxycheck</a>, <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/pwgen">pwgen</a> or <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/vtun">vtun</a>.  So far over 25 packages have
been featured.  Syndicated feeds are available in <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/data/rss">RSS</a> and <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/data/atom">Atom</a>
formats.</p>

<p><strong>Use Case: The Register.</strong> Aaron Crane of <a
href="http://www.gbdirect.co.uk/">GBdirect</a> <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/odds/about/website/">reported</a> that the
web servers of <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/">The Register</a> are
running <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/">Apache</a> on Debian GNU/Linux,
with <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> for the back-end database with
a custom content management system which is written in <a
href="http://www.perl.com/">Perl</a>.  The scripts, HTML, and CSS were created
and edited using a combination of <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>, <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU&nbsp;Emacs</a>, and <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Mozilla Firefox</a>'s <a
href="http://editcss.mozdev.org/">EditCSS</a> extension.  GBdirect chose
Debian for its stability, reliability, flexibility, and especially for its
superlative support of remote package management and upgrades.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese Book about Debian GNU/Linux.</strong> The first <a
href="http://www.drmaster.com.tw/info.asp?no=OS20101">Debian book</a> in
Chinese was recently published by a very active Debian <a
href="http://moto.debian.org.tw/">community</a> (Chinese only) in Taiwan.
The book is <a href="http://chuany.net/albums/album19/OS20101.jpg">\
entitled</a> "Debian GNU/Linux, The Painless Book" (Debian GNU/Linux
&#28961;&#30171;&#36215;&#27493;) and written by Asho Yeh
(&#33865;&#20449;&#20305;) and Moto Chen (&#38515;&#28450;&#20736;) who
also maintain the <a href="http://moto.debian.org.tw/viewtopic.php?t=2968">\
errata</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Fine-grained Dependencies.</strong> Kevin McCarty <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00067.html">announced</a>
that he's working on defining more fine-grained dependencies on libdevel
packages that currently depend upon xlibs-dev.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00141.html">added</a> that
Moritz Muehlenhoff has been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0403/msg03681.html">working</a> on this
as well.</p>

<p><strong>Namespace for GNUstep Packages.</strong> William Ballard <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00125.html">started</a> a
discussion on naming GNUstep packages, since some of them use generic names.
Evan Prodromou, however, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00134.html">disagreed</a>
and made <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00285.html">\
clear</a> that he will wait until a global naming standard for GNUstep
application packages is developed.</p>

<p><strong>Distribution of Peripheral Firmware.</strong> J.D. Hood <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00309.html">summarised</a>
the options about how Debian could handle binary-only firmware components for which
no source code is available.  Herbert Xu <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00405.html">added</a> his
view on this issue and his preference is to move all kernel packages to
non-free since this pays homage both to our commitment to Free Software as
well as our users' needs.</p>

<p><strong>PAM Release Status.</strong> Sam Hartman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00443.html">reported</a>
about problems in current PAM packages.  Upon upgrades from woody the user is
forced to answer a dpkg configuration file question for which Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00533.html">provided</a> a
solution.  Since configuration options have been aggregated, installations that
end up with an empty root password prevent root from logging in.  Steve
Langasek is discussing a change for <code>pam_unix.so</code> with upstream, to
bypass this for console access.</p>

<p><strong>Debian powers The Gathering 2004.</strong> Steinar Gunderson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00865.html">reported</a>
that all central servers in the network of <a
href="http://www.gathering.org/">The Gathering</a> 2004 in Norway are running
Debian and the load on each of these machines is usually under 0.2.  Since
they're sponsored by Sun, the central machines are Sun Netra X1 boxes
(400&nbsp;MHz SPARC-based 1U machines) that are running woody.</p>

<p><strong>General Resolution on the Social Contract.</strong> Manoj
Srivastava <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00038.html">\
called</a> for votes on the <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_003">general
resolution</a> to add editorial changes to the social contract.  Since this
modifies the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>, this
general resolution requires a 3:1 majority to pass.</p>

<p><strong>Binary Firmware Components removed.</strong> After the kernel
package maintainer has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00264.html">removed</a> the
acenic and tg3 ethernet drivers because they contain an embedded firmware
blobs, Marco d'Itri <a href="http://blog.bofh.it/id_27">investigated</a> the
Linux kernel and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/src:xfree86">XFree86</a>
packages for <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/242865">other</a> <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/242866">drivers</a> containing a firmware dump.
He added that if Debian will continue with this policy then the MGA, Rage 128
and Radeon DRM drivers will have to be removed as well.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
