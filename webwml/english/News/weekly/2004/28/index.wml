<p>Welcome to this year's 28th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The University of Zaragoza in Spain <a
href="http://www.aragob.es/pre/cido/c0407121.htm">plans</a> to distribute
50,000 copies of their <a href="http://pulsar.unizar.es/gluz/">\
distribution</a> which is based on Debian GNU/Linux and utilises the GNOME
desktop.  NewsForge took a <a
href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=04/07/09/2342211">look</a> at
the upcoming release of Linux Standard Base 2.0.</p>

<p><strong>General Resolution to force AMD64 into Sarge?</strong> Josselin
Mouette <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00019.html">\
proposed</a> a general resolution to force the pure AMD64 port into the
release of sarge and its immediate inclusion into the unstable distribution.
It's not clear to everybody on the list, though, that this is the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00067.html">right</a> way
to get this port <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00070.html">accepted</a>
into Debian nor help with the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/07/msg00024.html">release</a>
of sarge etc.</p>

<p><strong>Debian is increasing its Market Share.</strong> Netcraft is <a
href="http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/07/12/slight_linux_market_share_loss_for_red_hat.html">\
reporting</a> that Debian shows market share gains among GNU/Linux
distributions while Gentoo currently has the fastest percentage growth rate.
Debian GNU/Linux is now running on more than 1 million web-facing hostnames,
showing particular strength among French service providers Gandi (72 thousand
hostnames) and Proxad (58.8 thousand).</p>

<p><strong>Incorporating upstream CVS Fixes.</strong> Tommaso Moroni <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01074.html">wondered</a>
how he is supposed to incorporate a bugfix in the package which upstream has
corrected only in CVS.  Matthew Palmer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01076.html">explained</a>
that unless the bugfix is very large and invasive, the best way is to pick the
changes out of CVS and apply them to the Debian package.  Robert Collins <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01088.html">added</a>
that <a href="https://packages.debian.org/cscvs">cscvs</a> can help identify
changesets with CVS.</p>

<p><strong>Library Version Naming.</strong> Roland Stigge <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01092.html">reported</a>
that he is struggling with the upstream convention of incorporating the
package version into the library name (soname) and wanted to know how to
proceed.  Daniel Kobras <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01118.html">suggested</a>
to get versioning sanitized upstream and pointed to the <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html">library
packaging guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>GNUstep Policy Violation.</strong> Dan Weber <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01143.html">reported</a>
that many packages associated with GNUstep are in violation with the <a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a> since
they install binaries, documentation, etc in <code>/usr/lib/GNUstep</code>.
Sebastian Ley <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01156.html">explained</a>
that the OpenStep directory layout is not compliant with the FHS layout,
although they share similar design principles.  Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01183.html">suggested</a>
dealing with it after the release of sarge.</p>

<p><strong>GNU Compiler Collection 3.4 in unstable.</strong> Matthias Klose <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg00806.html">announced</a>
his plan to upload gcc-3.4 packages to unstable.  For some architectures the
binary interface has been changed, so compiled code must not be mixed with
compiled code from older versions of G++.</p>

<p><strong>Installing apt-listchanges as Default.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg00872.html">wondered</a>
why <a href="https://packages.debian.org/apt-listchanges">apt-listchanges</a>
is still not installed on default.  Matt Zimmerman was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg00877.html">concerned</a>
that the priorities of apt-listchanges' dependencies would have to be raised.
David Weinehall <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg01142.html">explained</a>
that only the priorities of <a href="https://packages.debian.org/ucf">ucf</a>
and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/python-apt">python-apt</a> would need
to be bumped to standard.</p>

<p><strong>New License for POSIX Manpages.</strong> Andre Lehovich <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00173.html">reported</a>
that the upstream maintainer for manpages has received permission from IEEE to
include text from the POSIX documentation in Linux manual pages and wondered
if the new license is compatible with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>
(DFSG).  Nathanael Nerode <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00182.html">believes</a>
that the license is not free enough and Andrew Suffield is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00176.html">\
undecided</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Free Software Printing Summit.</strong> Roger Leigh sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/07/msg00904.html">report</a>
from the Free Software Printing Summit that was held during this year's LSM in
Bordeaux where he was representing both Gimp-Print and Debian.  An interesting
discussion addressed multilingual PPD files.  Another discussion included
colour management for unprintable colours.</p>

<p><strong>Listmaster Bits and Bytes.</strong> Pascal Hakim sent in new <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/07/msg00013.html">\
bits</a> from the listmasters.  He explained how crossassassin and the new <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/whitelist/">white-list</a> works.  He anticipated
that the new list server which is currently in preparation will allow us to
run more stringent anti-spam checks.  He also reported about new and modified
mailing lists.</p>

<p><strong>New Package Status Summaries.</strong> Ian Lynagh <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/07/msg00011.html">\
announced</a> a new <a href="http://people.debian.org/~igloo/status.php">\
package build status</a> page and another <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~igloo/package-status.php">package status</a>
page.  The first one contains links to logs from failed build attempts and
provides a summary of package build attempts.</p>

<p><strong>Status Update for GNOME in Sarge.</strong> Jordi Mallach <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.6-sarge-2004-07-18-23-29">\
reported</a> that all critical bits of GNOME are in sarge now, but
there are still some packages like <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gnome-panel">gnome-panel</a> that still need
to transition.  All of the remaining stuff is waiting on <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gst-plugins0.8">gst-plugins0.8</a>, which
should be ready for testing but which depends on the new version of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/libxml2">libxml2</a>, that isn't being built
on hppa due to a binutils/gcc/whatever bug.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging Hardware Emulators.</strong> Dan Korostelev <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00459.html">wondered</a>
why <a href="https://packages.debian.org/visualboyadvance">\
visualboyadvance</a>, a Game Boy Advance emulator, is only in contrib in testing
since it is free itself and only depends on free libraries.  There are also
free (as in freedom) ROM files for it available on the Internet, but not in
Debian.  Branden Robinson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00275.html">cited</a>
the requirements for packages in main.  In sid, however, this package is
already in main.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with different Freenesses.</strong> Zenaan Harkness <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00022.html">\
noticed</a> that there are different definitions of free, at least "FSF-free"
and "DFSG-free".  He wondered what would it take to provide to the user the
option to choose between these definitions when it comes to packages they wish
to install.  Michael Poole <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/07/msg00023.html">\
explained</a> that there are two significant and unavoidable costs to provide this
feature: The infrastructure support for it and the policy work for it.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-528">ethereal</a> --
    Denial of service.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-529">netkit-telnet-ssl</a> --
    format string vulnerability.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-530">l2tpd</a> --
    Buffer overflow.
</ul>
