# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 25th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  We have to apologise for not being able to send out an
issue last week and only a short one today, but LinuxTag organisation kept
Joey too busy with other stuff.</p>

<p><strong>General Resolution 2004-004.</strong> The project secretary
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/06/msg00082.html">\
announced</a> the beginning of the voting period on a
<a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_004">general resolution</a>
titled "Sarge Release Schedule in view of GR 2004-003".
The full text of the ballot is quite long.  The simplified
story is that, if the resolution passes, the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>
will be modified to allow non-free data, e.g. documentation
and firmware, to be included in the next release (codename
Sarge) of Debian.  This would require a 3:1 supermajority.
Voting ends Friday 2nd July at 23:59:59 UTC.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at LinuxTag 2004.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2004/20040619">annonced</a> that it will attend the
upcoming <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0623-linuxtag">LinuxTag</a> in
Karlsruhe, Germany, which takes place from June 23rd to June 26th.  There will
be a Debian booth and a Linux porting booth in the exhibition hall and a
Skolelinux class room in the conference building.  In addition to this a
Debian mini <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2004/day.html">\
conference</a> is organised on Thursday, June 24th.  The keynote for <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a> will be delivered by Ian
Murdock.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Screenshots.</strong>  Martin Krafft <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/06/msg01392.html">announced</a>
that he has made a thorough set of <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~madduck/d-i/screenshots/">debian-installer
screenshots</a> from the netboot 20040616 and netinst 20040616 images.
Martin will be attempting to keep the screenshots up to date and would
appreciate feedback.  There is a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~madduck/d-i/screenshots/README">README</a>
file included.</p>

<p><strong>Bi-directional Language Support in Debian-Installer.</strong>
Christian Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/06/msg01453.html">announced</a>
that, thanks to the hard work of Steve Langasek (and before him Shlomi
Loubaton) support for bi-directional languages is now completely included in
debian-installer.  This appears to make Debian the first GNU/Linux distribution
to use an installer translated to right-to-left languages such as Arabic,
Hebrew and Farsi in text mode.  Screenshots and an i386-netboot.iso are <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/debian/debian-installer/">available</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ideas for Fully Automated Installations.</strong>  Christian
Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/06/msg01459.html">discussed</a>
his idea for achieving fully automated installations.  He is thinking about a
simple package that would run early in the installation process, load the floppy
module and read a file from the floppy containing simple debconf variables.
It would then feed these values to debconf and run the installer.  Jushua
Kwan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/06/msg01489.html">agreed</a>
it was a good idea, although he thought partitioning would be difficult.</p>

<p><strong>Skolelinux 1.0 released.</strong> After about three years of hard
work, <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Skolelinux</a> 1.0 is <a
href="ftp://developer.skolelinux.no/skolelinux-cd/">released</a> to the
public.  The distribution was started as a reaction to how much the Norwegian
schools and the government relied on systems using closed source.  Skolelinux
is meant to be an easy way to set up a large and secure network of LTSP thin
clients (normally PXE boot) for regular users.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-520">krb5</a> --
    Buffer overflows.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-521">sup</a> --
    Format string vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-522">super</a> --
    Format string vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-523">www-sql</a> --
    Buffer overflow.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-524">rlpr</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-525">Apache</a> --
    Buffer overflow.
</ul>

<p><strong>Debian Packages introduced last Week.</strong> Every day, a
different Debian package is <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/debaday/">featured</a> from the testing
distribution.  If you know about an obscure package you think others should
