<p>Welcome to this year's 41st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Raphaël Hertzog has written the first French <a
href="http://www.ouaza.com/livre/admin-debian/">book</a> about Debian to honour
the growing French speaking Debian community with a sample chapter online.
Joey Hess has <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/random-2004-10-13-21-29.html">\
contacted</a> submitters of older installation reports to retry and received a
lot of promising responses.  Carla Schroder <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-knopx.html?ca=dgr-lnxw03-obg-SysRecover">\
reported</a> about using <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a>
for system recovery.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GIS Sub-Project started.</strong> Francesco Lovergine <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2004/10/msg00007.html">\
announced</a> the launch of DebianGis as new Debian sub-project.  The goal is
to create a <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/index.cgi?CustomDebian">custom</a>
Debian distribution oriented to serious <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gis">Geographical Information Systems</a>
(GIS) users and applications.  Coordination currently takes place on <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/pkg-grass-general">\
Alioth</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Academic Free License.</strong>  Carlos Laviola noted
that the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/source/figlet">FIGlet</a>
developers are considering to change the license of the entire distribution
from the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">Artistic
License</a> to the <a
href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/afl-2.1.php">Academic Free License
2.1</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00230.html">wondered</a>
if it was DFSG-free.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00237.html">asserted</a>
it was clearly non-free, including a number of problematic clauses.  MJ Ray <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00240.html">observed</a>
that a clause requiring a reasonable effort to obtain the express assent of
recipients to the terms of the license might be a practical problem for
debian mirrors, regardless of the DFSG.</p>

<p> <strong>Debian in New York City.</strong>  Benjamin Mako Hill <a
href="http://mako.yukidoke.org/copyrighteous/freesoftware/20041014-00.html">\
announced</a> he has created a new email list for Debian developers in
the New York City area.  The list will be used to schedule
social get-togethers and key-signing parties.  Other cities with
similar groups are
<a href="http://wiki.debian.net/index.cgi?LocalGroups">listed</a>
in the unofficial Debian <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/">wiki</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project at Conferences.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2004/20041015">announced</a> that it will participate in
seven events in several cities in Europe.  Last weekend a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/1016-minidebconf">mini conference</a> took place in
Italy.  This week Debian is present at the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/1018-systems">systems</a> exhibition in Munich,
Germany.  Next weekend the project will participate in <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2004/1022-berlinux">Berlinux</a> in Berlin, Germany and
in <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/1022-os04">OS 04</a> in Graz, Austria.
Several Debian related talks and workshops will be held during these
events.</p>

<p><strong>Ubuntu Development Model.</strong> Michael Banck took a <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/person/mbanck/diary.html?start=24">look</a> at
how <a href="http://www.ubuntulinux.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> works.  He observed
that apparently they managed to pull off with a tiny workforce what Debian was
not able to do with a thousand volunteers and listed key development areas.
Michael pondered whether all of their work will flow back upstream, whether
they will branch off unstable again and whether the employees will find time
to work on their non-packaging related tasks for Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Generic XTerm Move?</strong> Martin Krafft is quite <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00614.html">annoyed</a>
at times by software that has <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/xterm">xterm</a> hard-coded and proposed to
move to an <em>alternatives</em>-based approach.  Peter Eisentraut however <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00617.html">reported</a>
that he has written scripts that explicitly call <code>xterm</code> because
other terminal emulator programs under X couldn't handle certain programs.
Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00620.html">suggested</a>
to file bug reports on packages that don't use <code>x-terminal-emulator\
</code> instead.</p>

<p><strong>ppp/ip-up versus network/if-up.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00693.html">discussion</a>
arose about the use of <code>ppp/ip-up</code> versus <code>network/if-up\
</code>, since both intend to run scripts whenever an interface comes up.
Marco d'Itri <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00718.html">\
suggested</a> historical reasons and reported about programs that may have
only an interest in PPP interfaces.  Thomas Hood <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00864.html">\
reported</a> that the experimental <code>ifupdown</code> facility does not
currently rerun "up" scripts if <code>pppd</code> reconnects which <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/10/msg00908.html">means</a>
that it cannot replace the PPP mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging of Driver without Firmware.</strong> Aurelien Jarno <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00089.html">wondered</a>
if a driver package could go into main if the binary-only firmware blob would
not be included.  Marco d'Itri <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00097.html">explained</a>
that if driver can be compiled and successfully executed without the firmware,
it should go in main because it's Free Software.  The hardware device may not
perform useful work until its firmware has been loaded, though, but Debian
distributes the driver and not the device.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with Trademarks.</strong> Problems with Abiword and a
discussion with their developers inspired Branden Robinson to post a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/10/msg00236.html">summary</a>
about Debian's concerns over trademark licensing.  He concluded that the
biggest question for Debian is whether the default protections that attach to
trademarks, even when unregistered and unmentioned, infringe upon the freedoms
the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a> purports to
defend.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-564">mpg123</a> --
