<p>Welcome to this year's 26th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The online-forum debianHELP is carrying an online <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/index.php?module=vquiz">Debian Trivia
Quiz</a> for you to see if you can put yourself into the hall of fame.  In
retrospect of this year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0526-debconf">Debian
conference</a> Joey Hess <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/being_productive_at_conferences-2004-06-09-18-56.html">\
complained</a> about being not very productive at conferences and high
expectations that also block productivity and socialising.</p>

<p> <strong>Quantian 0.5.9.1 released.</strong>  Dirk Eddelbuettel
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2004/06/14/#uploaded_0.5.9.1">announced</a>
a new release of Quantian, a re-mastered version of <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> for use by applied or
theoretical workers in quantitative or data-driven fields.
This version is intended for
DVDs and no longer fits on a CD-ROM.  Users without a DVD
can use their hard disk to
<a href="http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2004/06/16#howto_winboot">boot</a>
the ISO image.</p>

<p> <strong>GNOME 2.6 moves into testing.</strong> The
latest version of GNOME has started to propagate into
Testing (Sarge), less than a month after the release
managers
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/05/msg00126.html">gave</a>
permission for GNOME 2.6 to migrate from experimental to
unstable.  Jordi Mallach <a
href="http://oskuro.net/~jordi/blog/freesoftware/gnome-mayhem-2004-06-18-00-33.html">provided</a>
temporary workarounds for several packaging bugs.</p>

<p> <strong>Future of Debian X11 Packages.</strong>
Fabio Massimo Di Nitto, the current Debian X11 release manager,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg00979.html">inquired</a>
about which direction these packages should go.  Because of
a licensing change Debian can no longer use
<a href="http://www.xfree86.org">XFree86</a> as upstream.
Keith Packard
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01006.html">suggested</a>
moving away from a monolithic source package and switching to
<a href="http://www.x.org">X.org</a> as the new upstream.  Daniel Stone
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01051.html">described</a>
several of the options.
</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Public License 1.1.</strong> MJ Ray <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/06/msg00514.html">\
posted</a> an update about the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">\
Mozilla license 1.1</a>, claiming that
there is no consensus about all MPL-covered works
and they should be checked individually, as before.
The discussion continues and more information are sought,
in particular about the US venue choice.</p>

<p><strong>Preparing for Debian-Installer TC2.</strong>  Joey Hess posted an
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/06/msg02369.html">update</a>
on the important and unresolved issues remaining in <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> testing.
He has tried to track release critical issues, and get the fixes into
testing.  His plan is to wait for the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/libdebian-installer">libdebian-installer</a>
and busybox fixes
to reach testing and then do another official debian-installer images build
on the autobuilders.  That build will then be blessed as Test Candidate 2,
and there will be another round of testing to see if it is finally in a
releasable state.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD live CD.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2004/06/msg00014.html">created</a> a
GNU/kFreeBSD <a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/livecd/">live CD</a>. A
new installation guide is also <a
href="http://svn.debian.org/viewcvs/glibc-bsd/trunk/web/kfreebsd/INSTALL?view=auto&amp;rev=65">\
available</a>.  This ISO image contains a basic rescue system with
GNU/kFreeBSD.  It is usable for simple tasks and for just testing, but doesn't
setup writable filesystems for you or has development tools installed.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Women List operational.</strong>  Pascal Hakim <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2004/06/msg00000.html">announced</a>
that the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/">debian-women</a> list
has now been created.  It is an un-moderated mailing list for Debian users
and developers who wish to involve more women in the Debian project.  It is
for discussion and sharing of ideas as well as project collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>Dropping Freeswan for Openswan.</strong> Rene Mayrhofer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01460.html">discussed</a>
his current difficulties with freeswan.  He noted that the list of bugs on
the freeswan packages is too long and although it is improved over a year ago
he is unable to fix all possible combinations of freeswan and kernels.
Rene's preferred option for dealing with the situation is to remove freeswan
in favour of openswan.</p>

<p><strong>Removal of outdated Translations.</strong>  Javier
Fern&aacute;ndez-Sanguino Pe&ntilde;a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2004/07/msg00015.html">discovered</a>
that translations are removed from the website after six months of not being
updated.  He thought that since some version changes in the English wml files
are merely cosmetic, the translations may not need updating.  He asked that
only translations that are way too outdated be removed (more than 5 versions
behind).  Peter Karlsson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2004/07/msg00019.html">did not
agree</a> there was a problem.  He thought six months without any reaction
from the translation team qualified as way too outdated.</p>

<p><strong>Fingerprint of the Archive Signing Key.</strong>  Martin F. Krafft
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01499.html">noted</a>
that as APT 0.6 will check for package signatures, the archive signing key
will become more relevant to Debian users.  However, he could not find a
place on the web page from which the key is linked, nor information on how to
get it or how to verify it.  He proposed having a web page explaining the key and
its trust basis, and also publishing the key's fingerprint.
As Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/06/msg01525.html">pointed
out</a> the key is indeed <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/">linked</a>
from the web pages, though not very visible.</p>

<p><strong>State of Sarge Debian-Installer: Broken.</strong>  Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/07/msg00053.html">looked</a>
at sarge's debian-installer and concluded that it is broken.  He sees many
instances of changes that break dependencies.  He thought it's likely that
sid's d-i now has less bugs than sarge's and that sid is diverging too far
from sarge for it to be easy to keep maintaining sarge.  He may throw away
the plan of incremental copying of binary packages into sarge, and revert to taking a
snapshot, hoping that it mostly works and copying everything to sarge in one
go for a release.</p>

<p><strong>Debian used in German Agencies.</strong> The German <a
href="http://www.bsi.bund.de/">agency for security in the information
technology</a> (BSI) <a href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/48828">\
released</a> (German only) the so called "agency-desktop" ERPOSS which was developed in
collaboration with <a href="http://www.credativ.de/">credativ GmbH</a> and uses
Debian GNU/Linux, KDE 3.2, a preconfigured and activated personal firewall and
among other software the mail client KMail with integrated virus and spam
protection.  BSI offers a <a
href="http://www.bsi.bund.de/produkte/erposs3/ERPOSS3_LIVECD.ISO">live CD</a>
and an <a
href="http://www.bsi.bund.de/produkte/erposs3/ERPOSS3_INSTALLATION.ISO">\
installation CD</a>.</p>
