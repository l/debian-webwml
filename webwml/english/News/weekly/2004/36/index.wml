<p>Welcome to this year's 36th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Graham Williams has written a <a
href="http://www.togaware.com/linux/survivor/">book</a> entitled Debian
GNU/Linux Desktop Survival Guide which is intended to deliver a fun and
productive environment.  It guides you through the many different regions of a
GNU/Linux system with a focus on getting your desktop environment to do what
you want it to do.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation of Sarge CD and DVD Images.</strong> Steve McIntyre <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/2004/09/msg00042.html">explained</a>
how dual layer DVD discs work and mentioned the types of CD and DVD he would
like to see supported for the upcoming sarge release.  This includes business
card and network installation ISO images as well as full 13 or 15 CD image
sets for each architecture.  He also mentioned two 4.7&nbsp;GB size DVD images
and one 8.5&nbsp;GB size double layer DVD image for each architecture.  The
latter should only be provided via <a href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>,
though.</p>

<p><strong>Using Debian in commercial Environments.</strong> Somebody <a
href="http://ask.slashdot.org/askslashdot/04/09/07/2219255.shtml">asked</a> on
Slashdot about experience shoe-horning Debian into a commercial scenario when
the third-party vendor (IBM) doesn't officially support this distribution.  He
also mentioned about anecdotal evidence that most of such software can be
persuaded to work on Debian as well.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.6 Transition complete.</strong> Jordi Mallach <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.6-sarge-2004-09-08-01-39">\
reported</a> that the transition of GNOME 2.6 into sarge is finished.  The
last missing package from the GNOME meta package, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/eog">Eye of
GNOME</a> has finally entered testing.  The only missing package is <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/gdm">gdm</a> 2.6 which will allow GNOME users
to shutdown the computer directly when they close their session.</p>

<p><strong>Debian.net Web Forums in Beta.</strong> Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/09/msg00014.html">announced</a>
that since many people like web-based forums for discussion and support, he would
try providing a web forum for the Debian community.  The <a
href="http://forums.debian.net">web forums</a> are still in beta, so any
suggestions for improvements or problem reports should be sent to
<a href="mailto:admin@forums.debian.net">admin@forums.debian.net</a>.  Of
course, like all *.debian.net sites, the forums
are not an official Debian service, and it's been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2004/09/msg00024.html">merged</a>
with
<a href="http://forums.debian.net/">Debianplaza</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Partman needs testing.</strong>  Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2004/09/msg00408.html">pointed
out</a> that recent changes to <code>partman</code> have introduced a lot of
bugs, including problems with reiserfs and xfs. He doesn't know at this point
if the new partman is suitable to be in the next <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> release.
To help fix the problem, he has called for volunteers to test partman in the
daily builds to not only do automated partitioning tests, but manual
partitioning to try all the strange combinations that are not often used and
make sure it works at least as well as it did in rc1.</p>

<p><strong>New legal Counsel for SPI.</strong>  The Board of Directors of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a> (SPI),
Debian's umbrella organisation, <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2004/000100.html">announced</a>
the appointment of new legal counsel after the former one, Chris Rourk, had
resigned.  The firm of <a
href="http://www.cgsh.com/">Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &amp; Hamilton</a>,
represented by Greg Pomerantz, was willing to serve as SPI's pro bono legal
counsel and was duly appointed as such by the board.</p>

<p><strong>UserLinux releases first beta CD.</strong>  Slashdot
<a href="http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/09/10/1544203">discussed</a>
the <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS2694988953.html">beta release</a>
of <a href="http://www.userlinux.com/">UserLinux</a>,
a new Debian-based distribution.  Bruce Perens explained
that UserLinux is closely based on Debian and aims to provide businesses
with freely available, high quality GNU/Linux operating systems accompanied by
certifications, service, and support options.  Their i386 install CD is only
4.5&nbsp;MB large, with the remainder downloaded directly from Debian mirrors
and they want to do all of their Free Software development within Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Testing Debian-Installer Improvements.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/my_debian-installer_test_methods-2004-09-12-00-24.html">\
reported</a> about the techniques he uses for <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">installer</a> tests.  The first and
preferred method includes creating a new netboot image to boot a test-laptop.
The second method refers to writing it on a USB stick to boot from.  He also <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/one_keystroke_to_debian-2004-09-10-19-58.html">\
reported</a> that he managed to pre-seed the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> so that the first
stage installer runs with only one single keystroke.</p>

<p><strong>Using Auto* Tools for Building Packages?</strong> Jesus
Gonzalez-Barahona <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00495.html">\
wondered</a> if he should run <a href="http://packages.debian.org/automake">\
automake</a> at build-time instead of just using <code>configure</code>
provided by upstream.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00500.html">asserted</a>
that this would render the package unbuildable once automake changes.  Marcelo
Magallon <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2004/09/msg00504.html">added</a>
that automake versions are not compatible at source level and asked to keep
the amount of included cruft as small as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Patent Lawsuit Prohibition.</strong> Matthew Garrett had a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~terpstra/message/20040914.112541.76c4237d.en.html">\
look</a> at licenses that are designed to discourage patent lawsuits.  He
noted that both <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> and
the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a> appear to
consider those licenses free, but the compatibility with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>
seems to be unclear.  If Debian decides to consider these (or some) licenses
non-free, the project needs to make it clear precisely why it holds this
opinion, and then set about trying to change other people's minds.</p>

<p><strong>System Binaries linked against unreachable Libraries.</strong>
Fabrice Lorrain <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/09/msg00033.html">noticed</a>
that several programs in <code>/sbin</code> are linked against libraries
located in <code>/usr/lib</code>.  These programs won't work unless
<code>/usr</code> is mounted.  Hence they should either be moved into
<code>/usr/sbin</code> or the libraries need to be moved into
<code>/lib</code> instead.  Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2004/09/msg00035.html">explained</a>
that <a href="http://packages.debian.org/lintian">lintian</a> cannot warn
about this currently.</p>

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
