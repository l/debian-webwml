<p>Welcome to this year's 14th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Manoj Srivastava sent out the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0404/msg00010.html">final call</a>
for votes on the project leader <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2004/vote_001">\
election</a> and revealed that 351 of the 908 developers have already voted.
Andreas Schuldei is still <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02324.html">looking</a> for
ideas for talks for the upcoming <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0526-debconf">\
Debian Conference</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Support for Hotplug in Debian.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/hotplug-2004-04-01-01-46.html">\
noticed</a> that support for hotplugged devices is an area where Debian could
lead and excel in integration, but the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/libgphoto2-2">libgphoto2-2</a> package states
that the provided scripts are not meant to be used by default.  He
complained that there seems to be little desire to work on these scripts and
instead wait for other distributions to do fairly useful things by default when USB
devices are plugged in.</p>

<p><strong>Snapshot Archive is now searchable for Packages.</strong> Fumitoshi
Ukai (&#40284;&#39164; &#25991;&#25935;)
 <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02235.html">\
announced</a> that he has implemented a new function on <a
href="http://snapshot.debian.net/">snapshot.debian.net</a> to search for
packages.  This is sure to help many people in searching for old versions of a
particular package from the huge archive.  He has also created a shortcut URL
of the form <code>http://snapshot.debian.net/package/&lt;packagename&gt;</code>.
Domenico Andreoli and Branden Robinson thanked him for this great job as well
as Martin Schulze who suggested he implement such this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Host Naming Scheme.</strong> After Lars Wirzenius <a
href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2004-03.html#20040329c">wondered</a> if no-one
else cares about choosing names for computers with care, comments and
revelations by <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/wouterverhelst/17642.html">Wouter
Verhelst</a>, <a href="http://triplehelix.org/~joshk/blog/linux/14.html">\
Joshua Kwan</a>, <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/keybuk/10164.html">Scott James
Remnant</a>, <a
href="http://raw.no/personal/blog/tech/2004-03-31-02-39_naming.html">Tollef
Fog Heen</a> and <a href="http://beta.pumuki.org/?q=node/view/28">Jesus
Climent</a>, a Debian admin <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200403311146">explained</a> the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/misc/naming.html">naming</a> scheme used
for debian.org hosts.  Most of them are named after ancient baroque or
classical composers, with a number of exceptions.</p>

<p><strong>RPM orphaned and not free anymore?</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/239518">orphaned</a> <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/rpm">rpm</a> since the newest version depends
on the non-free elfutils library.  This makes it impossible for Joey to update
the package.  Not being able to include <code>rpm</code> in Debian could have
far reaching consequences - from problems with the LSB to increased difficulty
to run other distributions software on Debian and vice-versa.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Security Advisories CVE-compatible.</strong> The Debian
project <a href="$(HOME)/News/2004/20040330">announced</a> that <a
href="$(HOME)/security/">Debian Security Advisories</a> have been declared <a
href="$(HOME)/security/cve-compatibility">CVE-compatible</a> at the RSA
Conference 2004, in San Francisco, February 24th, 2004.  The project also
believes that it is extremely important to provide users with additional
information related to security issues that affect the Debian
distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Debian Distributions.</strong> Andreas Tille <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0404/msg00002.html">\
announced</a> a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/paper-cdd/debian-cdd.html/">\
paper</a> he wrote about <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/cdd/">\
custom Debian distributions</a>, the techniques used and the goals behind
them.  This is an implicit call for participation for all those people inside
and outside the Debian project.  Custom Debian distributions try to provide a
solution for special groups of target users with different skills and
interests.</p>

<p><strong>Getting newer Kernels in stable.</strong> Andrew Pollock <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02166.html">wanted</a> to
know if it would be possible to get newer kernel packages in stable Debian
releases, since he is concerned about Debian installation issues.  The stable
release manager <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0404/msg00486.html">explained</a>
that new versions are not possible since too much can break.  Instead he
encouraged people to maintain additional repositories with updated kernel
packages.</p>

<p><strong>April Fools Pranks.</strong> The community released a couple of
April fools pranks, of which we're listing some.  Pascal Hakim sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0403/msg02440.html">document</a>
covering improvements for Debian releases.  Pablo Lorenzzoni became <a
href="http://hackers.propus.com.br/~pablo/blog/?id=19">illuminated</a> and
wanted to switch to a proprietary operating system.  The Internet Society
determined the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3751.html">\
requirements</a> for the Omniscience Protocol (RFC&nbsp;3751).  Symlink <a
href="http://www.symlink.ch/articles/04/03/31/2154255.shtml">reported</a> (German only)
about a guy who wanted to file a class-action law against the Free Software
Foundation.  Finally, the <a
href="http://www.cs.uni-frankfurt.de/~schmehl/grsecurity-first-april.png">defacement</a>
of their own website by the grsecurity devlopers was a bit awkward and scared
quite some people.</p>

<p><strong>Additional Links to Translations.</strong> Nobuhiro Imai (&#20170;&#20117; &#20280;&#24195;)
 <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0403/msg00189.html">wondered</a> if
he was permitted to add additional links to translations of Debian web pages.
In these cases the original page links to an external resource and its
Japanese translation is located somewhere else.  Gerfried Fuchs <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0403/msg00191.html">explained</a>
that this would be appreciated and helpful, and he already have added such
links to German translations.  He also noted that one should not have to
change anything if the other website has enabled <a
href="$(HOME)/intro/cn">content negotiation</a> as well.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed L10n Framework.</strong> Jure Cuhalev <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0403/msg00076.html">proposed</a> a
new scheme for Debian localisation work (l10n), where all translation teams
would use an Alioth project that would serve as a common gateway.  The
advantage of such a system is that it is less work for maintainers and
translators to update their translations, as it is now for the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> already.  However,
Denis Barbier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0403/msg00095.html">explained</a>
that this should be handled with care, since packages have to be synchronised
and the maintainer could have used different translations.</p>

<p><strong>Bugtracking System moved.</strong> The bug tracking system was moved
from master to spohr but master kept a regularly updated copy.
This has been moved to merkel, due to disk space issues on master.  Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0403/msg00029.html">\
asked</a> other developers to move their related scripts to merkel.
The mirror is updated every fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Zope Maintenance in Debian.</strong> There has been a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00001.html">discussion</a> (German only)
about removing Zope from testing.  Jonas Meurer instead <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00027.html">encouraged</a>
other developers to start forming a maintenance group since it may require
more maintainer activity than most other packages.  David Coe <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-0404/msg00028.html">added</a>
that the current maintainers were always willing to accept good patches and
non-maintainer uploads.</p>

# Note wo webmaster: The link to http://www.linuxnewmedia.de/presse will have
# to be removed later as the news has no permanent link and will be dropped
# out of the page in some months.

<p><strong>Indirect Donation from Redmond.</strong> A particular advertisement
in the current issue of the German <a
href="http://www.linux-magazin.de/">Linux Magazin</a> magazine, created and
paid by a Redmond-based company, did not only cause a <a
href="http://www.linux-community.de/Neues/story?storyid=12819">discussion</a>
on whether a GNU/Linux oriented magazine should accept such an advertisement
but also a large <a href="http://www.linuxnewmedia.de/presse">donation</a> to
the Debian project.</p>

<p><strong>Probing for Operating Systems.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/os_probing-2004-04-04-04-40.html">\
reported</a> that he was working together with Joshua Kwan to work on probing
for other operating systems.  This will be used by the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> to create the boot
configuration which should be able to boot other operating systems as
well.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-470">Linux 2.4.17</a> (hppa) --
