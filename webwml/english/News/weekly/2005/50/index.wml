<p>Welcome to this year's 50th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Wouter Verhelst <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2005/12/msg00000.html">called</a>
for talks for the developer's room at the upcoming <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2006/0225-fosdem">FOSDEM</a> conference.  Nathanael
Nerode <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/12/msg00074.html">\
reported</a> that the C++ transitions are processing well and that he doesn't
expect new problems with it.</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Branden Robinson.</strong> TuxJournal delivered an
<a href="http://www.tuxjournal.net/intervista6.html">interview</a> with
Branden that talks a bit about his background and the advantages of the Debian
distribution.  His primary focus as Debian Project Leader has been to try to
resolve some long-standing infrastructural issues that have been frustrating
our developers and users.</p>

<p><strong>Joining Skolelinux Forces.</strong> Steffen Joeris <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2005/12/msg00166.html">proposed</a>
using <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">www.skolelinux.org</a> as a
debian-edu community base featuring a <a
href="http://planetplanet.org/">Planet</a> RSS feed aggregator as well
as email addresses and web space for project members. This should not
only strengthen the debian-edu community but also facilitate
coordination and cooperation between the different local teams.</p>

<p><strong>Debian stabilising the Linux Landscape.</strong> Tom Adelstein <a
href="http://lxer.com/module/newswire/view/49490/index.html">explained</a> how
he switched from several other distributions to Debian GNU/Linux and why it
serves him best.  The Debian project tends to attract members with a higher level
of technical expertise and a strong commitment to the Free Software
Foundation.  According to <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/">Netcraft</a>,
Debian is currently the fastest growing GNU/Linux distribution for web
servers, with more than 1.2 million active sites in December.</p>

<p><strong>DCC Common Core 3.0 released.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.dccalliance.org/">DCC Alliance</a> announced the <a
href="http://www.dccalliance.org/pressrelease2.html">release</a> of DCC 3.0.
This is an <a href="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/lsb.shtml">LSB</a> 3.0
compliant base set of packages based on and compatible with Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/">sarge</a>.  DCC 3.0 contains 237 packages of
which 200 are binary packages taken from Debian sarge and 32 are a backports
from <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a>.  The remaining 5 packages
provide LSB 3.0 compliance in such a way that the default application
environment is 100&nbsp;% <a
href="http://www.dccalliance.org/releasenotes.html">compatible</a> with  
standard Debian sarge.</p>

<p><strong>New Features on buildd.net.</strong> Ingo J&uuml;rgensmann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01102.html">announced</a>
the inclusion of <a href="http://www.debonaras.org/">armeb</a>, <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/">hurd-i386</a>, <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/">kfreebsd-i386</a> and <a
href="http://www.linux-m32r.org/">m32r</a> on <a
href="http://www.buildd.net/">buildd.net</a>.  Other features include
estimations of package building times on various architectures, more statistics,
links to package information and bugs, and an <a
href="http://www.buildd.net/cgi/nowbuilding.cgi">overview</a> about currently
built packages for those <a href="$(HOME)/devel/buildd/">buildd</a> that
support this site.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing different Upstream Packages.</strong> Jay Berkenbilt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01140.html">pondered</a>
the inclusion of third party programs from different upstream developers in a
Debian package and was soliciting input.  Mark Brown <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01143.html">replied</a>
with details about the procedure with NIS packages.  Nathanael Nerode <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01156.html">added</a>
that the inclusion depends on the size of the new program and its prospective
use.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting Packages.</strong> Bill Allombert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01170.html">asked</a>
developers who split their packages into a normal and a data package to obey
to a number of rules that will help Debian keep the archive sober.  These
include a naming scheme, keeping program data in the normal package, the use
of symbolic links and actually moving the shared data into the data
package.</p>

<p><strong>Configuration Handling.</strong> Frank K&uuml;ster <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01239.html">wondered</a>
how to treat the large number of potential configuration files of the TeX
system best in Debian packages.  He proposed to use a new directory for
local files that should be preferred.  Bill Allombert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01254.html">replied</a>
with details on how the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/menu">menu</a>
package handles its configuration.</p>

<p><strong>GPLv3 Development Process.</strong> Francesco Poli <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00005.html">reported</a>
that the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> has
recently disclosed details about the drafting <a
href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/process-definition">process</a> that will be
adopted for the upcoming version 3 of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.  The final text is
scheduled to be released between September 2006 and March 2007 with at least
two draft versions to be released in January and June 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Task Descriptions.</strong> Andreas Schuldei <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/11/msg00132.html">called</a>
for volunteers to document descriptions of various <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/JobDescription">tasks</a> within the Debian
project.  The goal of these descriptions is to separate names and persons from
tasks that should lead to more objective discussion in the future.</p>

<p><strong>GameBoy Emulators.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00024.html">wondered</a>
whether GameBoy emulators that are released under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> should be placed in
<code>main</code> or <code>contrib</code> since they require potentially
non-free games.  However, <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gngb">gngb</a>
is in <code>main</code> while <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gnuboy">\
gnuboy</a> is in <code>contrib</code>.  Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/12/msg00029.html">added</a>
that there is a thriving community of developers of free gameboy <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/opengbgames">games</a>.</p>
