<p>Welcome to this year's 26th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Rafael Laboissiere <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00588.html">wondered</a>
if bug reports for woody can now be closed, but Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00600.html">added</a>
that they should be kept if they are security related and that others may be
useful to prevent others from reporting them again.  Martin F. Krafft <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/06/msg03748.html">announced</a>
his new <a href="http://debiansystem.info/">book</a> that was introduced at <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Package Policy Committee.</strong> Branden Robinson officially <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00017.html">\
founded</a> the package policy committee that has the authority to handle the
<a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/">Debian policy manual</a>.  He appointed
Manoj Srivastava (chair), Andreas Barth and Matt Zimmerman to maintain the
document and define levels of conformance other standards.</p>

<p><strong>Release Policy for Etch.</strong> Andreas Barth <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00019.html">\
announced</a> changes in the <a
href="http://release.debian.org/etch_rc_policy.txt">release policy</a> for the
etch release.  It is now required that all content in main and contrib is <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>-free.  It is also not
permitted that the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00654.html">changelog</a>
or build dependencies are altered during the build process.</p>

<p><strong>XML Application Files.</strong> Christian Heller <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00741.html">wondered</a>
where to place programs that are written in the XML-based language CYBOL and
interpreted by CYBOI.  Marc Brockschmidt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00761.html">asserted</a>
that this program and interpreter situation looks like Perl and hence should
be handled in a similar way.</p>

<p><strong>Conflicting Program Names.</strong> Sebastian Kuzminsky <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00909.html">noticed</a>
that two packages provide a <code>git</code> binary.  To avoid this file
conflict the packages did conflict with each other, but this is seriously <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00918.html">wrong</a>.
Steve Greenland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01114.html">asserted</a>
that renaming the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/cogito">cogito</a>
binary would make Debian incompatible with other distributions and kernel
development.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture-specific Packages.</strong> Russ Allbery <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00929.html">maintains</a>
the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/openafs-client">\
OpenAFS</a> which is not supported on four architectures.  Goswin Brederlow <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00995.html">explained</a>
three mechanisms that are used by the build daemons to avoid packages they
shouldn't try to build.  <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/srcdep/Packages-arch-specific?rev=HEAD&amp;cvsroot=dak&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">\
Packages-arch-specific</a> is the proper resource for this type of
packages.</p>

<p><strong>TeXlive versus teTeX.</strong> Norbert Preining <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00970.html">announced</a>
to package TeXlive, one of the most complete TeX systems.  The advantage of
TeXlive is a more fine-grained package structure, while teTeX would still be
around and could make use of TeXlive modules.  Frank K&uuml;ster <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg01131.html">explained</a>
that both packages are well maintained but use a different style.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Presentations in Peru.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.debianperu.org/">DebianPeru</a> user group started a series
of <a href="http://www.debianperu.org/files/debian-sarge.sxi">\
presentations</a> across the country to spread the word of Free Software and
the new release of Debian, give an introduction into our philosophy and have
fun.  They will hand out CDs to attendees and send CD sets to the main cities
as well.</p>
