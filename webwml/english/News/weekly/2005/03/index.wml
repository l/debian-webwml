<p>Welcome to this year's 3rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Roger So sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00008.html">\
reminder</a> for the Call for Papers for the Asia Debian Mini-Conf taking
place at the end of February in Beijing, China.  Jeroen van Wolffelaar compiled
a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/01/msg00040.html">\
list</a> of packages in contrib which should be forced into the testing stage
of contrib.  Ankit Malik listed <a
href="http://software.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/06/1557225">ten
ways</a> to pay back to the Free Software community.</p>

<p><strong>Final DebConf 4 Report.</strong> Pablo Lorenzzoni <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00007.html">\
announced</a> the <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf4/final-report.html">final report</a>
about the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2004/0526-debconf">Debian Conference</a>
held last year in Porto Alegre.  The report is more a spreadsheet and lists 163
people who have attended this conference representing many teams inside the
Debian project.  Several sponsors have made this event possible and the
organisers even document things that can be improved next time.</p>

<p><strong>Development on dpkg.</strong> Scott James Remnant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00006.html">\
announced</a> the experimental branch of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/dpkg">dpkg</a>.  This branch is intended to
see fairly rapid releases incorporating both bug fixes and new
development/features.  It may be slightly more unstable than you may be used
to.  Development plans are documented in the <a href="http://www.dpkg.org/">\
dpkg wiki</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Policy for Debian Consultants.</strong> Tobias Toedter <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/01/msg00236.html">proposed</a>
a new policy regarding the addition of entries to the Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/consultants/">consultants list</a>.  The consultants team didn't
reach consensus on which part of the address is mandatory.  Additionally, a
discussion came up why Debian is now requiring the consultant to link to the
Debian website as well.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Papers for Mini-DebConf.</strong> Jonathan Oxer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00003.html">\
called</a> for speakers for the upcoming Debian Miniconf taking place before
the <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/">Linux Conference Australia</a>.
Presentation topics have to be directly related to Debian and be intended for
a technical audience.  Presentation slots are 1 hour long with 45 minutes for
presentation, 10 minutes for questions and 5 minutes for speaker changeover.  The
format is pretty casual and relaxed though so anything can happen on the
day.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping old Library Versions intact.</strong> Thomas Bushnell <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00623.html">wondered</a>
how to keep an older library intact but also providing a newer version.
Santiago Vila <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00631.html">proposed</a>
to upload the old version with a higher version number than the current and
the new version with a new binary name and an adjusted library soname.  When
both libraries are compatible, the old <code>-dev</code> package is not
required anymore and the library should go into section oldlibs.</p>

<p><strong>Different Architectures Binary Packages.</strong> Norbert Preining
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00697.html">\
wondered</a> if there is support for placing binaries of different
architectures and operating systems in the same Debian package.  Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00703.html">explained</a>
that the proposed location of architecture specific files would even be a
violation of the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a> (FHS).</p>

<p><strong>Disabling Daemon Services.</strong> Erik Schanze <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00761.html">wondered</a>
how to disable the start of daemons so that this setting will be kept upon
upgrades.  Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00774.html">referred</a>
to the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch3#s3.6">\
Securing Debian Manual</a> where it is explained that you need to leave one
link intact.</p>

<p><strong>Editing History?</strong> Frank Küster <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00790.html">wondered</a>
if it would be acceptable to add information about closed bugs to older
changelog entries.  Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00791.html">considered</a>
it fine to correct and improve older items.  He <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00800.html">added</a>
that Branden Robinson improves the changelog file in order to be able to
correctly lookup when a certain bug was fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Essential Packages for Building Packages.</strong> Scott James
Remnant <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00849.html">\
wondered</a> if <a href="https://packages.debian.org/debhelper">debhelper</a>
is or rather should be declared build-essential since 92&nbsp;% of all source
packages declare a build-dependency on it.  This could remove a large chunk of
versioned dependencies on one hand, but on the other hand new versioned <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg00927.html">\
dependencies</a> against <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/build-essential">build-essential</a> would be
introduced when newer versions of <code>debhelper</code> are required for
building.</p>

<p><strong>Turck-MMCache undistributable?</strong> Elizabeth Fong <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00130.html">sought</a>
advice since Andres Salomon <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/280864">\
reported</a> Turck-MMCache as undistributable.  The software has been
abandoned upstream with an unresponsive developer, but forked.  However, its
license (GPL) is not compatible with the license of PHP4 which it needs to be
linked against.  In combination this means that Debian cannot distribute
binary packages of Turck-MMCache.</p>

<p><strong>License of graphviz.</strong> Somebody <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00297.html">wondered</a>
why <a href="https://packages.debian.org/graphviz">graphviz</a> was in non-free
when the <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/License.php">license</a> on its
homepage was considered free by the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">debian-legal</a>.  Marco
d'Itri <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00299.html">\
pointed out</a> that the software has recently been relicensed.  Andrew
Suffield <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00394.html">added</a>
that the new upstream version may go into main.</p>

<p><strong>Debian From Scratch.</strong> Bruce Byfield wrote an <a
href="http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/01/10/1727246">introduction</a>
to <a href="https://people.debian.org/~jgoerzen/dfs/html/dfs.html">Debian from
scratch</a> (DFS).  It comprises of a bootable CD and the programs to generate
it.  By default only core packages are installed.  DFS supports most major
file systems, RAID, and LVM2, and includes several partition editors which
make it a useful rescue CD.</p>

<p><strong>Properly Crafting the debian/copyright File.</strong> Jochen Voss
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00488.html">\
wondered</a> how to properly write the <code>debian/copyright</code> file.
Henning Makholm <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00519.html">explained</a>
that all authors who claim copyright in a source file should be credited in
the Debian copyright file, together with the exact statement of license they
issued.  He added some compression practices to improve the readability of
that file.</p>
