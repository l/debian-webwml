<p>Welcome to this year's 8th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Manoj Srivastava <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/02/msg00006.html">\
announced</a> that only one week is left for nominations for the upcoming
project leader <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2005/vote_001">elections</a>.  In order
to achieve international standards recognition, the <a
href="http://www.linuxbase.org/">LSB</a> has been <a
href="http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/05/01/16/0232222.shtml">submitted</a> to
the ISO/IEEE.</p>

<p><strong>Debconf Template Translation.</strong> Christian Perrier <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2005/02/msg00038.html">gave</a> an
update on the status of debconf translations in Debian. Most debconf
templates are now handled through <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/po-debconf">po-debconf</a>, which makes it
much easier to handle translations. There are only 102 packages left which are
not using this utility.  He plans to start uploading non-maintainer versions of
these with translation support enabled.  Lucas Wall <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~lwall/i18n/">provided</a> a status page for
those packages.</p>

<p><strong>Moria Author found.</strong> Robert Koeneke, the original author of
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/moria">Moria</a> (a rogue-like game) <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00806.html">contacted</a>
debian-devel and was amazed to see people were still playing the game he had
started developing 20 years ago. He is now looking into re-licensing it under
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>, which would
help move Moria, Angband and derivatives into the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>Roles and Responsibilities of the FTPmaster Team.</strong>
Matthew Garrett wrote an <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/02/msg00184.html">explanation</a>
of what the ftpmasters do, the first in a series of articles about the
various teams in Debian.  They manage the master archive,
add and remove packages from it, and work with the release
managers to ensure that files in the archive are in the correct place.  The
ftpmaster team wrote and maintain the scripts used to automate much of
this.  They only worry about the master archive, the mirror
network is handled by the mirror team.</p>

<p><strong>Broken Dependencies in Unstable.</strong> Dan Jacobson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00659.html">wondered</a>
about the broken dependencies he notices every now and then.  Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00666.html">answered</a>
that this is the problem that the testing distribution is intended to solve.
Goswin Brederlow <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00696.html">explained</a>
that this is caused by strictly versioned dependencies to
<code>binary-all</code> packages.</p>

<p><strong>Archive Verification for Sarge?</strong> Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/02/msg00097.html">mentioned</a>
that there is a chance to get <a href="https://packages.debian.org/apt">apt</a>
updated in sarge.  Therefore a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00646.html">call for
help</a> was sent to developers who are interested in having automatic archive
verification in the upcoming release.  To achieve this Florian Weimer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00969.html">created</a>
a detailed <a href="http://www.enyo.de/fw/software/apt-secure/">status</a>
report.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Dependency Calculation.</strong> Joel Aelwyn <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00855.html">proposed</a>
to implement <code>dh_devincludes</code> that would calculate the proper
development library dependencies of a given package during the build stage.
He wondered if this needs special treatment for versioned dependencies and
whether other languages than C should be supported.</p>

<p><strong>Dropping Architectures?</strong> In response to build failures on
some architectures due to missing disk space it was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00907.html">quickly</a>
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00992.html">\
suggested</a> to drop some architectures from the release.  Goswin Brederlow
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00994.html">\
asserted</a> that several bugs have been found while porting which improves
the software and Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00995.html">explained</a>
this in detail and asked where exactly Debian wasted time.</p>

<p><strong>New mplayer for Debian.</strong> Andrea Mennucc <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00175.html">\
announced</a> that has uploaded new <code>mplayer</code> <a
href="http://tonelli.sns.it/pub/mplayer/sarge">packages</a> that should comply
with Debian's needs.  Upstream developers have resolved the remaining license
issues over the last months.  The support for DeCSS has also been removed from
the Debian package because of legal problems.</p>

<p><strong>Potential License Problem with PHP.</strong> Martin 'Joey' Schulze
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00222.html">\
quoted</a> parts of the PHP licenses and wondered if Debian was allowed to
name their packages as upstream did. MJ Ray <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00223.html">pointed
out</a> that the relevant phrase has been strengthened for PHP4 and asserted
that it doesn't forbid Debian to continue naming the packages PHP.  Steve
Langasek, however, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00224.html">\
explained</a> that Debian does indeed not have permissions to do so.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Expos Visibility.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20050218">announced</a> its presence at six
conferences and exhibitions: <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0222-consol">CONSOL</a> in Mexico City (February
22nd - 25th), <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0226-fosdem">FOSDEM</a> in
Brussels, Belgium (February 26th - 27th), <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0228-aosss">Asia Open Source Software Symposium</a>
in Beijing, China (February 28th - March 4th), <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0305-linuxtag-chemnitz">Chemnitzer Linux-Tage</a> in
Chemnitz, Germany (March 5th - 6th), <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0310-cebit">CeBIT</a> in Hannover, Germany (March
10th - 16th), and <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0311-itlinuxdays">IT/Linux
Days</a> in L&ouml;rrach, Germany (March 11th - 14th).  Several talks with
Debian affiliation will be held as well.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Package Status Graphs.</strong> Wouter Verhelst <a
href="http://www.grep.be/blog/2005/02/21/#bugs_packages_graphs">pondered</a>
whether to continue generating package status graphics.  There's a graph for
each developer email address that shows the evolution of the number of
packages, bugs, and the average number of bugs per package, e.g for the <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~wouter/graph/packages/packages@qa.debian.org.png">\
QA group</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 683: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-683">postgresql</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 684: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-684">typespeed</a> --

<li>DSA 687: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-687">bidwatcher</a> --
    Format string vulnerability.
</ul>

added to the unstable Debian archive <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/newpkg_main">recently</a> or contain
important updates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/capiutils">capiutils</a>
