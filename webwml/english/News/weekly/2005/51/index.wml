<p>Welcome to this year's 51st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Mohammed Adn&egrave;ne Trojette summarised the events from last
year and created the <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2004/timeline">timeline
2004</a>.  Thomas Lange <a
href="http://www.uni-koeln.de/bin2/maillist/linux-fai/20051213.170012/170506">\
announced</a> version 2.9 of FAI, the fully automatic installation for
Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on one DVD?</strong> Jaldhar Vyas <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/12/msg00089.html">reported</a>
that one of the problems GNU/Linux users in countries like India face is low
bandwidth.  Therefore a distribution on CD or DVD is preferred over large
network installations or updates.  He has found a sponsor and is looking for a
1-DVD version of the Debian system.  J&ouml;rg Jaspert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/12/msg00091.html">confirmed</a>
that the production is easy since he's done it before.</p>

<p><strong>Four Years debianforum.de.</strong> The web forum
<a href="http://debianforum.de/">debianforum.de</a>, aimed at German speaking
Debian Users, has had its fourth anniversary on  December 20th.
With discussions like "How to install a program" this forum has
turned into an important site for both the Debian beginner and the
professional in German speaking countries.  With booths on several GNU/Linux
Events the forum was also active outside the world wide web.</p>

<p><strong>Ballot: Declassification of private Mails.</strong> Manoj
Srivastava <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00075.html">called</a>
for <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/12/msg00080.html">\
vote</a> on the <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2005/vote_002">declassification of
debian-private list archives</a> from December 18th to December 31th.  When
passed a committee will be created that will seek to declassify and publish
mails of historical or ongoing significance made to the internal private
Debian mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>Simon Bienlein receives BIENE Award.</strong> <a
href="http://www.bienlein.com/">Simon Bienlein</a> (German), a
German Debian contributor has received the <a
href="http://www.biene-award.de/award/">BIENE award</a> (German).  Simon
contributes to the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">Debian
installer</a> and helped to make it fit for use with a braille terminal.  He
received the award for his <a
href="http://www.linux-fuer-blinde.de/">website</a> (German) on GNU/Linux for
blind people. The BIENE award is given annually to websites
whose accessibility is exemplary. Simon even received a special award.</p>

<p><strong>New apt-get and dpkg Guide.</strong> <a
href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/">All about Linux</a> a GNU/Linux focused
blog at blogspot.com published a nice <a
href="http://linuxhelp.blogspot.com/2005/12/concise-apt-get-dpkg-primer-for-new.html">guide</a>
on <code>apt-get</code> and <code>dpkg</code>. The article is catered for new users and explains
the most common applications of both programs. For more detailed
information on these programs you can also refer to Debian's own <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/apt-howto/">apt howto</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Using LSB conforming Init Scripts.</strong> Thomas Hood <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01309.html">wondered</a>
how he is supposed to use the <a
href="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.0.0/">LSB</a> compliant
functions for init scripts properly.  He noted that arbitrary output would
spoil the formatting.  Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01329.html">reported</a>
about ideas to send the output of scripts to the syslog server.  Henrique
Holschuh <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01343.html">added</a>
that the functions will even work when parallel init scripts execution is
implemented.</p>

<p><strong>Individually signed Packages.</strong> Marc Brockschmidt <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01325.html">reported</a>
about a change in the archive suite that caused individually signed packages
to be rejected.  Several people <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01337.html">stated</a>
that they would like <a href="https://packages.debian.org/dpkg-sig">\
dpkg-sig</a> to continue to work.  Marc <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01352.html">added</a>
that J&ouml;rg Jaspert planned to provide a better version of the problematic
check that will accept such packages again.</p>

<p><strong>TeX Live in Debian?</strong> Norbert Preining <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01649.html">reported</a>
about the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00970.html">genesis</a>
of <a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX live</a> for Debian after the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01654.html">packages</a>
have been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01651.html">rejected</a>
from the <a href="http://incoming.debian.org/">incoming</a> directory.  Frank
K&uuml;ster <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg01658.html">\
added</a> that several TeX live developers and users wanted a simple way to
install TeX live in Debian, replacing teTeX and keeping dependencies
in order.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Bug Closing.</strong> Roberto Sanchez <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00033.html">wondered</a>
if automatic closing of <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bugs</a> could be adjusted to
only work for bugs in the same source package since a typo in the bug number
will cause the wrong bug to be closed.  Matthew Palmer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00037.html">added</a>
that the close message does actually state the source package which closes the
bug.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Sarge updated.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20051220">announced</a> the first <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/3.1r1/">update</a> for the current <a
