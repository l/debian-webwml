<p>Welcome to this year's 46th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Members of the Debian-Edu sub-project have <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2005/10/msg00207.html">proposed</a>
codenames for the upcoming Skolelinux release such as Terra, Tellus and Oslo.
Adrian von Bidder was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00709.html">looking</a>
for very old Debian installation images that can still be found on <a
href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/historic-linux/distributions/debian/">\
ibiblio.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Status of Big Endian ARM Port.</strong> Lennert Buytenhek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00006.html">\
reported</a> that the big endian <a href="$(HOME)/ports/arm/">ARM</a> port has
seen steady progress in the recent weeks.  The sarge distribution is nearly
rebuilt and two build daemon are working on the unstable distribution, which
are both available from a separate <a
href="http://armeb.debian.net/debian-armeb/">server</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Travel Sponsorship for Debian Conference.</strong>  Andreas
Schuldei <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00004.html">\
offered</a> active Debian people limited travel sponsorship if they can't
afford the entire trip.  In order to be able to plan the budget he asked those
to <a href="https://www.debconf.org/comas/attendees/new">register</a> in
time.  A committee will later decide about the sponsoring options.</p>

<p><strong>Oldenburg DevJam Meeting Report.</strong> Arnaud Vandyck <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/11/msg00005.html">\
reported</a> that several Java people from different distributions have met at
the <a href="http://meeting.ffis.de/Oldenburg2005/java.html">DevJam</a> for
the first time.  Developers from different distributions and upstream packages
have <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/152664/">discussed</a> the state and
development of the free Java toolchain.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Clam AntiVirus Database Updates.</strong> Marc Haber <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile-announce/debian-volatile-announce-2005/msg00003.html">\
announced</a> that a script checks every 30 minutes if new virus patterns have
been released and rebuilds the virus database for <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/clamav">Clam AntiVirus</a> on the <a
href="http://volatile.debian.net/">volatile</a> host if necessary.  If all
tests are passed automatically
packages will be moved into the volatile archive.  Older packages are
automatically removed.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Etch Beta 1.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2005/11/msg00605.html">announced</a>
the first etch beta release of the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
debian-installer</a> and explained why the release took so long.  The most
time-consuming problem was chasing recently introduced bugs in various
packages the installer depends on.  Daily building installer images only
rarely result in working images, which needs to be improved.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Public License 1.1.</strong> Fathi Boudra <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00112.html">sought</a>
cover for the SugarCRM <a
href="http://www.sugarforge.org/content/open-source/public-license.php">\
license</a> which is based on the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html">Mozilla Public License 1.1</a>
(MPL).  Matthew Garrett <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00113.html">reported</a>
that various people believe that the MPL alone is non-free, however, Mozilla
is being <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00121.html">\
relicensed</a> under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
GPL</a> and, hence, stays in the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>FOSDEM: Call for Talks.</strong> Wouter Verhelst <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2005/11/msg00022.html">called</a>
for talks for the Debian room at the upcoming <a
href="http://www.fosdem.org/">FOSDEM</a> conference that will take place on
February 25th and 26th, 2006 in Brussels, Belgium.  The talks should a
technical issue and aimed towards people familiar with the Debian
project.</p>

<p><strong>License for Debian Conference Material.</strong> Francesco Poli <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00064.html">stated</a>
that <a href="http://www.debconf.org/">DebConf</a> speakers should be required
to publish their papier under a license compatible with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a>.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/11/msg00138.html">pointed</a>
out that Debian already distributes lots of content that isn't DFSG-free, such
as mailing lists and bug reports.</p>

<p><strong>October Debian-Installer Meeting.</strong> Christian Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00770.html">\
published</a> the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~bubulle/d-i/irc-meeting-20051019/minutes">\
minutes</a> of the sixth <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
Debian-Installer</a> team meeting held in October.  The progress on the GTK
installer has been amazing and all attendants agreed to make it available as
soon as possible.  Switching to <a href="http://packages.debian.org/udev">\
udev</a> became a major goal for the future.</p>

<p><strong>Development Package Dependencies.</strong> Gabor Gombas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00772.html">noticed</a>
problems in dependencies of development packages since linking statically and
dynamically requires differend packages and because some packages conflict
with each other since they provide the same files.  Russ Allbery <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/11/msg00000.html">\
explained</a> that the include file path is part of the programming interface
of the Kerberos implementation.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining basic Network Utilities.</strong> Noah Meyerhans <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00799.html">wondered</a>
how to best continue maintaining the <code>iputils</code> package that
provides basic network utilities such as <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/iputils-ping">ping</a> since the pristine
package is Linux-specific and doesn't compile or work on the <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd">Hurd</a> or <a href="$(HOME)/ports/kfreebsd-gnu/">\
kFreeBSD</a> port of Debian.  An official fork may lead into the proper
direction but could <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/10/msg00854.html">imply</a>
that new kernel features may be supported immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 890: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-890">libungif4</a> --
