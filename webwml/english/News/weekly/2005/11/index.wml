<p>Welcome to this year's 11th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Sean Finney <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00150.html">\
uploaded</a> the first version of the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~seanius/policy/examples/">\
dbconfig-common</a> package which implements a general database maintenance
interface and is intended to be used by other packages.</p>

<p><strong>DebConf 5 Call for Papers.</strong> On the 15th of March the <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/news/call_for_papers">Call for
Papers</a> for <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/">DebConf 5</a> will
end.  The list of <a
href="http://comas.linux-aktivaattori.org/debconf5/general/proposals">\
proposal</a> contains more than 20 items.  The review committee will make its
decision by April 1st. The Debian conference is most important event where
Debian developers and interested users meet to discuss about the Debian
project and its development.  This year DebConf will take place in <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/about/helsinki">Helsinki</a>, <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/about/finland">Finland</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Logo License.</strong> Francesco Poli <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00234.html">wondered</a>
if there has been any progress recently to change the license of Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/logos/">logos</a> to a free one.  Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/02/msg00241.html">answered</a>
that SPI's legal counsel has written a copyright assignment agreement and the
artist of the logo has agreed to sign it and thereby hand ownership over to
SPI.  Once this is done, the license can be changed.</p>

<p><strong>Automatic Integration of USB Storage.</strong> Martin Dickopp has
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/2004/10/msg00308.html">\
developed</a> a script that automatically mounts USB mass storage devices when
they are plugged in, and unmounts them when they are removed.  He <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00271.html">mentioned</a>
that similar functionality is included in the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/pmount">pmount</a> package when it is used as
part of the desktop together with the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/hal">hal</a> device manager, though.</p>

<p><strong>License for Documentation?</strong> Daniel Carrera <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00241.html">wondered</a>
which license he should use for documentation and came up with the idea to
co-license it with the <a
href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">Creative Commons
Attribution</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
GPL</a>.  Gervase Markham <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/03/msg00254.html">asked</a>
not to use the GPL for documentation as it wasn't designed for such but
admitted that there is no documentation-specific license that is considered
free by the Debian project.</p>

<p><strong>Key Management on USB Stick.</strong> David H&auml;rdeman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/03/msg00281.html">pondered</a>
about the best method to manage private keys (for SSH and GnuPG) on a USB
storage device.  The keys should be automatically available when the key is
inserted.  At the end he improved a <a
href="http://www.seanius.net/linux/keyloader/usb-storage">script</a> by Sean
Finney that uses a VFAT system with a loopback filesystem on top.</p>

<p><strong>Election Discussion Etiquette.</strong> In light of the high number
of project leader candidates Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00010.html">asked</a> all
participants to keep their mails brief, stay on-topic, trim the replied text
in the response, alter the subject when the content is changed and to be
polite.  Off-topic remarks may better be suited on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa/">debian-curiosa</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Status.</strong> Steve Langasek sent in a new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00012.html">\
status report</a> on the sarge release.  A modification on the SSH server on
the wanna-build host and on all buildds is required to cushion the load evoked
by the new <code>testing-security</code> queue.  After this change is in place
the archive will be frozen in connection with the third release candidate of
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NEW Queue Processing Proposal.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/random_idea_re_new_queue-2005-03-02-21-12.html">\
proposed</a> to share the burden of processing the queue of new packages among
more people and not only the ftpmasters.  Packages could be uploaded to an
alternative public new queue so that more developers could review the packages
and send back a re-signed <code>.changes</code> file to the main queue.  Once
a package was advocated by enough developers it could be processed more
automatically by the archive maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Project Leader Election IRC Debate.</strong> Martin F. Krafft <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00507.html">announced</a>
that the IRC debate for the upcoming project leader election will take place
on Wednesday, March 16th, at 06:00 UTC on the Freenode IRC network
(irc.debian.org).  It will use four IRC channels, whose logs are going to be
made available after the debate.</p>

<p><strong>Post-Sarge Release Plans.</strong> Steve Langasek announced <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/03/msg00012.html">\
plans</a> for the release after sarge that includes splitting the Debian
archive into a regular and a second class component with less frequently used
architectures.  This should reduce the mirror space and the time required for
keeping testing in shape since it will contain lesser architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Asia Debian Mini-Conf 2005.</strong> The first <a
href="http://debian.org.cn/events/admc2005/">Asia Debian Mini-Conf</a> was
successfully held as a part of the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0228-aosss">\
5th Asia Open Source Software Symposium</a> in Beijing, China.  Sun Wah Linux
kindly sponsored the meeting and invited several developers from around the
world to attend and give talks.  The <a
href="http://freelinuxer.net/~carlos/2005/03/asian-debian-mini-conf.html">\
meeting</a> also helped with integration among Debian communities in China,
Taiwan and Hong Kong, such as the resurrection of the Chinese Debian channel
\#debian-zh and some cooperation in translation work.</p>
