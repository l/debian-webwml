<p>Welcome to this year's 31st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Geert Stappers <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2005/07/msg00064.html">noted</a>
that the twelfth <a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6?output=gplain">\
birthday</a> of the Debian project will take place this month.  Simon Wright
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/06/msg00340.html">\
reported</a> that the Debian <a href="$(HOME)/logos/">swirl</a> is shipped as
standard brush in a proprietary commercial drawing program.</p>

<p><strong>Reviewing Package Descriptions.</strong> Wolfgang Borgert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01074.html">asked</a>
whether it was appropriate for package descriptions to include technical and
extraneous details.  While both sides were argued for, Lars Wirzenius <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01095.html">noted</a>
that many package descriptions contain other errors, and suggested that a
group should wade through the descriptions and improve them.  Clément Stenac
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01395.html">\
followed</a> up with a Wiki page <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/PackagesDescriptionsReview">documenting</a>
procedures and calling for volunteers.</p>

<p><strong>Services back up!</strong> Ryan Murray <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00018.html">\
announced</a> that the temporary migration of two important Debian machines to
HP has been completed successfully and their services have been restored.  All
hosting offers received will now be evaluated in order to decide on a more
permanent home for the two machines.  The ftp-master service has been moved to
spohr and developers can upload packages again.</p>

<p><strong>Popularity Contest.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01269.html">asked</a>
users to participate in the <a href="https://popcon.debian.org/">popularity
contest</a> by installing the <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/popularity-contest">popularity-contest</a>
package and saying "yes" to participation. The results are used to produce
Debian CDs and map the usage of packages and architecture distribution.  Erik
Schanze <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01297.html">\
suggested</a> that reports be zipped in order to ease the stress on
low-bandwidth machines.  Petter <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01431.html">responded</a>
that reports sent using HTTP already implement this, and that e-mail
compression is being worked on.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Accessibility Call for Help.</strong> Mario Lang <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg01330.html">called</a>
for help with the maintenance of accessibility related packages in Debian.  He
is searching co-maintainers for the <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/emacspeak">emacspeak</a> and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/kernel-patch-speakup">kernel-patch-speakup</a>
packages.  He is also looking for developers to help with specific tasks like
developing a framework for building drivers for proprietary software speech
synthesisers, researching the status of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gnopernicus">gnopernicus</a> with respect to
Java based applications and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/openoffice.org">OpenOffice.org</a>, and
providing an accessibility initrd for the Debian Installer CDs.</p>

<p><strong>Next Generation Init Scripts.</strong> Henrique de Moraes Holschuh
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/07/msg00017.html">\
announced</a> a new <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/initscripts-ng/">\ 
project</a> on <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a> to foster the
development, reference implementation and deployment of new init script
engines. All maintainers of init script subsystem packages and init
replacements are invited to participate as well as representatives from
derivated distributions that have an interest on the topic.  This project
intends to continue the work <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~hmh/debconf2/debconf2-initscripts-bkg.ps.gz">\
started</a> during <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0705-debconf">DebConf2</a>,
and rehashed during <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0710-debconf">\
DebConf5</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Full Debian ARM for under $200.</strong> Peter Korsgaard <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm/2005/07/msg00040.html">announced</a>
a <a href="http://peter.korsgaard.com/articles/debian-nslu2.php">howto</a>
about installing Debian on a Linksys <a
href="http://www1.linksys.com/products/product.asp?prid=640&amp;scid=43">NSLU2</a>.
The NSLU2 is a cheap consumer device containing a 266&nbsp;MHz ARM processor,
Ethernet, USB&nbsp;2.0, 8&nbsp;MB flash and 32&nbsp;MB SDRAM.  The
installation includes adjusting the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">endianness</a> of the machine
and the kernel and using the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
Debian installer</a> image for LART machines.  Attaching a USB hard disk makes
it a nice server.</p>

<p><strong>Report Mail as Spam.</strong> From now on there is another
possibility for the normal user to help the Debian project. A button has been
added to all mail pages  of the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">mailing list
archive</a> to report this mail as spam.  Everybody who finds a spam message
can click on the button to report it back to the listserver.  This will help
to improve the spam filter and to clean up the mailing lists from unwanted
messages.</p>

<p><strong>Alioth Documentation.</strong> Rapha&euml;l Hertzog started to
write some <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Alioth">documentation</a> on <a
href="https://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a> since its users often <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00404.html">ask</a> for
documentation and noticed the lack of it.  Users are invited to contribute to
this piece of documentation.  He pointed to the source of the modified version
of Gforge and invited people to contribute patches.</p>

<p><strong>Linux Trademark Issues.</strong> Bruce Perens <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/06/msg00277.html">wrote</a>
that the <a href="http://www.userlinux.com/">UserLinux</a> project has been
approached by the <a href="http://www.linuxmark.org/">Linux Mark Institute</a>
and that their <a href="http://www.linuxmark.org/forms/linux_licence_doc.html">\
license</a> doesn't seem to be compatible with Debian.  Stephen Frost,
however, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/06/msg00278.html">\ 
pondered</a> whether Debian's use wouldn't fall under the <a
href="http://www.linuxmark.org/who_needs.html">descriptive use</a> since it
refers to Linux as the kernel.  Bruce's main <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/06/msg00300.html">concern</a>
is that the license doesn't serve the community and its efforts but only
commercial entities.</p>

<p><strong>Patent Infringements.</strong> Daniel James <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00081.html">reported</a>
that <a href="https://packages.debian.org/xmms">XMMS</a> contains a library
that implements a patent-encumbered algorithm that requires a <a
href="http://www.mp3licensing.com/royalty/software.html">license</a>.  Steve
Langasek <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/07/msg00082.html">\ 
answered</a> that Debian includes this library because its patents are not
actively enforced.</p>

<p><strong>Skills and Rights of a Debian Developer.</strong> Bartosz Fenski <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00692.html">pondered</a>
whether Debian should split duties and rights instead of requiring every
registered developer to be a package maintainer, especially if they only want
to work on documentation and translations.  Maybe a good approach would be to
better integrate people who are not packaging software and hence don't require
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/07/msg00693.html">\
upload</a> permission.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at the ApacheCon Europe 2005.</strong> Meike Reichle wrote a
<a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0718-apachecon-report">report</a> about the
Debian presence at this year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0718-apachecon">\
ApacheCon Europe</a> that was held in Stuttgart, Germany.  She had also taken
the liberty to reproduce the long lost <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/mike.html">Mike</a> <a
href="http://www.youam.de/~alphascorpii/ApacheCon2005/slides/booth1.html">\
poster</a>.  Most attendees of this conference were professionals who have
known Debian already but the need for sarge DVDs was still high.</p>
