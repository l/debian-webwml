# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 23rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Now that Debian 3.1 has been released, people are keen to
celebrate this.  There may be a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.net/?ReleasePartySarge">party</a> in your
neighbourhood as well.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2005/000117.html">announced</a>
that <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">SPI</a>, Debian's legal umbrella, is
now able to accept donations via check from Canada.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Sarge released.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20050606">announced</a> the release of Debian GNU/Linux
3.1 alias sarge.  After three years of development, this release marks another
milestone in the history of Debian.  With more than 15,000 binary packages,
a lot of updated software and the new and shiny <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">installer</a> this release boosts
Debian back into the present.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with new Debian DVDs and CDs.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00003.html">\
reported</a> about a problem with the brand-new 3.1r0 CD/DVD images.  Due to
incorrect Release files on the images the apt resource for <a
href="$(HOME)/security/">security.debian.org</a> is not active.  As a result,
users who install from these images won't benefit from security updates
automatically.  New 3.1r0a images should be available when this issue is
released to correct this flaw.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at Code Fest Japan 2005.</strong> In the Japanese capitol
city, Tokyo,, <a href="https://members.fsij.org/trac/codefest2005/">Code Fest
Japan 2005</a> was held.  Around 40 hackers from all around Japan have
assembled for a 24-hour endurance hacking session.  A dozen Debian developers
from Japan and China attended the session and worked on Debian.  Hacking
included developments around Input Methods (im-switch), testing printers with
CUPS and porting Debian to the m32r architecture.  Participants left <a
href="https://members.fsij.org/trac/codefest2005/wiki/Record.en">notes</a> on
how they endured their 24 hours.</p>

<p><strong>Delaying the Release?</strong> Rickard Armiento <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/06/msg00031.html">brought</a>
up an <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/311683">issue</a> with KDE that several
people considered release-critical, although others believed that it's just a
normal bug.  The random screensaver of KDE, which is not activated by default,
ignores the settings of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/xscreensaver">\
xscreensaver</a> and randomises over all existing screensavers.  This includes
the WebCollage screensaver that loads random images from the network, which
can include offensive content.</p>

<p><strong>QA Goals for Etch.</strong> Shortly after the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20050606">release</a> of sarge, Frank Lichtenheld
mentioned his  <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/djpig/9260.html">\
goals</a> for quality assurance (QA) work for the etch release.  All packages
should installable and removable on a clean target, the number of overlapping
files needs to be minimised.  He would also like to fix the last twenty
packages that can't be installed non-interactively.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.10 in unstable.</strong> Josselin Mouette <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/np237/3413.html">reported</a> that
following the release, the GNOME team is in the process of moving GNOME 2.10
packages from the experimental repository to unstable.  The core libraries are
already installed, and the rest will follow within a few days.  A handful of
packages will require updates to their .desktop files so that they appear
correctly in the menus.</p>

<p><strong>Library ABI Changes.</strong> Philipp Kern <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01394.html">wondered</a>
what to do besides updating the soname if the maintainer notices that the
application binary interface (ABI) of the library is changed.  Hamish Moffatt
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01405.html">\
explained</a> that an advantage of keeping the old library in section
<code>oldlibs</code> for a while is less hassle for local admins with
self-compiled binaries.  Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01414.html">added</a>
that when the package name is changed as well, older versions will stay on the
admin's system.</p>

<p><strong>Keysigning without personally meeting.</strong> Wesley Landake <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01435.html">proposed</a>
a guideline to sign other people's keys without meeting them in person.  This
method was soon revealed as weak since <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01466.html">falsifying</a>
a graphic is no crime, because a notary is not as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00014.html">trustworthy</a>
in every country and because the web of trust is entirely <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00001.html">self-contained</a>,
without putting any trust on government and state official.  In short,
keysigning requires to meet in person for a reason.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Java in Sarge.</strong> Arnaud Vandyck gave a rough <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00002.html">\
overview</a> about what has changed between woody and sarge with Java on
Debian.  Most notably sarge contains improved and new free Java runtime
environments.  In addition to that, a lot of software got packaged and moved
to the main section.  Java packages are also group-maintained via <a
href="http://pkg-java.alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
