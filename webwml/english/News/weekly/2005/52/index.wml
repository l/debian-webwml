<p>Welcome to this 52nd and thus last issue of this year of DWN, the weekly
newsletter for the
Debian community.  Merry Christmas to those readers who celebrate the
Christian event and a Happy New Year to all of you who feel like celebrating
New Years Eve.  In an <a
href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.asp?p=431711&amp;rl=1">essay</a>
David Chisnall took a look at the cost of Free Software in connection to the
freedom people gain by using Free Software.</p>

<p><strong>Package Backports for Sarge.</strong> Norbert Tretkowski <a
href="http://www.inittab.de/blog/2005/12/16#20051216_sarge">announced</a>
that <a href="http://www.backports.org/">backports.org</a> eventually supports
the current stable Debian <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">release</a>
code-named sarge.  Debian developers can upload their backported packages into the
archive.  Norbert also provided some <a
href="http://www.backports.org/instructions.html">notes</a> on using
backports.org for end users and <a
href="http://lists.backports.org/lurker/message/20051207.140929.3a97ba5c.en.html">\
developers</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Debian KDE Team in an Interview.</strong> The <a
href="http://pkg-kde.alioth.debian.org/docs/people.html">Debian KDE team</a> has been
<a href="http://people.kde.nl/debian.html">interviewed</a> by "The people
behind KDE", a site that aims to present the people involved in the KDE
community. The interview features technical aspects as well as a some
personal questions.</p>

<p><strong>Status of Debian unstable.</strong> Kamaraju Kusumanchi <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00621.html">started</a>
a Wiki <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/StatusOfUnstable">page</a>
to summarise up current major unstable upgrade issues and to give some
workarounds to users.  Ari Pollack <a
href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/go_team_ari/11093.html">announced</a>
another Wiki <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/TopicDebianDevel">page</a>
tracking the topic of the #debian-devel channel on irc.debian.org which
provides a useful idea of what is broken and what is fixed in <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/sid/">sid</a>.
However, he recommends the use of apt-listbugs/apt-listchanges and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce">debian-devel-announce</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Common Power Management Framework.</strong> Kevin Locke <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00044.html">announced</a>
the creation of a project to create a common power-management <a
href="http://powermgmt.alioth.debian.org/">framework</a> for Debian.
Developers will be able to respond to power-related events, regardless of
architecture or daemon by installing a single script for the common
event handler.  This script will be properly handled even as new power-systems
and daemons are created with no necessary changes from the developer.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel Package Hooks Transition.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00012.html">\
warned</a> about new versions of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/kernel-package">kernel-package</a> which may
produce binary kernel packages whose <code>postinst</code> script fails, even
though the kernel will work fine.  This is a result of the conversion to <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/debconf">debconf</a> and scripts that expect
an interactive installation script or produce output.</p>

<p><strong>Next Release Architectures.</strong> Steve Langasek, member of the
Debian <a href="http://release.debian.org/">release team</a>, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/12/msg00013.html">\
announced</a> the end of the architecture requalification <a
href="http://release.debian.org/etch_arch_qualify.html">phase</a>.  As an
outcome, the next stable Debian release called <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> probably won't support the <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/arm/">arm</a>, <a href="$(HOME)/ports/m68k/">m68k</a>, <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/s390/">s390</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/sparc/">sparc</a> architectures.  However, it will support
the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/amd64/">amd64</a> architecture for the first time.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla and Friends based on XULRunner?</strong> Mike Hommey <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg00082.html">reported</a>
about his plans to package <a
href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php/XUL:Xul_Runner">xulrunner</a>, which
ought to become the central engine for all future Mozilla technology, meaning
that all Mozilla products (firefox, thunderbird, etc.) will be built on top of
it.  The mid-term plan is to migrate the applications that use Mozilla as a
platform (such as epiphany, galeon, kazehakase, etc.) to xulrunner.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in Munich.</strong> The city of Munich <a
href="http://www.muenchen.de/vip8/prod2/mde/_de/rubriken/Rathaus/40_dir/presse/2005/ru/246.pdf">\
published</a> an update about their <a
href="http://www.muenchen.de/limux">migration</a> to a Debian-based GNU/Linux
solution.  The current steps are to migrate their document management to an
OpenOffice-based solution so that both the current windows clients and the new
GNU/Linux clients can use it. They also shipped the first test versions of the
Debian-based client to users in order to get feedback.  The client
administration is based on <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> (fully automatic
installation) and GOsa (Gonicus System Administrator).</p>
