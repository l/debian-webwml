<p>Welcome to this year's 25th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Jordi Mallach <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.10-unstable-2005-06-14-21-01">\
reported</a> that the GNOME team has completed all uploads needed to bring
GNOME 2.10.1 into unstable.  With the presence at this year's LinuxTag and the
first sarge DVD after the release this will become a hectic week for European
Debian people.</p>

<p><strong>Woody to Sarge Upgrades.</strong> Bill Allombert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00006.html">\
summarised</a> the major problems people have reported in upgrade reports.
Circular dependencies in woody and the dependency of <code>apt-get</code> and
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/aptitude">aptitude</a> on C++ seem to be
the most problematic ones.  There are far too many packages that alter
configuration files for which <code>dpkg</code> requires approval before
overwriting them.</p>

<p><strong>The Debian Legacy.</strong> Nick Myra <a
href="http://os.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=05/06/13/1430228">reported</a>
about the sarge release and that Debian's popularity has inspired dozens of
variants, many of them run directly from CD.  Knoppix and its derivatives have
encouraged the current growth in GNU/Linux users.  Debian helps show that
GNU/Linux and its broader social, political, and economical implications are a
force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p><strong>SELinux and BSD Ports.</strong> Aurelien Jarno <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00012.html">\
reported</a> about problems for the BSD ports of Debian with the integration
of SELinux support to regular packages.  Since SELinux is Linux-specific
these patches won't work on the BSD ports and the Hurd.  He added a code
snippet that adds proper support for <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/libselinux1">libselinux1</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Menu System Update.</strong> Bill Allombert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00013.html">\
reported</a> about improvements done in the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/menu">menu</a> package during the
preparations of sarge on which packages may now depend.  Translations of menu
sections, different character sets and XDG menus are now supported.  He also
asked developers to let the menu item start with a capital letter and to move
menu files to <code>/usr/share</code> in order to support the <a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in embedded Systems.</strong> The fifth annual <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4036830962.html">market
survey</a> reported that Debian was the most popular distribution.  The
OpenEmbedded project appears to be a notable up-and-comer.  It began as the <a
href="http://linuxdevices.com/links/LK3443415155.html">OpenZaurus</a> project,
and then evolved into a cross-platform build system supporting a wide variety
of embedded targets.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project on Tour.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2005/20050617">announced</a> its presence at the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0620-oss2005">OSS Symposium</a> for business and
public administration in Ostfildern, Germany, at this year's <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0622-linuxtag">LinuxTag</a> and at the fifth <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0710-debconf">Debian Conference</a> in Helsinki,
Finland.  The finalised <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2005/day.html">schedule</a>
of Debian related talks during <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>
contain archive descriptions, sub-projects, detailed use cases, porting and
a lot more.</p>

<p><strong>Javi's Etch Wishlist.</strong> Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00462.html">outlined</a>
wishlist items for the next Debian release.  The list contains several
improvements into a more security hardened system, rollback mechanism for
upgrades, an alternate boot system, the switch to <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/xinetd">xinetd</a>, the need for better
documentation, improved package search and tracking mechanisms and much
more.</p>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL Transition.</strong> Martin Pitt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00500.html">announced</a>
that the switch to a new architecture of PostgreSQL packages is being
implemented now.  The new structure is a lot easier to maintain and also
offers many new <a href="http://people.debian.org/~mpitt/postgresql-ng.html">\
features</a> for users.  All packages that formerly depended on
<code>postgresql-dev</code> need to be altered and uploaded again.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Mini Conference in Japan.</strong> Yukiharu Yabuki <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00517.html">\
announced</a> a mini Debian conference taking place on October in Osaka,
Japan.  He already organised a Debian birds of a feather session at the Kansai
OpenSource conference.  At least some talks will be given in English.</p>

added to the unstable Debian archive <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/newpkg_main">recently</a> or contain
