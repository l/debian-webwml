<p>Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  A lot of activity has still been recorded on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/">debian-release</a> list in
order to fix the remaining <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">release-critical</a> bugs and
to get the translations into shape.  Matt Whipp <a
href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/69766/open-source-not-running-short-of-developers.html">\
quoted</a> several people to counter the claim that Free Software is running
short of developers.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Desktop with 12 Watts.</strong> Silas Bennett wanted to run
a low-power desktop system and ended up using a <a
href="http://www.apple.com/macmini/">Mac mini</a>.  He <a
href="http://www.home.earthlink.net/~silasb/macbat/">described</a> that he had
removed the hard disk and CD-ROM drive to save power and space that he could
reuse with a battery pack, so that the system draws 12 watts from it.  He was
also delighted to see the sarge installer run flawlessly.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/Hurd running GNOME and Qt.</strong> Michael Banck <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2005/05/msg00109.html">managed</a> 
to get GNOME compile and run on GNU/Hurd, albeit with some caveats and loose
ends, and also took a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~mbanck/media/hurd-gnome.png">screenshot</a>.
Several packages had to be modified in order to make them build, so
that GNOME won't be uploaded for hurd-i386 soon, but the general issues
seem to have been solved.  In related news, Qt is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd/2005/04/msg00082.html">running</a>
fine on the Hurd as well, and volunteers are sought after for
porting KDE.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to the weekly WNPP Posting.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00012.html">\
announced</a> that the weekly mail about work-needing and prospective <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">packages</a> won't be sent to the announce list
anymore but to the dedicated <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-wnpp/">\
debian-wnpp</a> list instead.  In addition to that, future mails will only
include new entries in order to have the mails be helpful again.</p>

<p><strong>Confusing Package Versions.</strong> Nico Golde <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01023.html">noticed</a>
that the most recent version of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unrar">\
unrar</a> has a lower version number than the packages before.  Roberto
Sanchez <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01024.html">\
explained</a> that the old package was non-free and has been replaced by a
free version with a lower version number.   Unfortunately it can't <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01029.html">cope</a>
with current RAR 3.x archives.  The free version has since then been renamed
into <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unrar-free">unrar-free</a> to avoid
confusion.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging Waste.</strong> Romain Beauxis wanted to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00444.html">package</a>
<a href="http://waste.sourceforge.net/">waste</a> a collaboration tool for
small teams.  Mirco Bauer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/05/msg00353.html">noted</a>
that the authors considered this <a
href="http://www.nullsoft.com/free/waste/">unauthorised software</a>.  It
seems that Nullsoft's parent company AOL didn't agree to the release, hence
the strong message.</p>

<p><strong>Last Update to Woody.</strong> Joey Schulze <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00013.html">\
sent</a> in the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/3.0r6/">\
preparation</a> for the last update to Debian 3.0.  As usual, this mostly adds
recent security updates to the woody release.  He also <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200505130653">explained</a> that
there can't be another update after the release of sarge due to deficiencies
in the archive <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/dak/?cvsroot=dak">suite</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Non-US being phased out.</strong> Frans Pop <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01163.html">proposed</a>
a paragraph about the end of the non-US archive to be added to the <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/releasenotes">release notes</a> since it is
dysfunctional and not needed anymore.  From the 29 <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01354.html">packages</a>
still included, only five haven't been able to be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg01355.html">moved</a>
into the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Volatile Strategy.</strong> The volatile team <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00016.html">\
pondered</a> to create a second <a href="http://volatile.debian.net/">\
volatile</a> archive with less strict criteria.  This would help packages such
as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gaim">Gaim</a> that need to be updated
during the lifetime of sarge in order to support modified protocols.  They are
also looking for ways to announce updated packages.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 724: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-724">phpsysinfo</a> --
    Cross site scripting.
<li>DSA 725: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-725">ppxp</a> --
