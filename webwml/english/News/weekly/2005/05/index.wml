# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 5th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Andreas Schuldei <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00014.html">\
announced</a> that the <a
href="http://comas.linux-aktivaattori.org/debconf5">registration</a> for this
year's Debian conference has been opened.  Og Maciel <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9516">installed</a> Debian for
the first time and thought that the expert mode was appropriate, giving him
the opportunity to answer all 27 questions of which only a fraction would be
displayed during a normal installation.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Developer Room at FOSDEM.</strong> Wouter Verhelst <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2005/01/msg00064.html">\
announced</a> the talk schedule for the Debian developer room during this
year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0226-fosdem">FOSDEM</a> taking place at
the end of February.  The talks will cover the release process, embedded
Debian, the Debian Women project, the Hurd, porting, quality assurance and
more.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with missing Dependencies.</strong> Frank Küster <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01644.html">wondered</a>
why the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/">Debian policy manual</a> uses the
word "should" and not "must" when it comes to the requirement to add
dependencies to packages which are used in maintainer scripts.  John Hasler <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01669.html">added</a>
that they are used to distinguish the significance of the various guidelines.
Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01670.html">explained</a>
that the significance for the sarge release is defined in the <a
href="http://release.debian.org/sarge_rc_policy.txt">release policy</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Library Packaging Guideline.</strong> Pierre Ancelot <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01646.html">wondered</a>
why the <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/column/libpkg-guide/libpkg-guide.html">\
library packaging guide</a> is not yet integrated into the official <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/developers-reference/">developers reference</a>.  Andreas
Metzler <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01648.html">\
pointed out</a> that it is already linked from there.  Junichi Uekawa <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01746.html">added</a>
that this document is rather a recommendation that should be followed as long
as there are no good arguments against it.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL related Packages Transition.</strong> Steve Langasek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01757.html">discussed</a>
a late transition of packages linking against MySQL libraries.  Before, the
MySQL maintainer, upstream developers, and others have worked on fixing the
license so that it meets the needs of the software that Debian distributes.
Andreas Metzler <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01774.html">pointed
out</a> that there is still a license problem with packages that also link to
the OpenSSL library.  This seems to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01777.html">break</a>
the whole plan, though.</p>

<p><strong>Woody to Sarge Upgrade?</strong> Henning Glawe <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01784.html">noticed</a>
that circular dependencies prevent a normal upgrade from woody to sarge using
<code>apt-get</code>.  The version in  sarge works around this by increasing
the length of the argument list fed into <code>dpkg</code>.  Steve Langasek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01821.html">added</a>
that the release notes recommend to use <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/aptitude">aptitude</a> for upgrading.</p>

<p><strong>Gettext Script in Binary Directory.</strong> Jochen Voss <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01797.html">noticed</a>
that the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gettext">gettext</a> package
installs a shell script component in the <code>/usr/bin</code> directory with
execute permissions removed.  In <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/284637">\
Bug#284637</a> Bruno Haible <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=284637&amp;msg=6">\
explains</a> that it is meant to be included in shell scripts and needs to be
installed in this location.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01893.html">proposed</a>
to add a <code>SOURCEPATH</code> variable to the shells.</p>

<p><strong>New 2005 Debian Archive Key.</strong> Several people noticed a
problem with the Debian archive recently, like <code>apt-secure</code> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01843.html">failing</a>.
Steve Kowalik <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01844.html">revealed</a>
that the archive key for 2004 has been expired and apparently <a
href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> failed to create a signature with it
leading to empty files.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01898.html">created</a>
a new <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2005.asc">archive key</a>
and noted that it's almost four years that Debian started with a signature chain
but it is still not even supported by mainline software in Debian unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Squashing Party.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00017.html">\
announced</a> the next bug squashing party to take place from February 4th to
6th with coordination in #debian-bugs on irc.debian.org.  The number of
release critical <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">bugs</a>
is around 100 for several days already.  Targets will be packages that lack
the license text for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU
FDL</a>, long-standing and complex bugs, QA uploads and work on removed
packages.</p>

<p><strong>Wishlist for Talks during DebConf 5.</strong> Lars Wirzenius <a
href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2005-01.html#20050128c">pondered</a> about
talks he would like to have at the upcoming <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5">Debian conference</a> that will take
place in Helsinki in summer.  Among others the list contains very practical
talks like writing good manpages, tutorials and documentation, using gettext,
understanding Unicode, adding test cases to packages, identifying security
problems.</p>

<p><strong>Temporary Exclusion of mipsel Architecture.</strong> Steve Langasek
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/01/msg00178.html">\
informed</a> the developers that the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/mips/">mipsel</a>
architecture will be ignored for the propagation of packages into testing.
This is only a temporary measure in order to let a number of release critical
bugfixes migrate into testing.  The port will have an opportunity to catch up
down before the release.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 659: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-658">libpam-radius-auth</a> --
    Insecure temporary file.
<li>DSA 660: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-660">kdebase</a> --
    Authentication bypass.
<li>DSA 661: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-661">f2c</a> --
    Insecure temporary files.
<li>DSA 662: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-662">squirrelmail</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
</ul>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following packages were
added to the unstable Debian archive <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/newpkg_main">recently</a> or contain
important updates.</p>

<ul>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages.</strong> 3 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer.  This makes a total of 241 orphaned packages.  Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community.  Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">WNPP pages</a> for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
