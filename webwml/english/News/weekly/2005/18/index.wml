# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 18th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  As a hint of a working testing queue, the first package has
been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-changes/2005/05/msg00000.html">\
uploaded</a> directly into testing.  Many people are pleased that the <a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html">NEW</a> queue is
processed again.  However, Anand Kumria <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00380.html">suggested</a>
packages should be referred to the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/tech-ctte">technical
committee</a> when a decision had not been made within two months.</p>

<p><strong>Leadership Team Meeting.</strong> Andreas Schuldei sent in the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00401.html">minutes</a>
of the leadership team meeting last week in which he was appointed as
secretary.  Topics discussed during the meeting were a contact address,
funding, for attendance at <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1111445162/">aKademy
2005</a> in particular and a new name.
Additionally they resolved to invite Benjamin Hill to join the team.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with PHP Application Design Flaws.</strong> Martin Schulze
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2005/04/msg00103.html">\
asked</a> about PHP applications that have non-silent include files placed in
the web directory.  Such files are accessible via HTTP and can be used for
cross-site scripting <a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0870">\
attacks</a> or <a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0459">\
disclose</a> information unintendedly.  Henrique Holschuh <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2005/04/msg00106.html">added</a>
that configuration files should reside in <code>/etc</code> and not be
accessible from the outside.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Update.</strong> Andreas Barth sent in another <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00023.html">\
status report</a> on the sarge release.  The infrastructure for
testing-security is more or less in place and two new ARM buildds have been
added.  He explicitly  noted that all packages in sarge need to build from
source.  He also asked for no uploads with major changes to unstable which
could cause problems in sarge.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Administration Website.</strong>  Steve Kemp
posted an <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/?article=131">update</a>
on his Debian administration <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/">\
website</a>.  The site is now getting about 2,500 article views per day.  Some
of the tips and tricks about maintaining Debian computers that originally
appeared in English have also been translated into
<a href="http://www.debianusers.pl/">Polish</a> and
<a href="http://www.debian-tr.org/">Turkish</a>.
The site is also available to be
<a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/?about=Syndication">syndicated</a>
for <acronym title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</acronym> users.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Conference Update.</strong> Andreas Schuldei <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00022.html">\
announced</a> the final list of talks for the upcoming conference and reported
that Debian has received more then &euro;&nbsp;100,000 as donations.  As a
novelty this year the Debian team will present Debian to the natives one day
before the conference.  He encouraged the attendees to use the meeting for
working together with other developers face to face.</p>

<p><strong>Policy for Scheme Implementations.</strong> Jorgen Sch&auml;fer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg01000.html">reported</a>
that the <a href="http://srfi.schemers.org/">Scheme Requests for
Implementation</a> process is trying to <a
href="http://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-22/srfi-22.html">standardise</a>
interpreter names for Scheme scripts.  Since this introduces a name conflict
if two implementations of Scheme both want to support this scheme he proposed
a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~forcer/debian-scheme-policy/debian-scheme-policy.html/">\
Scheme policy</a> for Debian that asks for the interpreter name to be managed
by <code>update-alternatives</code>.</p>

<p><strong>State of Debian.</strong> Linux Weekly News <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/132521/">reported</a> on Bdale Garbee's talk at
this year's Debian <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0418-linuxconf">\
mini-conference</a> at Linux Conference Australia.  He talked about how
leadership works in Debian and introduced the project leadership team (SCUD).
He also floated a proposal to replace the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/leader">DPL</a> with an elected board.  This would require
an amendment to the Debian <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">\
constitution</a>, though.  The idea is still in the early stages, and will be
further discussed in July at this year's <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf5/">Debian Conference</a> in Helsinki,
Finland.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Squashing Long Weekend.</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00000.html">\
announced</a> the bug squashing weekend from May 5th to May 8th.  It will
start on Thursday since in many countries this day is a holiday.
After all freeze blockers seem to be gone finally, it's time to work on the
remaining release blockers.  He asked developers to work on important and
security bugs as well, in addition to release-critical bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Release Team Meeting.</strong> Andreas Barth posted <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/05/msg00008.html">minutes</a>
of release team meeting in which the sarge release was discussed.  They came
to the conclusion that the freeze can get into effect as of now.  When the
archive is frozen, the release team will accept corrections for important and
above bugs, l10n and documentation updates via unstable.  Via
testing-proposed-updates, only release-critical bug fixes, l10n and
documentation updates are accepted.</p>

<p><strong>Web Applications in Debian.</strong> After a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2005/04/msg00103.html">\
discussion</a> on PHP applications and due to the large number of web
application packages Neil McGovern <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg01144.html">asked</a>
for a mailing list to handle such topics.  Alexis Sukrieh would also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg01147.html">like</a> to
extend the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/">Debian Policy Manual</a> with
regards to web applications.  Pascal Hakim finally <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg00075.html">created</a>
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-webapps/">list</a>.</p>
