# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 39th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Ben Hutchings <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/09/msg00011.html">\
announced</a> the availability of video DVDs of the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0710-debconf">DebConf</a> talks.  There has been
some <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00235.html">\
effort</a> to convert the content of the old Wiki to the new <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/">Debian Wiki</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Collecting Boot Data.</strong> Jörg Sommer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01661.html">wanted</a>
to know where on the filesystem an <code>init</code> replacement could store
its data.  Martin Krafft <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01663.html">\
suggested</a> to keep the data in memory and dump them to a file at the end of
the boot process.  Later Jörg <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01722.html">explained</a>
that the data will be stored temporarily in <code>/run</code> and moved to the
final destination.</p>

<p><strong>GL Library Duplication.</strong> Michael Biebl <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01816.html">wondered</a>
why both X.Org and Mesa provide GL/GLU implementations as libraries and
if there is an attempt to switch to only one of them in the long term.
Marcelo Magallon <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/08/msg01886.html">\
explained</a> the contents of the affected packages and that the user should
know which driver they need.</p>

<p><strong>Support for Libc Version 5.</strong> Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00109.html">wondered</a>
how long the old libc5 packages need to be supported by Debian, since libc6
has been released 7 years ago and since the Debian project does not provide
security support for it.  Roger Leigh <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00136.html">added</a>
that Debian is the only common distribution that still ships binary packages
for the older libc and suggested its <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/323139">\
removal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Common Packaging Errors.</strong> Lars Wirzenius <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00137.html">reported</a>
on widespread packaging bugs that he noticed during a <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/piuparts">piuparts</a> run over the archive.
These <a href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/temp/piuparts-old-logs">runs</a> help
detecting files that aren't included in the packages but also aren't removed
during the installation or upon package removal.  They are also able to detect
calls to external programs on which packages don't properly depend.</p>

<p><strong>Debian OpenSolaris Port?</strong> Andreas Schuldei <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00227.html">encouraged</a>
developers to take part in <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/os/discussions/">discussions</a> about the <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/forum.jspa?forumID=32">license</a> of
OpenSolaris with regards to a Debian <a
href="http://www.opensolaris.org/jive/message.jspa?messageID=5914">port</a>.
The license is currently not approved by Debian due to its choice of venue <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/09/msg00310.html">clause</a>.</p>

<p><strong>NTP License Problems.</strong> Nathanael Nerode <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00280.html">discovered</a>
several differently licensed pieces of code in the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/ntp">ntp</a> package.  Some of them don't
seem to be distributable by Debian at all.  Bdale Garbee <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/09/msg00315.html">identified</a>
the problems and proposed to remove questionable code from the package.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<li>DSA 817: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2005/dsa-817">python2.2</a> --
