# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 22nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Andreas Barth prepares for after the release already and
tried to <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01173.html">\
optimise</a> the LDAP gateway to the <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bugtracking
system</a>.  Nokia has <a
href="http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS3716070830.html">released</a> an Internet
tablet PC that uses Debian as operating system.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Update.</strong> Andreas Barth sent in the next <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00020.html">\
status report</a> about the upcoming sarge release.  The number of
release-critical bugs is still too high so the release is postponed by one
more week.  He also mentioned that all update requests need to be reviewed
manually which consumes a lot of time.</p>

<p><strong>New Archive Section: video?</strong> Philipp Kern <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01229.html">wondered</a>
when a set of packages warrant the introduction of a new archive section.  He
heard from several users who were looking for multimedia players and got lost
in the <code>graphics</code> section.  He also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01237.html">noted</a>
that some players are currently even in the section of their corresponding
desktop environment.</p>

<p><strong>End of debian-legal Summaries?</strong> Frank Lichtenheld <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/05/msg00525.html">wondered</a>
if the <a href="$(HOME)/legal/licenses/">legal summaries</a> that he had
created should be removed again.  Shortly after their creation this effort was
stalled since nobody wrote summaries anymore.  For many discussions this
proved to be difficult if not impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for the Debian Conference.</strong> Anibal Monsalve
Salazar <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01198.html">\
asked</a> for GnuPG keys to be submitted for the keysigning party at the
upcoming <a href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0710-debconf">Debian conference</a>.
Gunnar Wolf <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00017.html">\
asked</a> all attendees to check their personal information and to add final
for food requirements.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Day at LinuxTag 2005.</strong> Joey Schulze <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/05/msg00021.html">\
announced</a> the schedule for this year's <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2005/day.html">Debian
day</a>, a mini-conference that is traditionally held during <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0622-linuxtag">LinuxTag</a> which takes place from
June 22nd to 25th in Karlsruhe, Germany.  The talks will describe certain
parts of the distribution or the project and will be held in English.  For the
first time the mini-conference will be continued on a second day.</p>
