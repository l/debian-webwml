# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 17th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  According to analyst house IDC, Free Software is <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/04/18/oss_gains_in_europe/">gaining</a>
ground in Europe, as one third of mid-to-large sized companies in Europe
report significant use of a Free Software database management system.  The <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00324.html">leadership
team</a> had its first meeting whilst this issue was being prepared.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.10 uploaded into Experimental.</strong> Jordi Mallach <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-2.10-experimental-2005-04-18-18-37">\
reported</a> that most of the pieces of the 2.10 puzzle have been uploaded into the
experimental distribution and many people are already using it.  Since newer
versions of a few libraries are needed they were temporarily packaged by the
GNOME team and uploaded to their own repository until newer versions make it
into Debian.</p>

<p><strong>GFDL and Debian.</strong> Matthew Garrett <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00108.html">\
explained</a> in a discussion about the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
that Debian wants freedom for everybody.  Matthew Wilcox <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00127.html">\
drafted</a> the Debian Free Documentation <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~willy/dfdocg-0.4.txt">Guidelines</a> that
define slightly different goals or freedoms for documentation than for
software.</p>

<p><strong>User Poll: Remove non-free Documentation?</strong> Brian Nelson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2005/04/msg01851.html">conducted</a>
a poll on whether to <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.xhtml">remove</a>
all <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GNU FDL</a>-licensed
documentation.  He has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00238.html">published</a>
the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~pyro/fdl_poll_results.txt">results</a>
and emphasised some textual <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~pyro/fdl_poll.mail">answers</a> that several users
gave.  Only a few people have <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00272.html">\
participated</a> in this survey, though.  The majority of them don't want
those documents removed entirely but for many it is ok to move them into
non-free.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Day Call for Papers.</strong> Alexander Schmehl <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/2005/04/21#CfP-Debian-Day">called</a> for talk
submissions for this year's <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2005/day.html">Debian
day</a>, a one day conference for and by Debian developers and affiliates.  It
will take place on Thursday, 23rd of June during the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0622-linuxtag">LinuxTag</a> conference
and exhibition in Karlsruhe, Germany.  The audience for the Debian Day is
expected to mostly consist of experienced users and developers.  Interested
speakers should drop <a href="mailto:alexander@schmehl.info">him</a> a
note.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and mplayer FAQ.</strong> MJ Ray <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00454.html">announced</a>
a draft <a href="http://people.debian.org/~mjr/mplayer.html">FAQ</a> covering
the situation of <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">mplayer</a> in the Debian
distribution.  The document summarises former discussions on the debian-legal
list on this topic.  He also explains that a new version has been uploaded and
awaits ftpmaster approval and that all questionable code has been removed.</p>

<p><strong>Debian AMD64 Meeting.</strong> A Debian AMD64 porters IRC meeting
took place on April, 23th where the main topic of discussion was the
unofficial release of the AMD64 port
for sarge and the move from <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a> to
a new machine with more disk space.  Several people have
been assigned tasks for the upcoming release.  The new machine will be hosted
at the <a href="http://www.tu-darmstadt.de/">University of Darmstadt</a>. A <a
href="http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/irc-summary.txt">summary</a> and
the <a href="http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/irc-log.txt">IRC log</a>
are available.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian Consultants Policy.</strong> The
Debian consultants team has published the new
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00096.html">\
policy</a> for additions to the <a href="$(HOME)/consultants/#policy">\
consultants web page</a>.  A working e-mail address is now required by policy
for all listed consultants and those who haven't provided one should  contact the
<a href="mailto:consultants@debian.org">consultants team</a> and update
their record.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project Leader Report.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/04/msg00019.html">\
sent</a> in his first project leader <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/reports/2005-04-24.html">\
report</a> in which he talks about sarge release issues, the ARM buildds,
Debian assets around the world, interviews he gave, and more.  Other issues were a
backup site for <a href="http://snapshot.debian.net">snapshots</a> and a more
comprehensive backup strategy for machines critical to Debian's
infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>One Year Debian Employment.</strong> Joey Hess sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-edu/2005/04/msg00131.html">summary</a>
about the past year in which he was employed by SLX Debian Labs to work on
debian-edu.  He compared the items on his todo list with the work actually
done, which boils down to a lot of work towards the release of sarge.
Additionally, he just <a
href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/moving-2005-04-25-01-23.html">\
moved</a> his installer test farm into a remote rack.</p>

<p><strong>Importance of the Snapshot Service.</strong> Adrian van Bidder <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00327.html">wondered</a>
if the <a href="http://snapshot.debian.net/">snapshot</a> service shouldn't be
promoted to an official debian.org service in recognition of its value to the
project.  Martin Schulze <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/04/msg00333.html">explained</a>
that it has been very helpful for security work when older package versions
have had to be reviewed.</p>

<p><strong>AMD64 Port Status.</strong> Andreas Jochens <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/04/msg00884.html">tried</a> to
build the current testing distribution for the AMD64 architecture from scratch
which took only about one week on a standard single processor EM64T-P4 box.
This was very promising since almost all packages build on this architecture
without problems using the pristine Debian sarge sources.</p>
