# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 24th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Last week has seen a lot of discussion on release goals and
the release team for etch.  Several people are already keen on discussing the
preparation and timing for the next release.  Branden Robinson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/05/msg00092.html">\
explained</a> where news about <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a>
should be sent to instead of using private mail.</p>

<p><strong>Release Policy Changes.</strong> Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2005/06/msg00157.html">proposed</a>
a few changes to the release policy for the upcoming release of etch.  When
libraries are provided, other programs should link against them dynamically
instead of duplicating its source, build-dependencies must be static.  The
section about PIC libraries probably needs a technical discussion first.</p>

<p><strong>C++ ABI Changes.</strong> Matthias Klose <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00004.html">\
announced</a> that the application binary interface (ABI) for C++ will be
changed in unstable.  All packages that contain shared libraries written in
C++ will have to be renamed.  After that, all packages that depend on these
need to be uploaded again.  Therefore unstable is frozen with regards to C++
libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Scheduling Talks for DebConf 5.</strong> Don Armstrong <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00007.html">\
called</a> for <a
href="http://comas.linux-aktivaattori.org/debconf5/attendees/account/voting/">\
votes</a> on the talks people would like to listen to at the upcoming <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2005/0710-debconf">Debian Conference</a> in Helsinki,
Finland. In order to reduce the likelihood that two talks that people really
wish to attend are scheduled for the exact same time, the scheduler will
attempt to minimise the conflicts between talks according to the vote.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge for AMD64 released.</strong> JÃ¶rg Jaspert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00005.html">\
announced</a> that the AMD64 archive is declared stable as well.  In general
this release is the same as for the official <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">\
ports</a> in Debian, with only a few modified packages and several <a
href="http://amd64.debian.net/docs/package_changes.txt">removed</a>.  Security
Support for this release is planned to be provided by the Debian Security Team
via <a href="$(HOME)/security/">security.debian.org</a>.

<p><strong>Debian for the Geeks.</strong> Bruce Byfield has written a <a
href="http://os.newsforge.com/os/05/06/10/1512236.shtml?tid=2">review</a> of
the new Debian release.  He acknowledges the benefits the new <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">installer</a> brings and that this
release uses current versions of many packages.  However, <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/aptitude">aptitude</a> doesn't seem to be a
particularly easy program and several video cards were not detected
automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Development of dpkg.</strong> Scott James Remnant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/06/msg00010.html">\
reported</a> that the current development branch 1.13 of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/dpkg">dpkg</a> has been uploaded into
unstable.  The new version contains improved handling of architectures,
especially for splitting the cpu architecture and the underlying operating
system kernel.  The values for several variables have been changed to reflect
reality better, but has the potential to break existing build scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Proficiency-level for Debian Packages?</strong> Mark Edgington <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/05/msg01443.html">wondered</a>
if it would be useful to add a field to the package description indicating the
minimum proficiency level that a user should have in order for a package to be
useful.  Enrico Zini <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00205.html">thought</a>
about this as well but admitted, that it is difficult to measure "easyness"
universally.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Package Customisation.</strong> Roberto Sanchez <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00238.html">announced</a>
his <a href="http://familiasanchez.net/~sanchezr/?page=debcustomize">howto</a>
about the customisation of Debian packages.  The document starts with setting
up <a href="https://packages.debian.org/pbuilder">pbuilder</a> for building the
customised packages and explains how to create a new package version by adding
a new changelog entry.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and SELinux.</strong> Luke Leighton <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00465.html">wondered</a>
if there has been any progress turning the library <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/libselinux1">libselinux1</a> into a required
package.  Stephen Frost <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00468.html">explained</a>
that it's working the other way round and that e.g. <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/coreutils">coreutils</a> needs to add a
dependency itself.  Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/06/msg00735.html">added</a>
that using a library does not mean using SELinux.</p>
