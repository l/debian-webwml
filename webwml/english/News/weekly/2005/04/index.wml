<p>Welcome to this year's 4th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Marc Haber <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01327.html">\
announced</a> experimental packages of <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/exim4">Exim4</a> linked against db4.2 for
later inclusion in to sarge/sid.  OSNews has a <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=9271">guideline</a> on using the
new <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> to install
Debian by Luis Lima.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Progress Update.</strong> Steve Langasek sent in
an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00011.html">\
update</a> on the release progress for Debian 3.1. He reported that KDE
3.3 has been added to sarge and a porter upload for perl had taken place, 
which dropped the release critical bug count about 60 bugs. He also
stated that progress in testing-proposed updates and testing-security
has been made but is still waiting for infrastructure.</p>

<p><strong>Status Update for volatile Archive.</strong> Andreas Barth <a 
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2005/01/msg00012.html">\
reported</a> about the status of <a href="http://volatile.debian.net/">\
debian-volatile</a>.  This unofficial archive aims at supporting fast moving
packages for the stable Debian release like spam filter, virus scanner and the like.
He and his team have set up the infrastructure and 
<a href="http://volatile.debian.net/mirrors.html">mirrors</a> for it.
A first package, <a 
href="http://volatile.debian.net/debian-volatile/pool/main/w/whois/">\
whois</a> has been accepted for debian-volatile's section of woody.</p>

<p><strong>Renaming Binary Packages.</strong>  Jay Berkenbilt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01047.html">wanted</a>
to rename a package in order to loose the version in the package name.  To
achieve this he planned to create a new source package and convert the old
package into transitional packages only.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01061.html">explained</a>
that the name of a library name does not have to match its soname and believes
that no transitional packages need to be provided when Conflicts, Provides and
Replaces fields are carefully crafted.</p>

<p><strong>Support for DevFS?</strong> Russell Coker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01067.html">stated</a>
that devfs is regarded as obsolete in the kernel source and will be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01072.html">removed</a>
in July 2005.  However, the new <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
installer</a> is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01070.html">based</a> on
it.  Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01129.html">asserted</a>
that Debian will not destabilise the installer by beginning to make large changes
to it, like not using devfs, until sarge is released.</p>

<p><strong>Changing the Architecture of a Package.</strong> Jay Berkenbilt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01049.html">wondered</a>
if the change from <code>any</code> to <code>all</a> in a Debian package would
require manual intervention.  Santiago Vila <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01053.html">asserted</a>
that such a package could enter the archive even faster, since it is built for
11 architectures "instantly".</p>

<p><strong>Debian Women IRC meeting.</strong> The Debian Women group held an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2005/01/msg00050.html">IRC
meeting</a> on January 16th.  The topic discussed
was "How to best convey the purpose and goals of the Debian Women
project to those who have questions about it."  Prior to the meeting, Jérémy
Bobbio <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2005/01/msg00093.html">\
raised</a> the question of the best way to
organise and moderate IRC meetings, especially when non-native English
speakers are present.  The meeting was well attended and provoked lively
discussions.  <a
href="http://women.alioth.debian.org/wiki/index.php/English/IRC16January2005">\
Minutes</a> were <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-women/2005/01/msg00093.html">taken</a> by
Colleen Hatfield.</p>

<p><strong>Spurious Permissions Changes.</strong> Otto Wyss <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01124.html">noticed</a>
that permissions on a program he added the setuid flag were changed back
permanently.  Peter Sammuelson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01125.html">contributed</a>
the proper <code>dpkg-statoverride</code> command and Maciej Dems <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01155.html">added</a>
that it would be better to use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/sudo">\
sudo</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Depending on a particular Kernel Package.</strong> Martin Kittel <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01277.html">wondered</a>
if it is sensible to declare a dependency on a kernel image package since
arguments were raised in a former <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01236.html">discussion</a>
that not all users have the Debian kernel installed.  Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/01/msg01309.html">\
explained</a> that the job of a dependency is to make sure that another
package is installed so its provided content can be used.  The kernel is a
different case.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla Foundation Trademark Proposal.</strong> Gervase Markham
from the Mozilla Foundation <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00503.html">proposed</a>
a trademark agreement for Debian Firebird and Thunderbird packages.  Walter
Landry <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/01/msg00596.html">\
pointed out</a> that people outside of Debian would still be unable to legally
modify and redistribute packages.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
