<p>
Debian Weekly News is in need of contributors. Putting out Debian Weekly
News evey week is a lot of work for a small team, but you can help with only a
small amount of time spent each week. We need people who read some
mailing lists which we don't read and summarize threads in them.
We also need people who keep an eye on <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>, <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">DebianHELP</a>, <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.org/">DebianPlanet</a> and other online resources.
If you are interested in helping, please read this page to the end 
and <a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">contact us</a> in time.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do to contribute is send us an email at latest each Monday. In the
email just put short paragraphs, each summarizing a thread or event from the
mailing list or online resource you are reporting on. In parentheses, include the Message-Id of
any messages it would be useful for Debian Weekly News to link to. If
possible please include a link to the respective article at
&lt;<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">http://lists.debian.org/</a>&gt;. If
you prefer, you can send it at any time over the weekend before.

The following describes the way how DWN is currently produced by Joey.
</p>

<ol>

<li> Right after an issue of DWN is released, Joey will start with an
     empty new issue.  The issue is online at <a
     href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/Writing/DWN/">Joey's private
     website</a> which is available using <a
     href="http://cvs.infodrom.org/public_html/src/Writing/DWN/?cvsroot=infodrom.org">\
     anonymous CVS</a> as well.

<li> Through the entire week he will spontaneously add items and links
     to the issue.

<li> At the weekend he usually scans through the mailing lists and
     adds prominent items to the upcoming issue.

<li> Anybody, who would like to add an item to DWN or who has an issue
     that should be mentioned in the next DWN, should contact <a
     href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">us</a> at any time with enough
     information.

<li> The preview of DWN will be released to the inner circle on Monday
     evening UTC.

<li> Joey will send the preview to dwn@debian.org for review by the DWN
     team and to dwn-trans@debian.org for those who wish to work on
     early translations.

<li> All translators may start to translate the issue right away, since
     not many things in the original file are subject to change at that
     late stage.

<li> The first version of the upcoming issue of DWN will be comitted to
     CVS on Tuesday after the last but one webwml run, but before the final webwml
     run, which will update the web pages in the evening.  That's subject
     to happen at around 15:00 UTC or during the evening UTC.  This will be
     CVS version 1.1 and is same version of DWN which was sent out the
     day before.

<li> This is the time when translators may upload their first
     translation into the webwml CVS repository as well.

<li> The first update to the original issue of DWN (CVS version 1.2)
     will reflect updates Joey has received until that time.  Basically,
     there will be more security updates, new and orphaned packages
     added as well.  As an exception there may also be added a new
     paragraph for urgent issues.

<li> No reformattings will be made to the source, allowing all
     translators to find out all relevant changes through »cvs diff«.

<li> Every version Joey sends out for proofreading will reflect one
     version in CVS so versions can be traced more easily.  He will try
     to find a native english speaker for proofreading before
     finalizing any issue, but may fail to find a properly suited
     person, though.

<li> When DWN is due to be released, at about 19:45 UTC on Tuesday,
     at least a first version of translations will be available on the
     web server and some translations could be posted to the list
     server about simultaneously (German and Portuguese have their own
     lists, for example).

<li> The worst thing that can happen to translations on the website is
     that the online version when Joey releases DWN is not accurately
     up-to-date with the english version.  Every translator has to
     decide whether that is ok for you or not.
</ol>

<p> This is what Joey is offering, hoping that producing DWN will be
less harmful and more efficient in the future.</p>
