<p>
Debian Weekly News is in need of contributors. Putting out Debian Weekly
News every week is a lot of work for a small team, but you can help with only a
small amount of time spent each week. We need people who read some
mailing lists which we don't read and summarize threads in them.
We also need people who keep an eye on <a
href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a>, <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">DebianHELP</a>, <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.org/">Debian Planet</a> and other online resources.
If you are interested in helping, please read this page to the end 
and <a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">contact us</a> in time.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do to contribute is send us an email at latest each Monday. In the
email just put short paragraphs, each summarizing a thread or event from the
mailing list or online resource you are reporting on. In parentheses, include the Message-Id of
any messages it would be useful for Debian Weekly News to link to. If
possible please include a link to the respective article at
&lt;<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">http://lists.debian.org/</a>&gt;. If
you prefer, you can send it at any time over the weekend before.
Please see the guidelines below.
</p>

<h3>DWN Style Guidelines</h3>

<p>Length - Items should be exactly one paragraph long.  All
paragraphs should be of similar length, so that they are not too long
for reading but contain all relevant information.</p>

<p>Content - Items should have some direct relevance or interest to those in the
Debian community.  In light of Debian's Social Contract, purely non-free
software should not be the centre of a news item, but may be mentioned if
relevant.</p>

<p>Impartiality - DWN attempts to be an unbiased "Newsletter of Record" for the
Debian community.  News items should fairly reflect the event as it happened
or the discussion as it took place.  In any large community there will often
be opposing views and DWN's role is to report on these, rather than to judge
them.</p>

<p>Regional Spelling Variations - Where spelling of words differs
between regions, DWN prefers British English to American English.  For
example, standardise rather than standardize.</p>

<p>Headings - Names and subjects in headlines should be capitalised.</p>

<h3>DWN Production</h3>

<p>
To understand how DWN is technically written and produced, please
learn how this website <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website">works</a> and
take a look at the CVS <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/using_cvs">\
repository</a> that is used.
</p>

<p>
The following describes the DWN production cycle with Joey as main editor.
</p>

<ol>

<li> Right after an issue of DWN is released, Joey will start with an
     empty new issue.  The issue is online at <a
     href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/Writing/DWN/">Joey's private
     website</a> which is available using <a
     href="http://cvs.infodrom.org/public_html/src/Writing/DWN/?cvsroot=infodrom.org">\
     anonymous CVS</a> as well.

<li> During the entire week he will spontaneously add items and links
     to the issue.

<li> At the weekend he usually scans through the mailing lists and
     adds prominent items to the upcoming issue.

<li> Anybody, who would like to add an item to DWN or who has an issue
     that should be mentioned in the next DWN, should contact <a
     href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">us</a> at any time with enough
     information.

<li> The preview of DWN will be released to the inner circle on Monday
     evening UTC.  All submissions for the upcoming issue should be
     sent in until the preview is released.

<li> Joey will send the preview to dwn@debian.org for review by the DWN
     team and to dwn-trans@debian.org for those who wish to work on
     early translations.

<li> All translators may start to translate the issue right away, since
     not many things in the original file are subject to change at that
     late stage.

<li> The site www.debian.org is updated automatically every four
     hours.  All changes and new material, which is included in the
     CVS repository, is included in each run.  Hence, there is a four
     hour window where updates can be made to CVS that don't result in
     an immediate update of the web server.  DWN will use this window
     as much as it can.

     <p>This means that the first version of the upcoming issue of DWN
     (the version which was sent out to translators on the day before)
     will be committed shortly after this window starts.  That is
     subject to happen at around 14:00 UTC.  This will be CVS version
     1.1.

<li> This is the time when translators may upload their first
     translation into the webwml CVS repository as well.

<li> The first update to the original issue of DWN (CVS version 1.2)
     will reflect all updates and corrections Joey has received until that time.  Basically,
     there will be more security updates, new and orphaned packages
     added as well.  As an exception there may also be added a new
     paragraph for urgent issues.

<li> If possible no reformattings will be made to the source, allowing all
     translators to easily find out all relevant changes through »cvs diff«.

<li> Every version Joey sends out for proofreading will reflect one
     version in CVS so versions can be traced more easily.  He will try
     to find a native English speaker for proofreading before
     finalizing any issue, but may fail to find a properly suited
     person, though.

<li> All corrections to DWN should be sent to the DWN team via mail
     and not committed to CVS directly, even if a couple of versions
     are available in CVS.  After the issue has been released via
     mail, additional corrections may be made directly to the CVS
     version.  Please accept that corrections committed directly to
     the CVS version cannot be handled properly before the issue is
     mailed out.

<li> When DWN is due to be released, at about 18:45 UTC on Tuesday,
     at least a first version of translations will be available on the
     web server and some translations could be posted to the list
     server about simultaneously (German and Portuguese have their own
     mailing lists, for example).

<li> The worst thing that can happen to translations on the website is
     that the online version when DWN is released is not accurately
     up-to-date with the English version.  Every translator has to
     decide whether this is ok for the particular translation or not.
</ol>

<p>This process has helped make the production of the DWN more
efficient (and less traumatic for Joey).</p>
