<p>
Debian Weekly News is in need of contributors. Putting out Debian Weekly
News is a lot of work for a small team, but you can help with only a
small amount of time spent each week. We need people to read lists we
don't read and summarize. We also need people to help us summarize
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a>.
If you're interested in helping, read this page for details
and <a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">mail us</a> to work out what lists you
will help with.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do to contribute is send us an email each Monday. In the
email just put short paragraphs, each summarizing a thread or event from the
mailing lists you are reporting on. In parentheses, include the Message-Id of
any messages it would be useful for Debian Weekly News to link to. If
possible please include a link to the respective article from
&lt;<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">http://lists.debian.org/</a>&gt;. If
you prefer, you can send it at any time over the weekend before.
</p>

<p>
Partial drafts of the next issue of Debian Weekly News can be found 
<a href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/Writing/DWN/">on Joey's personal
machine</a>, generally starting around Thursday of each week, and developing
as the week goes on. We also appreciate anyone who wants to look at these
drafts and send us corrections to them before they are published.
