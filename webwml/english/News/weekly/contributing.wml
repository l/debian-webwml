Debian Weekly News is in need of contributors. Putting out Debian Weekly
News is a lot of work for a single person, but you can help with only a
small amount of time spent each week. I need people to read lists I
don't read and summarize them. I also need people to help me summarize
debian-devel. If you're interested in helping, read this page for details
and <a href="mailto:joey@kitenet.net">mail me</a> to work out what list you
will help with.
</p>

<p>
All you need to do to contribute is send me an email each Monday. In the
email just put short paragraphs, each summarizing a thread or event from the
mailing list you are reporting on. In parentheses, include the Message-Id of
any messages it would be useful for Debian Weekly News to link to. The
absolute deadline for me receiving this message is 11:59pm PST on Monday. If
you prefer, you can send it at any time over the weekened before.
</p>

<p>
Drafts of the next issue of Debian Weekly News can be found 
<a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/debian.org/News/weekly/">on my personal
machine</a>, generally starting around Thursday of each week, and developing
as the week goes on. I also appreciate anyone who wants to look at these
drafts and send me corrections to them before they are published.
</p>
