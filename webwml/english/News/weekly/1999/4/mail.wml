Here we go again.  There weren't many comments or suggestions on the last
version so I think we're getting close to a formal proposal to change.  Note,
we've removed the clause that requires the copyrights to be displayed during
execution.  It doesn't affect the GPL as version 2.  Are there any
license/packages that it DOES affect?

Remember, the parts in &lt;braces&gt; will be removed in the final version.  We've
just included them as comments as we work this out.

There could still be problems, even spelling errors.  As they say, release
early release often.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1. Introduction 
----------------

     The Debian Free Software Guidelines define what it means for software
     to be free as far as the Debian project is concerned. Software that
     follows these guidelines is termed "DFSG-free".

     These guidelines are separated into two sections: a list of freedoms
     we require of DFSG-free software and a list of restrictions on those
     freedoms that we are willing to accept.


1.1. Application
----------------

     These guidelines are intended to be applied to software programs, that
     is, machine-readable programs that instruct a computer how to perform
     specific tasks, its source code, and any other items included with the
     original source distribution.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. Requirements 
----------------


2.1. Use 
---------

     Anyone must be able to use the software in any way without paying a
     fee or royalty or performing special actions.

     &lt;I think this line would prohibit "button-ware."&gt;

     &lt;Not specifically part of the old DFSG&gt;

     &lt;This does not prohibit the author from asking for donations as long
     as the donations are completely voluntary.&gt;


2.2. Source Code 
-----------------

     Source code must be freely available.

     &lt;Old DFSG point 2&gt;


2.3. Distribution 
------------------

     Anyone must be able to give away or sell copies of the executables and
     sources without paying a fee or royalty. However, nobody can be
     required to distribute the software.

     &lt;Old DFSG point 1. Also part of Old DFSG point 5 & 6 unless you think
     the DFSG needs a phrase like "does not discriminate" instead of
     "anyone". Point 8 could also be part of this but this phrase would
     cover more than just Debian. For example, under the old DFSG, software
     could bar Red Hat from distributing it and still be DFSG (at least as
     far as point 8.)&gt;

     &lt;The license may not make any restrictions on who redistributes the
     software or how that work is redistributed.&gt;


2.4. Modified and Derived Software 
-----------------------------------

     Anyone must be able to use and distribute the software (source or
     executables) with modifications and anyone must be able to distribute
     software that uses parts of the licensed source.

     &lt;part of old DFSG point 3 and part of point 7&gt;


2.5. Termination of License 
----------------------------

     The license must remain valid until the licensee terminates it or
     violates the terms of the license

     &lt;Not part of the old DFSG&gt;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. Restrictions 
----------------


3.1. Notices of Authorship 
---------------------------
     The license may require the copyright, license, and any associated
     disclaimers be prominently displayed in the modified software or any
     derived software. The license may require such notices to be
     displayed: (in order of preference) 

        * wherever the modified/derived software displays copyrights

        * in the source code or documentation

        * in advertising materials (deprecated)

     &lt;Not part of the old DFSG&gt;

     &lt;during execution of the software -- removed. Will this affect any
     current licenses?&gt;


3.2. Misrepresentation of Authors 
----------------------------------

     The license may restrict the use of names and trademarks of the
     copyright holders in association with modifications of the original
     software.

     &lt;Not part of the old DFSG&gt;

     &lt;It can restrict the unauthorized use of the names and trademarks of
     the copyright holders even to promote something derived from the
     original software&gt;


3.3. License of Derived Works 
------------------------------

     The license can require modified and derived software be distributed
     under the same license or the general requirement "any compatible
     license."

     The license may also require the license of modified and derived
     software be restricted to the same license or to any license that
     meets these software has the choice of license as long as they meet
     these guidelines.

     &lt;Also part of old DFSG point 7&gt;

     The license can impose license restrictions on the third party
     software (such as libraries) necessary to compile the software as long
     as the restrictions are compatible with the original license.

     The license my not impose restrictions on third-party software that
     merely resides on the same system or distribution as the licensed
     software.


3.4. Restrictions on charges (deprecated) 
------------------------------------------

     The license can restrict the amount charged for the software if
     reasonable distribution fees are allowed. It may not place
     restrictions on either fees charged for other software in a
     distribution or the cost of a distribution as a whole.


3.5. Availability of source code 
---------------------------------

     The license may require that distributors make a reasonable effort to
     provide source code to versions of the software they distribute.

     &lt;Not specifically part of the old DFSG&gt;


3.6. Integrity of the Original Work 
------------------------------------

     The license may use any of the following methods to ensure the
     integrity of the original work:

     &lt;Old DFSG point 4&gt;

3.6.1. Change log 
------------------
     A summary of modifications made to the software may be required in: 

        * the source code of the modified software.

        * documentation accompanying the modified software.

     &lt;I removed this. Is there any license that requires this that we want
     to remain DFSG-free? "the display when the software is executed (for
     interactive programs)"&gt;

     &lt;Is there anywhere else they could be summarized that we'd accept?&gt;

3.6.2. Versioning and Renaming 
-------------------------------

     Modified software may be required to use a version number or name
     different than the official release.

3.6.3. Concurrent Installation (deprecated) 
--------------------------------------------

     Modified software may be required to be able to exist on the same
     system as the official release of the software.

     &lt;For example by requiring derived works to use different names for
     configuration files and data files as well as executables.&gt;

3.6.4. Original source (deprecated) 
------------------------------------

     Distribution of modified software may be required to be accompanied by
     an offer to distribute the original source code.

3.6.5. Patch clause (deprecated) 
---------------------------------

     Source level modifications may be required to be distributed as the
     original source with a list of differences.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. Notes &lt;This section, "Notes" is an explanation section to help clarify
the above document. It should not contain anything that's not above and the
document above should be able to stand on it's own without the "notes"
section&gt;
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


4.1. Deprecated 
----------------

     By deprecated, we mean this is allowed but discourage and disliked.
     These items may be done away with in future versions. Also, software
     without deprecated clauses is recommended over software that has
     licenses with such clauses.


4.2. Non-binding Requests 
--------------------------

     The license may make any number of non-binding requests. These should
     be clearly separated from the binding section of the license.


4.3. Weaker Restrictions 
-------------------------

     The license may make weaker restrictions than the above.


4.4. Source Code 
-----------------

     These guidelines use the term source code to refer the the preferred
     form of the work for making modifications to it.

     &lt;These guidelines use the term "source code" in the same way as does
     the GNU General Public License version 2: the source code for a work
     means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it.&gt;


4.5. Example Licenses 
----------------------
     As examples, we consider the following licenses DFSG-free: 

        * the MIT/X Consortium License

        * the Artistic License

        * the GNU General Public License (GPL)

        * the GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)

        * the BSD License

        * the Mozilla Public License (MPL)

        * the Q Public License (QPL)

     *gt;This list is a list of possibilities. Before the document would be
     released, the list would be modified to mention the licenses that
     truly do fit&lt;

Subject: Debian logo &amp; its license

For the Nth time our logo license has expired. It might be a good idea
to finally finalize the license instead of just extending its lifetime
every couple of months.

There has also been mention of people wanting a different logo. I think
we should stick to our current logo for several reasons though:

* it is a good logo: it's easily recognizable, simple to draw, scales
  good and looks good in both black&amp;white and in colour.
* choosing a new logo will take a long time: we would have to get
  submissions, vote on them all over again, etc. 
* I actually like the thing :)

I propose that we vote on accepting both the logo and the current
license.

Wichert.
