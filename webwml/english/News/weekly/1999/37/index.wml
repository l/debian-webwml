<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
<b>The boot floppies team is in need of a leader.</b> Enrique Zanardi
has stepped down (19990922144450.A1822@molec3.dfis.ull.es) from leading the
boot floppies effort due to time constraints. The good news is that with
some recent fixes (19990923100950.A29470@cistron.nl), the unstable boot
floppies finally build and work on i386 platforms again. And it will
probably take another floppy to install the next release of Debian; the
rescue floppy has been split in two to allow today's larger kernels and libc
to fit on it.

<li>There's been a lot of coverage of the Corel problem, including some in
the mainsteam press such as this 
<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/990922/2891977.html">article</a>
in the Ottawa Citizen. To hear Corel's side of the story, see this
Linux Today <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/10357.html">article</a>
"<i>The restrictions on reproduction and distribution of the Beta version of Corel
LINUX contained in the Beta Testing Agreement are intended to apply only to those
components of Corel LINUX that were independently developed by Corel without the use
of Open Source software.</i>" This 
LinuxWorld 
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-09/lw-09-corelbeta.html">article</a>
is also worth reading.
