<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="db"></a>
<b>The Developer Database is now on-line.</b> With the 
<a href="https://db.debian.org/">web</a> and <a href="mail#mail1">mail</a>
interfaces to the database, developers can enter various information about
themselves, including contact information, vacation status, latitude and
longitude, and passwords for some of the project's machines. The best thing
to come out of it so far is the
<a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/developers.loc">developer map</a>,
which shows just how global a project Debian is. Developers are encouraged
to add their coordinates to the database.

People who want to download CD images are now walked through a very clever
question and answer process at
<a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/">cdimage.debian.org</a>, designed to
weed out those who don't really need a CD image from those who do, and let
people in the former group know about better alternatives. The really clever
bit is the <b>new method for downloading Debian CD's</b>. In the past,
cdimage.debian.org and its mirrors were frequently overloaded as people
downloaded huge files from them. The new method allows any normal Debian
mirror be used as a CD image mirror -- without containing CD images! If that
piques your curiosity, read all about it
<a href="http://panic.et.tudelft.nl/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/README">here</a>.

<b>The boot floppies team is in need of a leader.</b> Enrique Zanardi
has <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9909/msg00200.html">stepped
down</a> from leading the boot floppies effort due to time constraints. The good
news is that with some
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9909/msg00216.html">recent
fixes</a>, the unstable boot floppies finally build and work on i386 platforms
again. It will probably take another floppy to install the next release of
Debian; the rescue floppy has been split in two to allow today's larger kernels
and libc to fit on it.

<p>
<b>Should it be possible to install more than one daemon of the same type at
the same time?</b> Currently it's not; the packages conflict because they need
to bind to the same port. While it's rare to need two pop daemons or two web
servers on the same system, it's 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01912.html">not
unheard of</a>, and some people want to be able to do it with Debian. Others
go <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01967.html">a step
further</a> and would prefer daemons do not start automatically when installed.
Both of these desires would lead to additional prompting at install time, at
best, although debconf could 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01980.html">alleviate
this</a>. No consensus has been reached on this issue.
</p>

As usual a

summary</a> of news from the Debian JP project is available.

<b>Followups</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>There's been a lot of coverage of the Corel problem, including some in
the mainsteam press such as this 
<a href="http://www.ottawacitizen.com/business/990922/2891977.html">article</a>
in the Ottawa Citizen. This LinuxWorld
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-09/lw-09-corelbeta.html">
article</a> is also worth reading.
To hear Corel's side of the story, see this
<a href="http://linuxtoday.com/stories/10357.html">letter</a>
in which they state that
"<i>The restrictions on reproduction and distribution of the Beta version of
Corel LINUX contained in the Beta Testing Agreement are intended to apply only
to those components of Corel LINUX that were independently developed by Corel
without the use of Open Source software.</i>"
</ul>
