<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The freeze has been postponed until November 7th</b>.
The Release Manager was unable to coordinate the freeze this past weekend.
The bugsquash party did go ahead as planned, and around 75 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical bugs</a>
were fixed in one day. Read Richard Braakman's <a href="mail#2">email</a> for
details about how the freeze will work, including the new "<i>Test Cycles</i>"
process.
</p>

<p>
<b>Build dependencies</b> are being discussed again this week. A proposal
specifying how they will work has been accepted and should be in the next
version of policy, which is due out soon. Using that as a base, Roman Hodek
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9910/msg00318.html">
posted</a> a "<i>vision for the future</i>" of how build dependencies can be
used by different programs in the future. But Julian Gilbey
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9910/msg00322.html">points
out</a> that figuring out what a package really depends on to build, to
generate the build dependencies entry, can be quite hard.
</p>

<p>
Ben Collins has made an <b>experimental version of dpkg</b> available, with
several <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg02053.html">
new features</a> that have been wanted for a long time, including internally
signed packages, and bzip2 compression support.

Last week Debian Weekly News dropped the ball when we didn't mention a
<b>copyright problem with apt and Corel's "<i>get_it</i>" apt frontend</b>, which
is a Qt program. Since it was linked to the GPLed libapt, there was a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9910/msg00045.html">licence
conflict</a>.
Jason Gunthorpe and Corel quietly <a href="mail#1">resolved</a> this
problem by changing apt's license to allow linking apt and Qt. Linux Weekly
News laster posted an interesting <a href="http://www.lwn.net/1999/1028/">
editorial</a> about this. It seemed the issue was closed.
</p>

<p>
Then this week, Ian Jackson brought up
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9910/msg00118.html">another
issue</a>: "<i>lib-apt isn't the only thing that is bound together at run-time
with Qt in this program.  dpkg is too - the fact that the interface is program
call rather than dynamic linking is an irrelevant technical detail.</i>" Ian
isn't about to change dpkg's license, and he is presumably talking with Corel
about this in private. Meanwhile, this spawned a long, murky thread on
debian-legal, since the law is very unclear on this and many people,
including RMS and Bruce Perens,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9911/msg00018.html">
disagree</a> with Ian's reasoning.
</p>

<p>
<b>BIND is once more in main.</b> A 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg02195.html">patch</a>
from Paul Vixie allows easy removal of the non-free DNNSEC code.
</p>

<p>
