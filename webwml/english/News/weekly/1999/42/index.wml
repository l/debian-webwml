<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
The freeze has been postponed until November 7th. The Release Manager didn't
have time this past weekend to handle the freeze. The bugsquash party did
go ahead as planned, and around 75 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical bugs</a>
were fixed in one day.

Build dependancies are being discussed agian this week. A proposal
specifying how they work has been accepted and should be in the next version
of policy, which is due out soon. Using that as a base, Roman Hodek posted
(yfScAD.A.XwH._QvF4@murphy) a "<i>vision for the future</i>" of how build
dependancies can be used by different programs in the future. Julian Gilbey
points out (E11gTtg-0002Yr-00@polya) that figuring out what a package really
depends on to build, to generate the build dependancies entry, can be quire
hard.

Ben Collins has made an experimental version of dpkg available, with several
new features, including internally signed packages, and bzip2 compression
support. (19991027232014.A228@lappy.djj.state.va.us)

Last week Debian Weekly News missed reporting on a 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-legal-9910/msg00045.html">licence
problem with apt and Corel's "<i>get_it</i>" apt frontend, which is a Qt
program. Since it was linked to the GPLed apt, there was a licence conflict.
Jason Gunthorpe and Corel quietly resolved (381E3088.2B7160F0@corel.ca) this
problem by changing apt's license to allow linking apt and Qt. Linux Weekly
News laster posted an interesting <a href="http://www.lwn.net/1999/1028/">
editorial</a> about this. It seemed the issue was closed.
</p>

<p>
Then this week, Ian Jackson raised
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-legal-9910/msg00118.html">another
issue: "<i>lib-apt isn't the only thing that is bound together at run-time
with Qt in this program.  dpkg is too - the fact that the interface is program
call rather than dynamic linking is an irrelevant technical detail.</i>" Ian
isn't about to change dpkg's license, and he is presumably talking with Corel
about this in private. Meanwhgile, this spawned a long, murky thread on
debian-legal, since many people including RMS and Bruce Perens disagree
(19991101162336.E25227@mors.net) with Ian's statement.
</p>

<p>
BIND is once more in main. The new BIND sources allow easy removal of the
non-free DNNSEC code. (199910300730.BAA03481@chunks.gag.com)
