<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
The technical committee has 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-ctte-9909/msg00023.html">spoken</a>:
<b>/usr/doc/&lt;package&gt; will be provided as a symlink in FHS compliant
packages</b>. This started an avalanche of updated, FHS compliant packages.
For implementation details, see
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-ctte-9908/msg00038.html">this message</a>
(debhelper will handle most of this automatically).
</p>

<p>
<b>The latest release of bind contains crypto code that is not DFSG free.</b>
Thus the DNS server, a major component of Debian, or of any unix system, has
become non-free -- a very bad situation. It looks like removing this code or
maintaining the older, free version of bind would be
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg00367.html">very hard</a>.
One alternative that is being looked at is using the new dents DNS server. Perhaps
the biggest problem with dents is that "<i>it's not BIND</i>" -- and so is not
as trusted as the classic DNS server.
</p>

<p>
<b>Freeze watch</b>: The freeze is just 7 weeks away, if we stick to the
planned schedule. Chris Lawrence posted a 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg00382.html">nice
list</a> of things we need to get done for release, and how close we are
to accomplishing them.
</p>

<p>
With GPG 1.0 released, many people will probably be switching to GPG soon.
Luckily, it turns out to have been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg00123.html">possible
for some time</a> to <b>sign packages with GPG and upload them into Debian</b>,
though few people have done this yet.
</p>

<p>
<b>What do Debian developers do when they're not working on Debian?</b> A lot
of them write software for linux in general, or are the upstream maintainers of
existing software. Martin Schulze had the
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-www-9909/msg00004.html">idea</a> that
a list of such work would be nice to have, and 
<a href="mail#1">123 such packages</a> were soon found, including such important
software as ld.so, strace, sysklogd, sysvinit, watchdog, and wvdial.
</p>

<p>
<b>A bit of confusion has emerged recently about the purpose of
security.debian.org.</b> It was originally
<a
href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9908/msg01924.html">intended</a>
to be a way for the security team to quickly get updated packages out without
waiting for the mirrors. But now people want to mirror it! There's also some
disagreement about how long packages should remain on security.debian.org
after they are merged into the distribution proper.
</p>

<p>
As usual,
<a href="http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn090599.html">this
week's Debian-JP news</a> is available.
</p>
