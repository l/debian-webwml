<b>Welcome</b> to the sixth edition of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for
the Debian developer community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian's new Project Leader is Wichert Akkerman</b>. Election results
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-9902/msg00002.html">
here</a>. Congratulations are in order for Wichert, but also thanks to Ian 
Jackson for guiding Debian through the past year, and thanks to all the other
candidates who volunteered for such a demanding job.
</p>

<p>
<b>Progress toward release continues</b>: the number of release critical bugs
is down to 22 as of today. For more up to date info, you can always check
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/report.html">Wichert's
report</a>. <b>Beta CD images of slink</b> are also now 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00289.html">
available</a> as well. Note that all of Debian takes up 4 CD's now.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.netect.com/advisory_0209.html">buffer overflow security
hole</a> that can lead to <b>root access</b> is present in proftpd and
wu-ftpd. The proftpd package in frozen and unstable is already fixed, and
fixed wu-ftpd-academ packages are in Incoming.

currently in second place. Go

<p>
Lars Wirzenius has written up an
<a href="http://www.iki.fi/liw/texts/debian-lessons.html">excellent list</a>
of <b>lessens about project management</b> we've learned developing Debian.
</p>

<p>
Christian Hammers 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00172.html">
proposed</a> the idea of having a <b>simple config file for networking
setup</b>, rather than the current <tt>/etc/init.d/network</tt> script. The
idea was enthusiastically welcomed with lots of people coming forward with 
code and ideas. It looks like a small part of Debian is going to get easier to
set up.
</p>

<p>
Gordan Matzigkeit, Roland McGrath, and grub's author, Erich Boleyn, had a
very fruitful thread going about <b>grub, the Hurd, and Debian</b>. They 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-hurd-9902/msg00003.html">
discussed</a> how to work together and features the Hurd project needs. In
other Hurd news, emacs20 is now available.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debhelper is now in use by 50%</b> of the source packages in Debian.
<a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/stats/">Here</a> is a graph
showing how Debhelper has grown in popularity over the years.

</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Server news</b>
<ul>
<li><b>www.debian.org had some trouble early in the week</b> (or more
accurately part of the network near to it did) and the site was
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-user-9902/msg00581.html">
difficult to reach</a>. Of course, one of the many mirrors can always be used
if you cannot connect to the main server.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to previous news items:
<ul>
<li>Coverage on slashdot of our <b>hunt for a new logo</b> can be found
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/99/02/03/2050245.shtml">here</a> and
current submissions can be found
<a href="http://contest.gimp.org/view.cgi?month=1999-02">here</a>.
There have been
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00408.html">
some complaints</a> about the requirement that logos in the gimp
contest "<i>MUST be manipulated entirely in the GIMP</i>". One problem with
that is the gimp doesn't yet support vector graphics.
</ul>
