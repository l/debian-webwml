Hi,

This is the recent news [8/10/1999 - 8/16/1999] from Debian JP
Project.  The prefix below such as debian-users, debian-devel,
debian-doc and jp-policy indicates debian-{users,devel,doc} and
jp-policy@debian.or.jp respectively.

I prepare working html repository copy on my ISP's.  The URL is the
below.

  http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/

This is not yet official one.  Soon the debian jp official web page
would be prepared.

The below is the w3-dumped one of the above page.

        JP project. He says that the "Social Contract of Debian JP" should

 * [debian-users:17385] Re: Wnn6 from TurboLinux 4 Package
       
    -- Hiromichi Kawachi posted the way to use Wnn6 on Debian. In Japan,
        TurboLinux is the leading Linux commercial distribution, and
        commercial applications tend to support only TurboLinux platform.
        In this mail, he describes the way to create Wnn6 deb package by
        using alien and by modifying the installation script in the
        original archive.

    href [debian-doc: 01176] DJDP translation table (Re: Packaging Manual
    chap.3)
       
    -- Yoshizumi Endo posted the CVS repository of the translation
        dictionary for technical terms. We sometimes need to unify the
        Japanese words when we try to translate English matters.

 * [debian-users:17392] How to Contribute Debian JP Weekly News

        JP Weekly News" in Japanese.

        This is just the copy of my local machine to my ISP's. The

JP Merge Operation (continued)

 * [debian-devel:10066] [PATCH] X-TrueType support
       
    -- Mutsumi Ishikawa posted a patch for X which enables the X-TrueType
        support on Debian. True Type font support is a serious interest for
        us, people using 2 byte character language. We have so many
        characters to develop a new font data from scratch, while various
        TrueType fonts for Japanese (and other 2 byte characters, maybe)
        have already been available both commercially and freely.

 * [debian-devel:10068] Kinput2 in Debian
       
    -- Kinput2 V3 is on Debian for now. Thanks! Kinput2 is kanji input
        server for X11.

 * [debian-devel:10033] Re: Depenency Bugs in Debian Packages (long)
       
    -- Fumitoshi UKAI posted the summary of Dependency BUGs in Debian
        packages related to Debian JP merge packages. He also posted some
        proposals:
           
        ++ manpages-ja(optional) depends on jgroff(extra) ... change
            manpages-ja dependency to extra would be better solution.
        ++ watanabe-vfont has been rejected by copyright problem but
            vflib2 still depends on it.
        ++ locale-ja extra -> optional
        ++ semi1.12, wemi1.12 is on incoming also available from
            deb http://www.debian.gr.jp/~kitame/debs/ ./

 * [debian-devel:10048] Re: sdic-gene95/edict
       
    -- Takao Kawamura put sdic/Perl5 on Incoming of Debian.org. If you
        can't wait, it will also be available from:
        ftp://ftp.keisanA.ike.tottori-u.ac.jp/pub/local/debian/sdic/
