<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to the 31st issue of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter
for the Debian developer community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="award"></a>
<b>LinuxWorld Expo</b> was the big event of the week. <b>Debian received
a Visitors' Choice award</b> for Best Client Distribution. Debian was also
a finalist in the Editors' Choice awards for Best Web Server, Best Mail 
Server and overall Best Server Distribution.
<b>Expo pictures are also

</p>

<p>
Also at LinuxWorld Expo, <b>Corel demoed their Corel Linux Distribution, based
on Debian</b>. It includes a graphical 4 question install process, and also
has a apt frontend that uses QT, which can be seen 
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/linuxworldtoday/lwt-news2.html">
here</a>. Many people have <b>criticized Debian for being difficult to
install</b>. Christopher W. Curtis started a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00847.html">discussion</a>
on how the Corel Debian installer can make things easier for the new user.
</p>

<p>
<b>A warning to people upgrading from slink to potato</b>: a dependency 
problem was 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00611.html">discovered</a>
in the bash package that would <b>cause bash to be removed</b> from your
system when you upgrade. A fixed bash package has already been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00774.html">
uploaded</a>.
</p>

<p>
Joey Hess <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00604.html">
proposed</a> a <b>major update to slink (Debian 2.1)</b>. Under the proposal,
major packages that have been tested for 2-4 months will be incoporated into
slink. Hopefully, this experiment will help cut down on Debian's future
release cycles. Response so far as been largely positive, and work is
underway.
</p>

<p>
<b>Freeze watch:</b> the latest 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9908/msg00010.html">BugScan
report</a> from Wichert Akkerman shows <b>208 release-critical
bugs</b> in potato.  Several developers have carefully gone through
the report and identified possible solutions for many of the bugs. A
bug-squatter team is needed to fix remaining release critical bugs
after the freeze. Please <a href="mailto:dark@xs4all.nl">contact our
release manager</a> if you are willing to volunteer.
</p>

<p>
As usual, a summary of news from the Debian-JP project is
<a href="mail#1">available</a>.
