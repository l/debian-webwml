#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="November 2nd, 1999" SUMMARY="Freeze postponed for months; a new version of policy; OpenSSH arrives."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Bad news: the freeze has been pushed back all the way to mid-January. The
main problem is the boot floppies, which probably won't be ready until then
(oaeme0z9h5.fsf_-_@burrito.onshore.com).
Read Richard Braakman's mail (19991107131936.A1352@xs4all.nl) for his
other reasons for delaying the freeze. According to Richard, the best way to
help with the release at this point is to work on the boot floppies. Perhaps
the second best thing people can do to help is to avoid making any major
changes to unstable, even though we arn't formally frozen -- "<i>don't start
anything that you can't finish</i>" before the new freeze date.
</p>

<p>
Few people are happy with this postponment of the freeze, and lots of ideas
have been floated, including a the idea of having a partial freeze
(19991109072323.A14760@ormond.unimelb.edu.au), and a resurgence of stable
update (873dui56mi.fsf_-_@raven.localnet) proposal. Some kind of update needs
to be made before next year, since stable has a few 
<a href="../../../y2k/">known Y2K problems</a>.
</p>

<p>
A new version of policy has been released, and it potentially affects every
package in Debian. The major changes are a final word on the /usr/share/doc
issue, and the introduction of build dependencies. Other changes include
FHS 2.1 (reverts /var/state to /var/lib), the deprecation of /etc/rc.boot,
a MIME subpolicy, mailbox locking updates, and the conversion of HTML
changelogs to plain text format. (E11jXAZ-0003Ws-00@polya)
</p>

<p>
Another package becomes free: OpenSSH has replaced
(87g0yob6u3.fsf@sheikh.hands.com) the non-free version of ssh in Debian.
There are a few known problems (19991103184534.B30380@vip.net.pl) with it,
so those who need a stable ssh might want to install the ssh-nonfree package
for now. Oddly enough, this change upset several people *** TODO: tone down,
tell their side ***
(19991106205957.A2329@glitch.snoozer.net).
</p>

<p>
The size of Incoming has been a common concern this week, with many people
worrying what happens to packages that are still stuck there
when we freeze. (19991106154557S.kmuto@topstudio.co.jp)
Incoming peaked at around 800 MB last week, though thanks to the hard work
of the ftp admins, it is now under 400 MB and has only 140 .changes files
in it.  ******* TODO: get latest figures ****** Since two new members
(BMwc5.A.ToB.c32J4@murphy) have just been added to the archive maintenance
team, now five strong, with any luck this problem won't resurface when we
finally do freeze.
</p>

<p>
A quick look at other things going on this week: Randolph Chung is looking
at starting work on a task selection GUI (19991107002354.Q7475@tausq.org).
Netstd was broken up into several smaller packages, which is causing
unanticipated problems (19991105212147.A10402@x8b4e53cd.dhcp.okstate.edu),
October GNOME has been <a href="mail#1">backported to slink</a>, Martin
Schulze posted a HOTWO to follow if you want to create a new Debian mailing
list (19991108140350.F9767@finlandia.infodrom.north.de), and eBay is now 
using Debian (199911081235.NAA24858@bernin.grnbl_domain).
