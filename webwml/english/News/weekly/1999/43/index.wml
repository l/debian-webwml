<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
A new version of policy has been released, and it potentially affects every
package in Debian. The major changes are a final word on the /usr/share/doc
issue, and the introduction of build dependancies. Other changes include
FHS 2.1 (reverts /var/state to /var/lib), the deprecation of /etc/rc.boot,
a MIME subpolicy, mailbox locking updates, and the conversion of HTML
changelogs to plain text format. (E11jXAZ-0003Ws-00@polya)

Another non-free package becomes free: OpenSSH has replaced
(87g0yob6u3.fsf@sheikh.hands.com) the non-free version of ssh in Debian.
There are a few known problems (19991103184534.B30380@vip.net.pl) with it,
so those who need a stable ssh might want to install the ssh-nonfree package
for now. Oddly enough, this change upset several people
(19991106205957.A2329@glitch.snoozer.net).

Many people have been concerned this last week before the freeze about the
size of Incoming, and what happens to packages that are still stuck there
when we freeze. (19991106154557S.kmuto@topstudio.co.jp) Incoming is
currently 475 MB in size ******* TODO: get latest figures ******, down from
a high earlier this week of 800 MB, and the ftp admins are working on
processing the packages that remain there. But there are still a lot of
packages that have been trapped in Incoming (19991104134019.S19976@kitenet.net)
since early September. It seems unfair to not let those package in to
frozen, but is doing so really a good idea? Richard Braakman thinks not
(19991102233659.A4879@xs4all.nl):
<i>"I do not think it is wise to install a hundred new packages just before
the freeze! My plan is to handle all the packages that fix bugs, and
leave the rest for the new unstable."</i> *((* TODO: shorten *****
</p>

<p>
A quick look at other things going on this week: Randolph Chung is looking
at starting work on a task selection GUI (19991107002354.Q7475@tausq.org).
Netstd was broken up into several smaller packages, which is causing
unanticipated problems (19991105212147.A10402@x8b4e53cd.dhcp.okstate.edu).
