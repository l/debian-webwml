#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="November 2nd, 1999" SUMMARY="Freeze postponed for months; a new version of policy; OpenSSH is here."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Bad news -- the freeze has been pushed back all the way to mid-January. The
main problem is the boot floppies, which probably won't be ready until then.
Read Richard Braakman's mail (19991107131936.A1352@xs4all.nl) for his
other reasons for delaying the freeze. According to Richard, the best way to
help with the release at this point is to work on the boot floppies. Few
people are happy with this postponment of the freeze, and lots of ideas have
been floated, including a the idea of having a partial freeze
(19991109072323.A14760@ormond.unimelb.edu.au), and a resurgence of stable
update (873dui56mi.fsf_-_@raven.localnet) proposal. Some kind of update needs
to be made before next year, since stable has a few 
<a href="../../../y2k/">known Y2K problems</a>.
</p>

<p>
A new version of policy has been released, and it potentially affects every
package in Debian. The major changes are a final word on the /usr/share/doc
issue, and the introduction of build dependancies. Other changes include
FHS 2.1 (reverts /var/state to /var/lib), the deprecation of /etc/rc.boot,
a MIME subpolicy, mailbox locking updates, and the conversion of HTML
changelogs to plain text format. (E11jXAZ-0003Ws-00@polya)
</p>

<p>
Another non-free package becomes free: OpenSSH has replaced
(87g0yob6u3.fsf@sheikh.hands.com) the non-free version of ssh in Debian.
There are a few known problems (19991103184534.B30380@vip.net.pl) with it,
so those who need a stable ssh might want to install the ssh-nonfree package
for now. Oddly enough, this change upset several people
(19991106205957.A2329@glitch.snoozer.net).
</p>

<p>
********* TODO: we're not freezing, reqrite *******
Many people have been concerned this last week before the freeze about the
size of Incoming, and what happens to packages that are still stuck there
when we freeze. (19991106154557S.kmuto@topstudio.co.jp) Incoming is
currently 475 MB in size ******* TODO: get latest figures ******, down from
a high earlier this week of 800 MB, and the ftp admins are working on
processing the packages that remain there. But there are still a lot of
packages that have been trapped in Incoming (19991104134019.S19976@kitenet.net)
since early September. It seems unfair to not let those package in to
frozen, but is doing so really a good idea? Richard Braakman thinks not
(19991102233659.A4879@xs4all.nl):
<i>"I do not think it is wise to install a hundred new packages just before
the freeze! My plan is to handle all the packages that fix bugs, and
leave the rest for the new unstable."</i> **** TODO: shorten *****
</p>

<p>
A quick look at other things going on this week: Randolph Chung is looking
at starting work on a task selection GUI (19991107002354.Q7475@tausq.org).
Netstd was broken up into several smaller packages, which is causing
unanticipated problems (19991105212147.A10402@x8b4e53cd.dhcp.okstate.edu),
October GNOME has been <a href="mail#1">backported to slink</a>, Martin
Schulze posted a HOTWO to follow if you want to create a new Debian mailing
list (19991108140350.F9767@finlandia.infodrom.north.de), and eBay is using
Debian (199911081235.NAA24858@bernin.grnbl_domain).
