<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
A new version of policy has been released, and it potentially affects every
package in Debian. The major changes are a final word on the /usr/share/doc
issue, and the introduction of build dependancies. Other changes include
FHS 2.1 (reverts /var/state to /var/lib), the deprecation of /etc/rc.boot,
a MIME subpolicy, mailbox locking updates, and the conversion of HTML
changelogs to plain text format. (E11jXAZ-0003Ws-00@polya)

<p>
Another non-free package becomes free: OpenSSH has replaced
(87g0yob6u3.fsf@sheikh.hands.com) the non-free version of ssh in Debian.
There are a few known problems (19991103184534.B30380@vip.net.pl) with it,
so those who need a stable ssh might want to install the ssh-nonfree package
for now.
