#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="1999-10-26" SUMMARY="The size of Debian a concern; package pools."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. With the freeze date quickly approaching, things are heating up
this week.
</p>

<p>
<b>On the 30th a BugSquash party will be held</b>, in which as many developers
as possible will work on fixing many release critical bugs. Coordination will
be via IRC. Previous BugSquash parties have been successful at fixing lots
of bugs; if you have free time this weekend your 
<a href="mail#mail1">participation</a> is encouraged.
</p>

<p>
<b>The size of Debian continues to be a concern this week.</b> Potato is too
big to fit on two CD's of binary packages, and 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01297.html">almost</a>
everyone feels Debian is becoming unwieldy. The 47MB package mentioned last
week was removed from the archive at the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01242.html">request</a>
of its maintainer, and other removals are being considered.
</p>

<p>
<b>Work on the boot floppies continues</b> on many fronts, including 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01245.html">hardware 
autodetection</a>, work on 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9910/msg00640.html">busybox</a>,
and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9910/msg00532.html">\
discussions</a> of how to make them use an initrd.
</p>

<p>
<b>The dpkg bug list is now smaller and more organized.</b>
Dpkg has <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/dpkg">less than 200 bugs</a> now.
This amazing feat (dpkg used to have 500+ bugs) is the result of lots of
work on dpkg, as well as a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/dpkg-iwj">new
section</a> in the BTS for upstream dpkg bugs.
</p>

<p>
<b>A belated security note</b>: A fixed apmd package was 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-changes-9910/msg00035.html">\
released</a> into stable last week. It closes a buffer overflow security hole.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you represent Debian in any way</b> Wichert wants to hear from you.
He's <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01449.html">\
compiling a list</a> of people who represent Debian in LPI, LSB, etc, to make
it public on the web.
</p>

<p>
Lalo Martins made a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9910/msg00052.html">\
proposal</a> to <b>make Debian use package pools starting as soon as potato is
frozen</b>. He intends to call for a vote in two weeks. Package pools have been
frequently discussed in the past, but no action has ever been taken to
implement them; perhaps this will start the ball rolling, though it might be
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9910/msg00070.html">\
difficult</a> to implement everything in time. Anthony Towns posted a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9910/msg00060.html">\
counterproposal</a> that has many of the nice features of package pools
without requiring any major changes to the archive.
</p>

<p>

<a href="http://www.debian.or.jp/News/weekly/current/issue/">available</a>.
