<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
With the freeze date quickly approaching, things are heating up this week.
On the 30th a BugSquash party will be held, in which as many developers as
possible will work on closing many release critical bugs. Coordination will
be via IRC. Previous BugSquash parties have been sucessful at closing lots
of bugs, if you have free time this weekend your participation is encouraged.

Work on the boot floppies continues, on many fronts, including hardware
autodetection (oa7lkjly0l.fsf@burrito.onshore.com), work on busybox
(19991020234505.F1215@blood-axp.eradicator.org), and discussions of how 
to make them use an initrd (19991019164023.Y747@ipe.uni-stuttgart.de). 
</p>

<p>
Dpkg has <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/dpkg">less than 200 bugs</a> now.
This amazing feat (dpkg used to have 500+ bugs) is the result of lots of
work on dpkg, as well as a <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/dpkg-iwj">new
section</a> in the BTS for upstream dpkg bugs. So the dpkg bug list is
smaller and more organized.
</p>

<p>
A belated security note: A fixed apmd package was released into stable
last week (E11dfCc-0005nU-00@alf.toecompst.nl). It closes a buffer overflow
security hole.

<b>If you represent Debian in any way</b>, Wichert wants to hear from you.
He's compiling a list of people who represent Debian in LPI, LSB, etc, to
make it public on the web. (19991021170610.A11682@liacs.nl)

Lalo Martins posted (19991008043516.A1656@webcom.com) a proposal to make
Debian use package pools starting as soon as potato is frozen. He intends to
call for a vote in two weeks. Package pools have been frequently discussed
in the past, but no action has ever been taken to implement them; perhaps
this will start the ball rolling, though it might be difficult
(Pine.LNX.3.96.991025000247.1037K-100000@localhost) to implement everything
in time. Anthony Towns posted a counterproposal
(19991025132030.B18562@azure.humbug.org.au) that has many of the nice
features of package pools without requiring any major changes to the archive.

Debian at ALS through the eyes of Branden Robinson filters out some of the
best webcam pictures from ALS with amusing commentary.

enough, here are <a href="http://netgod.net/als/">more pictures</a>.
