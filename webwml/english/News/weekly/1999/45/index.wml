<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Adam Di Carlo reported (oaln7we35p.fsf@burrito.onshore.com)
on the status of the boot floppies: "<i>we've mostly
completed shoring up the internals of boot-floppies</i>". With the internals
clened up, the boot-floppies team is ready to work on bugs and todo list
items. Adam also says that "<i>all the major tasks are assigned, and to
capable people</i>" and that the work on the boot floppies is on track to be
"<i>feature complete in early December</i>". The best way to help with the
boot floppies now is to help the team work through
(oayabwcnbl.fsf@burrito.onshore.com) their
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/boot-floppies">bug list</a>, and to help test
the base system (oahfike2v4.fsf@burrito.onshore.com) installed by the boot
floppies. This last can be accomplished easily by unpacking a tarball and
chrooting; no need to reinstall. These are tasks anyone with even a few
hours can help with, and getting a working boot-floppies is the critical
item that needs to be accomplished before our next release.
