<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Adam Di Carlo reported (oaln7we35p.fsf@burrito.onshore.com)
on the status of the boot floppies: "<i>we've mostly
completed shoring up the internals of boot-floppies</i>". With the internals
clened up, the boot-floppies team is ready to work on bugs and todo list
items. Adam also says that "<i>all the major tasks are assigned, and to
capable people</i>" and that the work on the boot floppies is on track to be
"<i>feature complete in early December</i>". The best way to help with the
boot floppies now is to help the team work through
(oayabwcnbl.fsf@burrito.onshore.com) their
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/boot-floppies">bug list</a>, and to help test
the base system (oahfike2v4.fsf@burrito.onshore.com) installed by the boot
floppies. This last can be accomplished easily by unpacking a tarball and
chrooting; no need to reinstall. These are tasks anyone with even a few
hours can help with, and getting a working boot-floppies is the critical
item that needs to be accomplished before our next release.

Guy Maor takes on the package pool. Guy described
(87yabr2e43.fsf@femto.dyn.ml.org) a varient of the package
pool idea, and said he would implement it. This will be a major
restructuring of the Debian archive, and it will add a great deal of
flexability: "<i>creating a new distribution requires writing code which
answers the question, given the available versions of this package, which
one to choose?</i>" The downside is that "<i>mirroring by architecture and
by freeness is still possible, but mirroring by distribution is not possible
without a specialized tool.</i>" Response to Guy's posting was enthusiastic;
maybe the package pool idea will finally become reality.
