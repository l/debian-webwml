Ok, I removed 96 and 97 from the Lists Archives and the size is down to:
1178322 Lists-Archives
The original mboxes that the archives were derived from are in that
directory.  We need to ask Guy to add a section to his
Lists-Archives/index.html file that points to those files, also..
In the mean time, you should all know that they still exist and they're in
that directory.  Naming scheme is basicly &lt;listname&gt;-YYMM.gz

Hi,

This is the recent news [7/12/1999 - 7/17/1999] from Debian JP
Project.  

I will take a few day off [7/18 - 7/21] and it will break the deadline
of Debian Weekly news so I will send my manuscript earlier than 2
days.

* 1FD FTP Server  (debian-users)
  Masaki Ikeda posted the 1FD FTP server installation image.  The URL:
  http://www.lbi.gr.jp/~orange/1fd-ftp/
  (Japanese only)

  It's quite useful if you already have Windows PC and attempt to
  install Debian from Windows PC ftpd.  Usually Windows can't deal
  with the symbolic links correctly so it is difficult.  This 1FD ftp
  server provides the Network ability from desktop PC within 1FD.  The
  kernel is based on 2.2.10 and most of this package is based on
  Debian 2.1.  Note this distribution uses Japanese 106 keyboard and
  only ATAPI CD-ROM supported.  Various network interfaces are included
  though.

* ATOK installer package (debian-users)
  ATOK is the Kana-Kanji converter which is very famous commercial
  software in Japan.  The original program targets Windows PC and
  recently ported to Linux.  Hiroshi Naraki creates installer package
  of this package.

  We Japanese usually input Japanese character like the below.

  Roman character --(convert)--> Hiragana --(convert)--> Kanji
  
  Yeah, it's a little bit complex way to input.  But we have four
  kinds of characters set in one language and it is the way to deal
  with.

* Visualized Release-critical Bugreport for July 16, 1999 (debian-users)
  Ken Nakagaki posted the PS results of the Release-critical bug.  The
  number of the fixed bug is slightly smaller than the number of the
  bugs newly filed.
  
  It is not yet archived.
  &lt;199907161240.VAA13441@lancelot.applause.nu&gt;

* Upload e2ps 4.0-1.3 (debian-devel)
  Atsuhito Kohda uploaded e2ps package.  Changes are on the English
  messages revised on debian-devel@debian.org list.  Thanks a lot!

* man-db i18n patch (debian-devel)
  Yoshiaki Yanagihara is now working on fixing man-db-ja.  It has
  security problem and requires urgent fix.  Later he will work
  man-db i18n patch for Debian.

  http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/199907/msg00094.html

* gs-vflib-ja (debian-devel)
  Taketoshi Sano is now working gs-vflib-ja package to upload to
  Debian for potato.  Vflib is "Vector Font Library" for Japanese
  Character Code.
 
  http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/199907/msg00113.html

* /usr/share/doc? (debian-devel)
  dh_installdocs -> /usr/doc
  dh_dhelp -> /usr/share/doc
  How can we treat them?

I'm not one to look a gift horse in the mouth - if you don't want
yours, I'll take them;->

Hi,

is it only me, or did you also get this spam from Red Hat about stock
options?

Oh man - the bigger the company, the less clueful people?
