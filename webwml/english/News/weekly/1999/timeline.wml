<p>
<b>This special supplement to Debian Weekly News is a review of 
the most important happenings of 1999 in the Debian world.</b> This is
certainly not a comprehensive list. The focus is on unusual and notable
events, not the continual background development activity and discussions.
</p>

<p>
<b>To give some idea of the sheer volume of what has gone on behind the
scenes this year, 
a few numbers:</b> 22 thousand bug reports were filed this year,
while 170 thousand messages were posted to the various Debian
mailing lists and nearly 25 thousand new versions of packages were uploaded.
</p>

<p>
Here are the most memorable events of 1999 in the Debian Project: 
</p>

<p>
<b>January</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We've made one major release of Debian this past year and are rapidly
approaching another freeze. At this time last year, deep in the interminable
freeze for Debian 2.1, we were beginning to wonder if the freeze would ever
end, and we were having some <a href="1/#skip_slink">second thoughts</a>
about our plans for the release. We kept on working though, going into a deep
freeze in late January.
<li>
For the first time a minimal Debian GNU/Hurd system <a href="2/#hurd">was
available</a>, based on the Debian base system.
<li>
The <a href="2/#build_deps">first tentative work</a> began on support for build
dependencies in source packages. (At that time we called them "source
dependencies".)
<li>
Elections <a href="3/#elections">started</a> for the new Debian Project Leader.
This was the first time we chose a leader in this way, and it was an exciting
process that happily didn't become too political.
<li>
The temporary license on the old Debian logo <a href="4/#debianlogo">expired</a>
for the <i>n</i>th time. We began discussing what new license we should use,
and also decided to look for a new logo via a Gimp logo contest.
</ul>

<p>
<b>February</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dpkg development, long stalled, <a href="5/#dpkg">resumed</a>, with some nice
new features added: automatic upload announcements and automatic bug closing
enabled when packages are uploaded. Several people promised to do some more 
work on dpkg soon, and dpkg did become much more maintained this year than
it had been in the past.
<li>
Wichert Akkerman was <a href="6/#leader">elected</a> Debian's new leader.
<li>
Use of debhelper hit the <a href="6/#debhelper">50% mark</a>.
<li>
Work on the release continued, and a release date of March 2nd
<a href="7/#release">was set</a>.
<li>
The idea of a version of Debian based on FreeBSD was
<a href="8/#freebsd">raised</a> for the first time.
</ul>

<p>
<b>March</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The release was <a href="9/#delay">delayed for a week</a>. Some last minute
confusion ensued as people didn't hear about the delay in time, and a party on
IRC celebrated the release prematurely. In the rocky last few days before the
release, tensions rose, and some unfortunate incidents made Brian White resign
from being Release Manager (Richard Braakman later took over the job). 
Finally, on March 9th, Debian 2.1 was <a href="10/#release">released</a>.
<li>
The Gimp logo contest <a href="9/#debianlogo">ended</a>, having generated several
nice candidate logos, and we prepared to vote on the logo, while still trying
to decide what license to use for it.
<li>
Debian was <a href="10/#empeg">used in the Empeg</a> in-car mp3 player.
<li>
With Debian released, <a href="11/#development">another round of development
began</a>. The first major task was migrating to glibc 2.1.
</ul>

<p>
<b>April</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
We began considering the idea of having <a href="14/#debianlogo">two logos</a>: one
for official and one for liberal use. Voting on the number of logos and their
licenses eventually <a href="16/#debianlogo">started</a>.
<li>
Corel <a href="17/#corel">announced plans</a> to create a Linux distribution
based on Debian.
<li>
The Bug Tracking System <a href="17/#bts">went down</a> when an ancient a.out
binary in it broke. This served as a wake up call about how unmaintained the
Bug Tracking System was. In September, after a lot of work, the BTS was
<a href="35/#bts">updated</a> to use the new debbugs package.
</ul>

<p>
<b>May</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The <a href="18/#debianlogo">results</a> of the logo license vote came in: we
decided to have two logos with different licenses. By the end of the month,
voting on the actual logo was <a href="21/#debianlogo">underway</a>.
<li>
Discussion on the debian-policy mailing list became more active, and 
<a href="19/#policy">weekly policy summaries</a> started to be posted.
<li>
The <a href="19/#jp">Debian JP project</a> released a Japanese version of slink
and indicated they wanted to become part of Debian proper and merge the
changes into Debian. Several people from Debian JP became Debian developers,
and started <a href="21/#jp">adding packages to Debian</a>.
<li>
A <a href="19/#non-us">new server</a> for non-us was put up, ending the long
chain of problems with the old server. At the same time, non-us was
reorganized to more closely match the layout of the rest of Debian.
</ul>

<p>
<b>June</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The "swirl" became the <a href="23/#debianlogo">new Debian logo</a> and was rapidly
adopted by the Debian community. But the logo votes weren't over yet; a
proposal was made to switch the official and liberal use logos, and the issue
was <a href="25/#debianlogo">brought to a vote</a> in late June.
<li>
SPI became an official US <a href="23/#spi">non-profit</a>.
<li>
A <a href="25/#book">new Debian book</a> titled <i>Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to
Installation and Usage</i> was published, the first of several new Debian
books to appear.
</ul>

<p>
<b>July</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
After a lot of work, perl 5.005 was <a href="26/#perl">introduced</a> into
Debian. The perl upgrade affected a great many packages, and turned out
to be rather painful. Some infrastructure was put in place to make future
perl upgrades easier by letting several versions of perl coexist on a single
system.
<li> 
Another Debian-based distribution called Storm Linux was 
<a href="27/#storm">released</a>.
<li> 
Ending the long logo saga, we voted to <a href="27/#debianlogo">swap</a> the two 
logos. After a contest, lots of discussion, and three votes, this marks the 
end of the logo issue.
<li>
A major new revision of Debian policy was released, mandating FHS compliance.
This <a href="26/#policy">raised the question</a> of how to migrate from
/usr/doc to /usr/share/doc. Several proposals were made and rejected on the
debian-policy list and in what looked like a breakdown of the policy
amendment process, <a href="28/#fhs">no decision</a> could be reached.
After much confusion and some long delays, it was referred to the
newly-created technical committee. Due to further delays, the committee 
did not arrive at a <a href="34/#decision">decision</a> until September.
</ul>

<p>
<b>August</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Debian became 6 years old.
<li>
People started to complain that the new-maintainer queue was
<a href="29/#queue">stuck</a>, and <a href="30/#rumor">rumors</a> began
circulating that Debian had stopped accepting maintainers until potato was
released. Within a few weeks, a mechanism for getting around this had sprung
up, with developers <a href="33/#sponsor">sponsoring</a> uploads by people
stuck in the queue. Later, in October, the closure of the new maintainer
queue <a href="39/#new-maintainer">became official</a>, and a reorganization of
the new maintainer team began. But at year's end, the queue remained closed.
<li>
At Linuxworld Expo, Debian received an <a href="31/#award">award</a> for
"<i>Best Client Distribution</i>" and was a runner-up for 3 other awards.
</ul>

<p>
<b>September</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Gpg 1.0 was released, and Debian hurriedly <a href="34/#gpg">embraced it</a> for
signing packages, finally making it possible to build Debian packages with
entirely free tools.
<li>
Another <a href="29/#book">Debian book</a> called <i>Debian Gnu/Linux 2.2
Unleashed</i> became available, and we learned that O'Reilly also had a Debian
book in the works, to be sold by VA as part of a Debian <a href="39/#book">boxed
set</a>.
<li>
Corel's Debian derivative entered a <a href="36/#corel">closed beta test</a>,
annoying many.
<li>
The developer database <a href="37/#db">went online</a>, containing lots of
information about developers. Nice maps were generated from this, showing
the distribution of developers worldwide.
</ul>

<p>
<b>October</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Adam Di Carlo took over leadership of the boot-floppies team, and work on
the boot floppies <a href="39/#boot_floppies">heated up</a> as we neared a
scheduled freeze date of November first.
<li>
A license incompatibility in Corel's apt frontend was found and
<a href="42/#corel">quickly resolved</a>.
</ul>

<p>
<b>November</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The freeze was postponed first for a week, and then <a href="43/#freeze">until
mid-January</a>. The main problem was the boot floppies, which probably won't
be ready until then. This pleased no-one, especially when we realized that
Debian 2.1 was not yet Y2K safe, and would need to be updated.
<li>
Build dependencies were <a href="43/#build_deps">codified in policy</a>
and started to appear in source packages.
<li>
Corel Linux was released. It received only a <a href="44/#corel">lukewarm
reception</a> from within Debian, but questions about it soon began to appear
on the Debian mailing lists.
<li>
The Bug Tracking system passed the <a href="44/#bts">50,000 bug mark</a>.
<li>
Debian with a FreeBSD kernel <a href="45/#freebsd">came up again</a>, and
received a lot more attention this time, from people in Debian and from
the outside world.
</ul>

<p>
<b>December</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Debian 2.1r4 was <a href="47/#release">released</a>, consisting of y2k fixes
and security updates.
<li>
Ian Murdock (the "Ian" in "Debian"), and Bruce Perens announced
<a href="47/#dpl">Progeny Linux</a>, a forthcoming Debian-based business
and distribution.
<li> 
Debian <a href="48/#lj">won</a> the Linux Journal Readers' Choice award for
Favorite Distribution.
</ul>
