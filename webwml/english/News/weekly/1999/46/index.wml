<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
<b>Corel goofs up again on licencing issues.</b> Corel Linux's 
<a href="http://linux.corel.com/products/linux_os/eula.htm">EULA</a> prohibits
minors -- including the minors who are Debian developers and contributors to
free software -- from downloading or using the Debian-based distribution.
(Bruce Perens, frustrated
(19991126194830.2C3B51FF009@perens.com) at the third Corel licencing mistake
in as many months, called for a lawsuit against Corel
(19991126180900.CF1ED1FF009@perens.com), though he has backed off
(19991126212219.EF0B01FF009@perens.com) on that
idea.) Corel hasn't responded officially yet to this latest issue, though one
of their developers did speak up (383F6830.8247050D@corel.com). ** finish
this up. Note user-friendly cartoon about this exists.
