<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
<b>Corel goofed up again on licencing issues.</b> Corel Linux's <a
href="http://linux.corel.com/products/linux_os/eula.htm">EULA</a> prohibits
minors from downloading or using the Debian-based distribution. Of course,
this is rather absurd, since many Debian developers and other copyright
holders are themselves minors. It is also a violation of the DFSG, and an
unapproved addition to the licenses of Debian. Bruce Perens, frustrated
(19991126194830.2C3B51FF009@perens.com) at the third Corel licencing mistake
in as many months, called for a lawsuit against Corel
(19991126180900.CF1ED1FF009@perens.com). Corel hasn't responded officially
yet to this latest issue, though one of their developers did speak up
(383F6830.8247050D@corel.com). ** finish this up **
