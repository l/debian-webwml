<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Has Corel goofed up again on licensing issues?</b> Corel Linux's 
<a href="http://linux.corel.com/products/linux_os/eula.htm">EULA</a>
prohibits minors -- including minors who are Debian developers and
contributors to free software -- from
<a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/99nov/19991128.html">
downloading</a> the Debian-based distribution. (Bruce Perens,
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9911/msg00227.html">
frustrated</a> at the third Corel licencing issue in as many months,
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/11/28/1113233&amp;mode=nested">
briefly advocated</a> a lawsuit against Corel.) Corel has been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9911/msg00272.html">
talking</a> to Debian about the issue, though people are still
unsatisfied with the results and are getting a bit fed up with these
continuing problems.
</p>

<p>
The idea of <b>an "<i>Enhances</i>" field</b> that is like a reverse Suggests
field has been broached again on debian-policy. Dpkg will support this field
soon, and Wichert Akkerman
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9911/msg00184.html">wants to
use it</a> to make packages in main no longer suggest anything in
non-free, thus satisfying some of RMS's concerns. While most people agree the
Enhances field is a useful new addition, there is disagreement about using it
in the way Wichert is proposing. Some 
<a href="mail#1">feel</a> that doing this would be putting
"<i>political correctness and quick hacks</i>" ahead of doing things right.
</p>

<p>
<b>Should we get rid of the "<i>base</i>" section?</b> It
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00113.html">turns
out</a> that packages in the section aren't automatically put in the base
system on the boot floppies, nor does being in the section seem to affect
things any other way. People agree it would be a lot cleaner to get rid of the
section and put the packages in it in the sections they really belong in. The
discussion
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00115.html">moved
on</a> to a more general discussion of getting rid of all sections and
organizing packages in other ways.
</p>

<p>   
<b>New packages</b> in Debian this week include the following and 18 more: 
</p>
<ul>    
<li><a
href="../../../../Packages/unstable/interpreters/erlang.html">erlang</a>: A
real-time, concurrent and distributed functional language                  
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/flexml">flexml</a>:
Generate fast validating XML processors and applications     
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/math/gsl-bin">gsl-bin</a>:
The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) -- binary package    
(<a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/math/gsl-ref-pdf.html">docs</a>       
<a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/math/libgsl0.html">lib</a>, 
<a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/devel/libgsl0-dev.html">dev</a>)       
</ul>     

<p>
<b>Other things happening this week</b> include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>"<i>Ask the Debian Project Leader</i>" is this week's interview 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/11/29/1131218&amp;mode=nested">on 
Slashdot</a>. Wichert will answer the questions on Friday. 
<li>Ben Collins
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01833.html">posted</a>
<b>a PAM mini-policy</b>. If you want to use PAM in your packages, this is
a must-read.
<li>Debian has gained several machines lately, including a new     
<a href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi?host=rameau">netwinder</a>, and a 
<a href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi?host=lully">loaded alpha</a>. We 
have lots of machines of many architectures available for developers to use, 
all listed <a href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">here</a>.
<li>
It's hard to summarize
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01847.html">this
thread</a> about <b>release critical bugs</b> except to say that tons of people
are working on fixing various release critical bugs and they all spoke up -- a
good thing to see.
</ul>

<p>
I'll conclude with <b>an editorial message to Debian users</b>: A common theme
this week, and indeed for the past several weeks has been annoyance at overuse
of bug severities higher than 'normal'. Messages like
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9911/msg01826.html">this
one</a> are common. The inflation in bug severities seems to have arisen
because bug reporting tools are now making it easy to set higher severities,
and because it is hard to think objectively about a bug that is affecting you
-- most bugs seem important to the person who is tripping over them. Bear in
mind that tagging a bug as 'grave', 'critical', or 'important' does not
necessarily mean it will be fixed sooner; it only means that if it is not
fixed, the package it is in will be removed from Debian. Unless your bug is of
a magnitude to make this necessary, it should be a 'normal' severity bug. If
you are unsure, it is better to file a 'normal' severity bug and let the
maintainer decide if a higher severity is necessary. Thanks.
