#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="December 7th, 1999" SUMMARY="A quiet weekl Y2K fix subrelease coming soon; follwups to last week"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. It's been a relatively quiet week and there is little to report on.
</p>

<p>
Debian 2.1r4 is due to be released by Sunday. It consits of equal parts y2k
fixes and security fixes. Vincent Renardias posted a last call
(Pine.LNX.4.20.9912071737540.26135-200000@v2.ldsol.com) for people
to help compile things for non-i386 architectures to go in the new release.
</p>

<p>
Debian Project Leader elections are due to start now, but rather than have
them run over the holiday season, the Project Secretary is planning to put
them off until Janurary. The plan is that nominations will begin January
9th. (19991211174403.G7781@benham.net)

reviewed Debian's install process</a>: "<i>Debian's installation is the most
confusing one we encountered. It requires that you understand technical jargon
such as 'root filesystem' and 'non-free'</i>".
</p>

<p>
New versions of <a href="../../../../security/1999/19991202">dump</a>,
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991207">sendmail</a>
and htdig (handler.52221.B52221.944688008819@bugs.debian.org) have been
released, fixing security holes in those packages.
</p>

<p>
Jason Gunthorpe posted about how to use the email gateway to the developer
database. The email gateway
(Pine.LNX.3.96.991210214242.27908B-100000@wakko.deltatee.com) allows
setting of a few things, like ssh authorized keys and debian.net DNS entries,
that cannot be changed via the
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">web interface</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>What are all these Debian leaders up to?</b>
Debian founder Ian Murdock (with investment help from Bruce Perens) is
starting a <a href="http://linuxvc.com/Articles/Investments">Debian-based
business</a> called "Progeny Linux". It will "<i>produce a commercial
derivation of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution for the scientific and
technical markets</i>" and aims to "<i>show other commercial Linux
distributions by example how to succeed while continuing to be good citizens
of the Open Source community</i>" Ian is also a member of Bruce's
<a href="http://linuxvc.com/">Linux Capital Group</a>, which incidentially
now has Wichert Akkerman on its 
<a href="http://linuxvc.com/Articles/AdvisoryBoard">advisory board</a>.
</p>

<p>
Followups to last week's news:
<ul>
<li><b>Wichert's     
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/12/03/099221&mode=nested"> 
Slashdot interview</a></b> answers some common questions, and includes some 
things that might be news to developers as well: "<i>What we plan to do for 
potato once it is released is create update-packs on a regular basis. An 
update-pack is a set of packages that you can install on top of stable and 
extend or upgrade it in some way. Examples could be a Y2K pack, a GNOME pack 
or a KDE pack.</i>"
<li>Corel's lawyers posted a response (3846D925.7DAC5D58@corel.ca) to the
EULA problem.
</ul>
