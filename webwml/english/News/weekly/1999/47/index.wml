<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. It's been a relatively quiet week and there is little to report on.
</p>

<p>
Debian 2.1r4 is due to be released by Sunday. It consits of equal parts y2k
fixes and security fixes. Vincent Renardias posted a last call
(Pine.LNX.4.20.9912071737540.26135-200000@v2.ldsol.com) for people
to help compile things for non-i386 architectures to go in the new release.
</p>

<p>
A new version of dump has been released, fixing a security hole.

Followups to last week's news:
<ul>
<li><b>Wichert's     
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/12/03/099221&mode=nested"> 
Slashdot interview</a></b> answers some common questions, and includes some 
things that might be news to developers as well: "<i>What we plan to do for 
potato once it is released is create update-packs on a regular basis. An 
update-pack is a set of packages that you can install on top of stable and 
extend or upgrade it in some way. Examples could be a Y2K pack, a GNOME pack 
or a KDE pack.</i>"
<li>Corel's lawyers posted a response (3846D925.7DAC5D58@corel.ca) to the
EULA problem.
