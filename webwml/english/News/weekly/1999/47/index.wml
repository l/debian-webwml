<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This edition covers two weeks of news, since there wasn't enough
of interest last week to make a full issue of DWN.
</p>

<p>
<a name="release"></a>
<b>Debian 2.1r4 has been released.</b> A recommended upgrade for anyone using
stable, it consists of
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/ChangeLog">equal parts y2k
fixes and security fixes</a> Getting this out in time has been a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-9912/msg00040.html">last
minute scramble</a>, and the people who put in long hours this
weekend should be commended. It seems likely that a few more y2k issues will
crop up in the weeks ahead -- for example a fix for a y2k problem in nethack
was only <a href="http://www.nethack.org/">fixed upstream</a>
a few days ago, and did not make it into the release.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes</b> have been released for 
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991202">dump</a>, 
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991207">sendmail</a> and 
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991209">htdig</a>. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian Project Leader elections</b> are due to start now, but rather than
have them run over the holiday season the Project Secretary is planning to
put them off until January. 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9912/msg00003.html">
The plan</a> is to begin nominations on January 9th. January is shaping up
to be a busy month -- remember that the freeze is scheduled for January
15th, just one month from today.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Towns has
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9912/msg00031.html">set
up</a> a <b>"<i>testing</i>" distribution</b> on
<a href="../../oldurl?http://lully.debian.org/~ajt/debian/dists/testing/">
lully.debian.org</a>. This distribution is meant to be somewhere in between
stable and unstable. Anthony's code makes sure that upgrading packages
in testing does not cause any dependancy problems. It also only moves
packages into testing once they have been around for two weeks and have
presumably been found to be bug-free. This has potential to become a useful
distribution for people who want the cutting-edge power of unstable without
the bugs.

<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg00627.html">posted</a>
about how to use the <b>email gateway to the developer database</b>. The email
gateway allows setting of a few things, like ssh authorized keys and debian.net
DNS entries, that cannot be changed via the
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">web interface</a>.

<b>What are all these Debian leaders up to?</b>
Debian founder Ian Murdock (with investment help from Bruce Perens) is
starting a <a href="http://linuxvc.com/Articles/Investments">Debian-based
business</a> called "Progeny Linux". It will "<i>produce a commercial
derivation of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution for the scientific and
technical markets</i>" and aims to "<i>show other commercial Linux
distributions by example how to succeed while continuing to be good citizens
of the Open Source community</i>" Ian is also a member of Bruce's
<a href="http://linuxvc.com/">Linux Capital Group</a>, which incidentally
now has Wichert Akkerman on its 
<a href="http://linuxvc.com/Articles/AdvisoryBoard">advisory board</a>.
</p>

<p>
Followups to previous news items:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Wichert's     
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/12/03/099221&amp;mode=nested"> 
Slashdot interview</a></b> answers some common questions, and includes some 
things that might be news to developers as well: "<i>What we plan to do for 
potato once it is released is create update-packs on a regular basis. An 
update-pack is a set of packages that you can install on top of stable and 
extend or upgrade it in some way. Examples could be a Y2K pack, a GNOME pack 
or a KDE pack.</i>"
<li>Corel's lawyers
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-9912/msg00051.html">posted
a response</a> to the EULA problem. They maintain that the EULA is necessary
to ensure that the GPL can be enforced.
</ul>
