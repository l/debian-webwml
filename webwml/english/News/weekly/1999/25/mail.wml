Hi folks,

        At long last, I have created a new policy version, the one
 that is destined to be version 3.0.0.0. As promised, I am not
 uploading this package, but presenting it here in order that people
 have a first look at it and make sure I have not made major
 mistakes. http://www.debian.org/%7Esrivasta/

This is the recent news [6/22/1999 - 6/28/1999] from Debian JP
Project.

* Bug stamp-out list plotter (debian-users)
Ken Nakagaki posted a Perl script to visualize the critical buglist
submitted by Wichert.  It plots the below lists:
	* New BUG cumulative number
	* Modified BUG cumulative number
	* Not-modified and remain BUG number
	* The all release critical BUG number
	* All BUG cumulative number

(The script)
http://lists.debian.org/debian-users/199906/msg00584.html

(The PS gzipped results)
http://lists.debian.org/debian-users/199906/msg00696.html

* merge xfree86-xtt (debian-devel)
Mutsumi Ishikawa proposed the scheme for merging xtt to potato.

http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/199906/msg00317.html

* file-kanji and file2 (debian-devel)
 The discussion of the alignment between Debian JP packages and Debian
packages.  For example, Debian JP once had a package called file2, and
when it was uploaded to Debian, its name was changed to file-kanji.
So now we have the very same packages except their names.

 Can we write like the below?

Conflicts: file2
Replaces: file2

Note file2 appears only in Debian JP, not in Debian.

Can't we set the dependency on the packages which are not in Debian
but in Debian JP?

http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/199906/msg00342.html

*  Applying newer license to older vim (debian-devel)
Taketoshi Sano confirmed the vim 3.0 license (jvim is based on vim 3.0
for present).  Backward compatibility of the license is agreed with vim
author and Sano-san will upload new license jvim to Debian. 

http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/199906/msg00348.html

*  Package description translation (debian-doc)
Japanese translation of Package description is now ongoing.
&lt;v04010101b39b3d2f6fec@a2.mbn.or.jp&gt;

* Debian developers Reference translation (debian-doc)
Yoshizumi Endo expresses the will to translation.

Thanks a lot for the below contribution from Debian JP project:
