Subject: Release Plans (1999-05-10)
To: debian-devel-announce@lists.debian.org
Date: Mon, 10 May 1999 19:06:58 +0200 (CEST)
From: Richard Braakman &lt;dark@xs4all.nl&gt;

(Please send followups to debian-devel, not debian-devel-announce.)

This mail is a summary of issues that affect the next release.  Comments
and feedback are welcome.  It's supposed to be a complete list, so please
contact me if your favourite issue is not listed here.

I realize that I have, so far, not acted as Release Manager in the way
I intended.  I apologize for this, and I promise to do better from now on.

A number of release goals have been proposed.  I don't intend to start
the freeze until all release goals are in place.

  * No release-critical bugs.
Wichert's list shows more than 100 of these.  I'll go through it soon,
and probably downgrade a number of them, and mark some packages for
removal when the Time Comes.  (I'll ask Wichert to count those
separately).  Still, it's going to take some time to fix them all,
and this will probably be the main factor in setting the freeze date.

  * Working disk sets for all released architectures.
I don't know much about the plans for the boot-floppies yet.  Could
someone volunteer as a contact person, or tell me the best list to read?

  * glibc 2.1 upgrade
As far as I know, this project is largely complete.  There are one or two
bugs left in the backward compatibility code, and there's the question
of what to do with /dev/pts.

  * glibc 2.1 source compatibility
A larger task is to ensure that all packages still compile on a glibc
2.1 development system.  The sparc people may have a list of problem
packages.

  * PAM
Progress has been made toward a fully PAMified system, with X and
the shadow suite being the main exceptions.  I don't intend to
delay the release for this, but I think it has a good chance of
being completed in time anyway.

  * perl 5.005
I've been assured that a working upgrade plan now exists and is being
worked on, one that will not involve recompiling a lot of packages.
I'll still be happier if perl 5.005 is introduced at the start of
the next release cycle, though.  There's a lot of perl code in Debian
that hasn't been tested with the new version.

  * FHS compliance
This will involve a number of changes that will affect all packages.
There's no consensus yet on how to do this, and I consider it to be
still in the "early plans" stage.  In the meantime, we've been moving
toward FHS compatibility in little ways.

  * GNOME
I wasn't there to see it, but I hear that the GNOME staging area has
now been folded into potato and is ready for the freeze.

  Timescale:
The freeze is at least one month away, and possibly a lot more than
that.  I'm not going to set a date until the number of
release-critical bugs has been reduced considerably.

  debian-release mailing list:
I think this is a good idea, and I will certainly join such a list.

  Return of the Revenge of Slink:
A Debian 2.1r3 release should be made soon, to fix a number of 
outstanding bugs.  I'll write a separate mail about this.

  Potato Architectures:
As far as I know it will be the same set as in slink, i.e. i386, m68k,
sparc, and alpha.  If any other architectures want to make a release
they will have to decide soon.

  Help wanted:
I'd like someone in charge of chasing release-critical bugs.  This
means mailing maintainers to ask for plans and estimated fix times,
adding comments to Wichert's bugscan list, and telling me which bugs
are probably bogus.

I have heard that some self-candidates from Debian JP felt
that the Debian Project rejects them as a maintainer, 
because:

one of them had not receive no answers for long time,

   more than a month is too long enough for ordinary people.

one of them did not have no English-written certificate,

   He was a high school student at that time, and did not have 
   the passport. He can not get Driver's License since the laws
   in Japan prohibit those under 18-years-old to get the license,
   as well as many high school in Japan also prohibit their student 
   to get the license as the school rules. 
   (In fact, the Driver's License itself is no-use because
    that is all written in Japanese, so the required is not only
    the license itself, but also International License with extra fee.)
   He got the chance to meet fellow Debian maintainers face to face
   after all, but it takes some extra period and effort unnecessary.

and one of them had not enough time to wait the oversea call at home.

   He worked at laboratory, and during the experimentation, 
   he can't respond any call. The experimentation sometimes continues
   all over the night. He can make time to debianize some software
   and he already uploads some interesting packages to Debian JP, 
   but he can't upload to Debian now although he himself wishes to do it.
   He wishes that let him know at least the time of calling in advance,
   so he can prepare to respond the call. Currently, nothing is to be
   known when the telephone rings, even at day, night, or midnight.

   "developers-reference" told us 

       A phone number where we can call you. Remember that 
       the new maintainer team usually calls during
       evening hours to save on long distance tolls. 
       Please do not give a work number, unless you are generally
       there in the evening. 

   but When is the "evening hours" ? or Where this "the evening hours"
   have meaning at ? We don't know where the person at new-maintainer
   lives in. If he lives in, say, NewYork city, "the evening hours"
   may be 17:00-21:00 there, and 07:00-11:00 morning here. 
   Without the announce in advance, those who lives in Japan have 
   some difficulty to continue to wait a telephone call hopelessly 
   for a few months at such working time.

Some days ago, the dispute arose on Debian JP project, 
about the release of next JP Packages. We think that the JP Packages
should (at least) be slim as much as we can, and our goal is 
the abolishment of JP Packages (all JP Pacakges either go into
Debian or get being unnecessary, that means we do not require 
the separate localized packages to handle with our language).

Some members including current Debian maintainers (whom we call
as "official maintainers") insist that the action should have
taken now to speed up the contribution of JP packages into Debian.

The proposed action is to make an explicitly declaration that
"official" maintainers can freely take and move the JP packages
debianized by non "official" maintainers.

Why is this needed ? There is a barrier or filter to be a maintainer
on Debian currently, and it is easy to take and move than to wait
patiently the willing JP member to be registered as a maintainer.

BTW, related to that dispute, an "official" maitainer said 
the "filter" works effectively. Is this the common idea to 
Debian people ? Does Debian needs the filter to trap and drop 
the willing self-candidate who have made and maitained 
a qualified package already ?

"developers-reference" told us:

  The process of registering as a developer is a process of 
  verifying your identity and intentions. As the number
  of people working on Debian GNU/Linux has grown to over 400 people 
  and our systems are used in several very important places we have to 
  be careful about being compromised. Therefore, we need to verify new
  maintainers before we can give them accounts on our servers and 
  letting them upload packages. 

I understand (or at least hope to understand) this and I think also 
some verification mechanism is required. But I doubt the enoughness
and effectiveness of the current processing mechanism.

"developers-reference" told us also:

  Once this information is received and processed, you should be 
  contacted with information about your new Debian maintainer account. 
  If you don't hear anything within 7-14 days, please send a followup 
  message asking if your original application was received. 
  Do not re-send your original application, that will just confuse the
  new-maintainer team. Please be patient, especially near release points; 
  mistakes do occasionally happen, and people do sometimes run out of 
  volunteer time. 

so according to this, I should be waiting at least more 11 days patiently
before sending a followup.

P.S.
I think, and hope that the Debian is "open" project.

Subject: glibc 2.1.1 status

Just so everyone knows...I am bringing my sun4m home so that I can test
and debug this glibc 2.1.1 problem further. In the mean time I am going to
upload glibc 2.1.1-5 with a preinst script that _will_ fail in sun4m and
non kernel 2.2 systems.

For the interested, I don't see any vfork() calls in init, so I'm not so
sure this is the problem. I am starting to think that there is a missing
signal (or an errant one). Give me some time (or if you are impatient, try
some debugging on your own and share your results).

For all of you bitten by this mishap I appologize, please email me
privately if you need assistance getting your system back up.

Ben

Subject: KDE Debian packages

For those of you interested...KDE is available via apt-get at the following
site:

add this to your /etc/apt/sources.list file

deb http://snowcrash.tdyc.com/debian slink rkrusty
or
deb http://snowcrash.tdyc.com/debian potato rkrusty

depending on your version.  

They are still being worked on and fixed up as the ones on ftp.kde.org are
not up to speed and have other issues I won't go into.  I am also in the process
of fixing up the debian stuff in the KDE CVS tree itself so soon they will be up
to snuff and everything should be workin the way they should.  If your
interested in keeping up to speed on this process, a mailing list has been
created for that purpose. Send mail to majordomo@tdyc.com with a body of
subscribe kde

Currently there are i386 and alpha versions available.  (And partial powerpc
versions).  Sparc should be coming along soon as well.  I have also available
other extra packages such as kpilot, khotkeys and kthememgr.  (tho kthememgr is
HUGE!).

Ivan
