<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.
</p>

<p>
Richard Braakman <a href="mail#1">posted</a> about <b>plans for the next
release of Debian</b>. He listed several possible goals for the next
release, including no <a href="mail#2">release critical bugs</a>, working
disk sets for all architectures, PAM support, perl 5.005, and FHS compliance.
"<i>The freeze is at least one month away, and possibly a lot more than
that.</i>"

Dave Neil of Corel
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00256.html">
posted</a> about <b>what Corel's planning to do with Debian</b>.
He discusses how Corel plans to modify the Debian install procedure for
their distribution -- including an X based installation. They seem very open
to feedback from the Debian community.

In security news, <b>rsync has a security hole</b> that can be triggered in
rare cases. A fix has been <a href="mail#3">uploaded</a> to stable and
unstable. A security hole has also been <a href="mail#7">fixed</a> in zmailer.

Anthony Towns 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9905/msg00010.html">
posted</a> about <b>IPv6 and Debian</b>. A debian-ipv6 mailing list has been
created. There is some minimal support for IPv6 in potato's netbase, and
several other packages have been built with IPv6 support and are available
at locations listed in the message.

<b>The Debian JP project
<a href="../../oldurl?http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce-99/msg00022.html">
released</a> slink-JP this week</b>, which consists of over 200 Japanese
related Debian packages. According to <a href="mail#4">this mail</a>, the
members of Debian JP are interested in becoming Debian developers as well and
merging their work into the Debian project.
</p>

<p>
<a name="policy"></a>
<b>The debian-policy mailing list has been heating up lately, and a lot of
proposals are now in the pipeline.</b> These include adopting the FHS, creating
a utmp group, adding libtool .la files to -dev packages, and using logrotate
instead of savelog. For details, read the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg00004.html">weekly
policy summary</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>If you're using Debian Sparc, beware</b> -- the glibc2.1 uploaded last
week is still not <a href="mail#5">completely there yet</a> and tends to hose
systems. For now the brave are advised to run at least a 2.2.7 kernel before
upgrading to glibc2.1.1.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unofficial packages of the latest version of KDE</b> are now
<a href="mail#6">available</a> for i386 and alpha. Ivan E. Moore has
CVS access to the KDE source code and will be making the KDE source be able
to build .deb's out of the box with no modifications. Of course, KDE remains
out of Debian due to the license issues.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include the following and 17
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html">more</a>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/gnujsp.html"></a>: A free
implementation of Sun's Java Server Pages
<li><a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/interpreters/libxml-parser-perl.html">
libxml-parser-perl</a>:A Perl extension interface to James Clark's XML parser 
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/editors/nvi-m17n.html"></a>:
Multilingualized nvi (
<a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/editors/nvi-m17n-canna.html">with
Canna</a>, and 
<a href="../../../../Packages/unstable/editors/nvi-m17n-common.html">common
files</a>)

openldap-gateways</a>: OpenLDAP Gateways

<p>
<b>Server news</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a name="non-us"></a>
<b>The long-awaited new non-US master server</b>, pandora.debian.org, is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9905/msg00011.html">up
and running</a> and non-us.debian.org will soon point to it in the DNS. The
new machine will end the problems we've been having with non-us for a long
time. Perhaps the most important change is that non-us is now split into
main, contrib, and non-free just like the rest of Debian. All developers have
accounts on the new machine. Any uploads made to non-us in the past month need
to be redone.
<li>
Ben Collins and Ward Deng have
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc-9905/msg00056.html">set
up</a> a <b>sparc build daemon</b> on xia01, which started work this week.
</ul>
