Subject: slink release is delayed

As some of you have probably noticed by now the slink release, which was
scheduled for earlier today (or yesterday depending on your timezone).
This is not an error: the release for slink has been delayed by 1 week,
so the actual release will happen on March 9, 00:00 GMT.

There are a couple of reaons for this delay, ranging from some internal
struggles to upgrade-failures that were discovered at the last moment. 
They will be sorted out during this week, so the final release should
not have any problems.

The slink release has been a learning experience, and I hope we can
prevent the problems we had with this release in the future. All
predicted major criseses have happened by now, so from here on the road
should be smooth..

Wichert.

&gt;&gt; News

 Linux Hardware Solutions, Inc. a premier supplier of Linux systems and 
service announce support for the Debian Project of Software in the Public 
Interest, Inc.

 The support comes in the form of a Linux Hardware Solution PS350RR-100 
RAID rackmount server with 256 MB RAM attached to a dedicated colocation 
connection at Mindspring Enterprises' data center in Atlanta, Georgia to 
act as the new ftp.debian.org server.
 
 Tony Copeland, Director of Sales and Marketing at LHS, said "As 
beneficiaries of the hard work and dedication of the Linux community we 
are glad that we could offer assistance to the Debian team and encourage 
the further development of Linux as a whole."
 
 The server has a retail value of $6100 and has been custom configured to 
address the specific needs of the Debian team.
 
 Linux Hardware Solutions President Kit Cosper said, "When we became aware 
that the Debian Project was in need of a new server we opened a dialog to 
determine how LHS could provide the maximum level of service and support 
to the dedicated people that constitute the Debian team.  After discussing 
the options we assembled a system to serve not only their present needs, 
but future expansion as well."

Subject: slink release delayed 
From: Guy Maor &lt;maor@debian.org&gt;

Why delay?

We've underestimated the severity of several bugs.  The bugs under
consideration are:

dpkg-dev crashed on non-English
	I have a simple workaround which simply shuts off i18n.  I
	will upload an NMU tonight.

pcmcia 2.0.34 not usable
	This is solved by simply removing it.  We provide 35 and 36 as
	well.  Hamm only provided 34.  Brian Mays, could you confirm this?

procmail security error

This does not mean that the gates are open for all changes!  Each
upload should be decided by the metric - Is it by itself important
enough to delay?  So practically all changes will continue to be
rejected.

As in other things, we are reaching a state where doing things by the
seat of pants is becoming insufficient.  I intend to write a document
which describes how release management should happen.  It will be a
combination of implementation and policy, so I will post it here for
review.  Hopefully we can improve the process for a potato release.


Guy
