#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="March 1st, 1999" SUMMARY="Release delay; Debian on Empeg"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community. We are reporting this week from LinuxWorld Expo in San
Jose, California. This issue of DWN is a day late, I apologize for the delay.
</p>

<p>
<b>The release of Debian 2.1 has been delayed by one week.</b> There was a
release <a href="http://netgod.net/~slash/articles/99/03/01/195210_F.shtml">
IRC party</a> held on irc.debian.org on Monday, but despite what you may
have heard there, the release was not made on time. "<i>There are a couple
of reaons for this delay, ranging from some internal struggles to 
upgrade failures that were discovered at the last moment.</i>" For more
details, see <a href="mail#1">Wichert's message</a> and <a href="mail#3">
Guy's message</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian's booth at LinuxWorld is up and running.</b> If you're in town for
LinuxWorld, do stop by booth #1445 and get some free CD's. News from the 
booth at Linuxworld will appear
<a href="http://kitenet.net/~bad/linuxworld.html">here</a>.
<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/news/technology/story/18222.html">Here</a>
is a Wired News article about the Debian booth and the Mac SE we have
running Debian there. By the way, according to a
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02392.html">
script</a> Lars Wirzenius wrote, Debian contains about 62,895,190 lines of 
code. And all those lines of code are scrolling by on a monitor at LinuxWorld.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian is now the distribution used in the Empeg in-car mp3 player.</b> 
One of these neat little boxes is actually at the Debian booth at
LinuxWorld. For more on the Empeg, see
<a href="http://www.empeg.com/main.html">their home page</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Brian White is
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02745.html">
stepping down</a></b> from his position of Release Manager. Richard
Braakman or another volunteer will take his place. The events 
leading up to this, occuring in the last few days of the freeze, were
ugly. Mistakes were made, resulting in about a gigabyte of extra traffic
to each mirror. Harsh words were
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02712.html">
exchanged</a>. Hopefully the parties involved can put this behind them and
continue to work in other areas of Debian.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Gimp logo contest</b> is
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02858.html">
over</a>.
"<i>Next week the logo team will present the best logos, from which
all developers can choose a winner by vote. The current logo
will also be a possible option.</i>" A discussion is also
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02710.html">
underway</a> about what license to use for the winning logo.
</p>

<p>
Joel Klecker
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02831.html">
posted</a> about <b>glibc 2.1</b>, which will be showing up in unstable soon
after slink is released. One important change in glibc 2.1 is that it uses a
<tt>utmpd</tt>, so programs that once needed to be setuid to write to utmp
(like xterm) will no longer need special permissions.
</p>

<p>
<b>In the realm of security</b>, a temporary file security hole is present
in mutt. A
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-changes-9902/msg02659.html">
fix</a> is in incoming.
</p>

<p>
Jonathan Walther has written up a
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~krooger/HOWTO-PGP-Key-Signing">short
HOWTO</a> on <b>PGP key signing</b>, which is a useful reference when you
finally meet another developer, only to discover neither of you has any clue
about how to exchange PGP signatures (a common occurrence, in my experience).
</p>

<p>
<b>Another Debian convert</b>: Mike of the comic strip User Friendly is perhaps
the first fictional Debian user, as depicted in 
<a href="http://www.userfriendly.org/cartoons/archives/99mar/19990301.html">
this cartoon</a>.

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/doc/ldp-ligs.html">ldp-ligs</a>,
the Linux Installation and Getting Started Guide
<li>The
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/interpreters/pike.html">pike</A>
programming language.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/mail/youbin.html">youbin</a>
(<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/mail/youbin-client.html">youbin-client</a>,
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/mail/xyoubin.html">xyoubin</a>),
a mail notification tool
<li>The Debian Bug Tracking system's engine is
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02556.html">
packaged</a>, though not yet uploaded.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Server news</b>
<ul>
<li>non-us.debian.org continues to have troubles; there is now a good non-us
mirror in 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-user-9902/msg03707.html">
Canada</a>.
<li>A new ftp.debian.org is coming: <a href="http://www.linux-hw.com/">Linux
Hardware Solutions</a>
<a href="mail#2">donated</a> a $6100 "<i>Linux Hardware
Solution PS350RR-100 RAID rackmount server with 256 MB RAM attached to a
dedicated colocation connection at Mindspring Enterprises' data center in
Atlanta, Georgia</i>". Now we just need one of those boxes on every
developer's desk...
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to previous news items:
<ul>
<li>A new mailing list called <tt>debian-gtk-gnome</tt> has been created,
for the use of maintainers of imlib, gtk and gnome, and any packages
depending on them. Speaking of gnome, a statement on the
<a href="http://www.gnome.org/">gnome web site</a> raised the 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02483.html">
question</a>: should gnome be the default Debian
desktop in the future? The consensus reached was that that Debian will 
support any equivilant DFSG free desktops on an equal footing.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Off topic email of the week</b>
(<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg02688.html">speaking</a> of the Debian logo, after some very off topic conversation):
<blockquote>
<i>
we could compromise: a bumblebee attempting intimate relations with an 
orca.
<br>
i'm glad that's settled. now the only question remaining is "which one 
of them should be in drag?"
</i>
