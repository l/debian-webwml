  of "learn".  It seems to be interesting if we can make Japanese

Hi,

This is the recent news [7/27/1999 - 8/2/1999] from Debian JP
Project.  The prefix below such as debian-users and debian-devel
indicates debian-{users, devel}@debian.or.jp respectively.

* [debian-users:17000] PRE RELEASE 'Debimaru' 
  The pre-release of yet another mini distribution 'Debimaru'.  The
  aim of this project is to make Debian installation as easy as
  possible for Japanese Debian newbies.  This "subset" edition should
  be 100% backward compatible with Debian GNU/Linux.  The slink-based
  version is going to be released in September, and the potato-based
  one will follow on the heels of it, too.

  Noriaki Matoi starts new documentation project to help the Debian

  FAQ called topics-ml maintained by Fumitoshi UKAI, but he gave up
  updating it.  Matoi-san and other daredevils discuss which system
  (like hns, FreeBSD QandA, etc.) is appropriate for it.
