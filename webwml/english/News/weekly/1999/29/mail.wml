* [debian-devel:09928] severity 38107 important

* [debian-users:16765] learn

Hi,

indicates debian-{users, devel}@debian.or.jp respectively.

* [debian-users:17000] PRE RELEASE 'Debimaru' 
  The pre-release of yet another mini distribution 'Debimaru'.  The
  aim of this project is to make Debian installation as easy as
  possible for Japanese Debian newbies.  This "subset" edition should
  be 100% backward compatible with Debian GNU/Linux.  The slink-based
  version is going to be released in September, and the potato-based
  one will follow on the heels of it, too.

  Noriaki Matoi starts new documentation project to help the Debian

  updating it.  Matoi-san and other daredevils discuss which system
  (like hns, FreeBSD QandA, etc.) is appropriate for it.
