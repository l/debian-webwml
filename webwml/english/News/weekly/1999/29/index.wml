#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-8-3" SUMMARY="DpkgV2 reaction; another book; new maintainer problems; losing a developer."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a combined two-week edition of Debian Weekly News.
</p>

<p>
<b>Ian Jackson's 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01472.html">first
reaction</a> to the post of the DpkgV2 spec</b> was extreme: "<i>One of the main
reasons that dpkg is unapproachable by poor to mediocre programmers is that
it must perform a complex task with a very high level of reliability</i>".
After some time to think it over though, he 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01773.html">concluded
</a> that "<i>it's probably a good thing for both my dpkg and yours that both
projects exist. Maybe we'll spur each other on.</i>" And indeed, this week Ian
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01780.html">uploaded
</a> to experimental his first release of dpkg in a very long time.
</p>

<p>
<a name="book"></a>
<b>Yet another Debian book will soon be published</b>: <i>Debian Gnu/Linux 2.2
Unleashed</i>. This brings the count of Debian books in English up to three;
<i>Debian GNU/Linux; Guide to Installation and Usage</i> is now
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735709149/10102519/002-9416152-4171441">for
sale</a> on Amazon.com, and <i>The Debian Linux User's Guide</i> has been
around for a while now. Of course the amusing and disturbing thing about this
newest title is it is
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672317001/qid=933716997/sr=1-1/002-9416152-4171441">
due to be published</a> in September and claims to include a Debian 2.2 CD.
Will Debian 2.2 even be released by then?
</p>

<p>
Josip Rodin has been working on the
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">release critical bug
list</a>. He
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-9907/msg00074.html">mailed</a>
each maintainer with a release critical bug asking what their plans are to deal
with it. This had immediate results -- soon after his mailing, the number of
critical bugs
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01703.html">dropped
drastically</a> (although 230 remain open).
</p>

<p>
In security news, <b>samba has a number of security holes</b> that have been fixed
in the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-99/msg00018.html">
latest release</a>.
</p>

<b>Becoming a developer is taking increasingly long</b>, to judge by tales of
woe like <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01269.html">
this</a>, and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01598.html">this</a>.
People who are very motivated to work on Debian have been stuck in the
new-maintainer queue for months, and have lately been looking for ways to
contribute even though they cannot upload packages. RaphaÃ«l Hertzog has a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg01530.html">
workaround</a> for this problem: registered developers could "sponsor" the
work of a non-developer, make sure it's okay and upload it. The idea is
catching on, though it doesn't address the real problem with the queue.
</p>

<p>
<b>We lost a developer this week.</b> Leon Breedt
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg02077.html">
resigned</a> from the project, citing several problems with Debian
that we should take very seriously.
</p>

<p>
<b>On a brighter note</b>, Debian is one of
<a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/linuxworld/lw-1999-07/lw-07-finalists.html">
two finalists</a> for LinuxWorld's editors choice award for
"<i>Distribution/Server</i>". And the Associated Press in Germany released
<a href="../../../1999/19990727">two news items</a> about Debian.
</p>

<p>
Marc A. Volovic
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9907/msg00151.html">
updated</a> his <a href="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/html/linux.phtml">Debian
Alpha HOWTO</a>. It's work in progress but it's already a good source of
information if you plan to install Debian on an Alpha box.
</p>

<p>
We have <a href="mail#mail1">two weeks' worth</a> of Debian-JP news summaries.
One thing they mention is two new simplified Japanese Debian installs, 
<a href="http://dice.debian.gr.jp/">Dice Linux</a> and
<a href="http://llc.linet.gr.jp/~yochi/debimaru/">Debimaru</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unofficial .debs of XFree86 3.3.4 are available for testing.</b> Branden
Robinson and Adam Heath put these together and made them available less than
48 hours after the release of the upstream source files. So far, there seem
to be no significant issues for i386 users, but m68k is having compile-time
problems. Official XFree86 3.3.4 packages will be available soon. In the
meantime, the unofficial ones are available from
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~branden/">the X Strike Force</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include the following and      
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html">8 more</a>:
</p>
<ul> 
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/admin/console-apt.html">console-apt</a>: Text-based user interface for APT
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/net/dhcp-dns.html">dhcp-dns</a>: Dynamic DNS updates for DHCP
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/admin/ext2resize.html">ext2resize</a>: an ext2 filesystem resizer
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/x11/fsviewer.html">fsviewer</a>: FSViewer is a NeXT FileViewer lookalike for Window Maker.
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/games/g5.html">g5</a>: gtk-based 5-in-a-row game
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/sound/gcd.html">gcd</a>: a GTK-based CD player
</ul>

<p>
<b>Followups to previous news items</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Manoj's proposal for the /usr/share/doc transition received 4 objections
and <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=40706">died</a>.
Proposals abound on debian-policy; this issue has been the main topic there for
weeks. It will probably be passed to the Technical Committee since a consensus
seems elusive.
<li>
The perl upgrade is
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00019.html">
very nearly complete</a>. Just a few packages remain to be upgraded and they
won't affect most people.
</ul>

<p>
Thanks to Randolph Chung, Katsura S. Yoshio, and Christian Meder for
<a href="../../contributing">contributing</a>. Also, a special thanks to
Jason Gunthorpe, Christoph Lameter, and especially Sean Perry for making
this edition of DWN possible as I battled with DNS troubles, moving, and
dead motherboards.
