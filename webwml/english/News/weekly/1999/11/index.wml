<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="development"></a>
<b>With Slink out the door, it's time for another giddy round of
development.</b> To start things off, glibc 2.1 has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9903/msg00713.html">
uploaded</a> to unstable and is sure to cause lots of 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg01185.html">
interesting breakage</a>. It's already known to break prcs, rvplayer,
libtricks, and many other things. Next, version 5.005 of perl will be uploaded
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00979.html">
very soon</a>, possibly breaking some 47 module packages.
In short, "<i>unstable is called unstable for a reason</i>" and you shouldn't
upgrade to it right now unless you're willing to deal with problems.

continued</a> a discussion about how to <b>get rid of the obsolete 'base'
package</b>. Many interesting aspects of the dpkg system were discussed,
especially the way to remove this essential package without damaging your
system. Of course, this has been discussed before with no resolution --
hopefully this discussion will eventually lead to some code in a package 
that will get rid of base at last.

<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00411.html">
Here's</a> the start of an interesting thread about looking at the registry
file from a Windows install to <b>ease auto-detection of hardware</b> when
installing Debian. It branched out to cover other ways of doing auto-detection.
</p>

<p>
<b>A program called "swim"</b> was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00856.html">
announced</a> this week. It is a package manager like dpkg (and indeed is
compatible with dpkg), but uses a binary database for speed and has other
interesting features. 
</p>

<p>
Here is an <a href="mail#1">example</a> of the use of the <b>new source 
format for dpkg</b>, which can support multiple patches and tarballs.

<p>
<b>Should Debian object to companies that use "Debian" as part of their
name</b>, their domain name, or a product they sell? Wichert is 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00994.html">
asking</a> for thoughts on this important issue we need to decide.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new version of APT</b> has been <a href="mail#2">released</a>.
It features a new plug-in architecture, a new config file, and lots of
documentation.
</p>

<p>
<b>Those who are making their own CD's of Slink</b> might be interested in
some "<i>simple but tasteful</i>" <a
href="http://www.debian.org/~dunham/CD">CD
art</a>.
</p>

<p>
We haven't talked about the Hurd port for a while;
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-9903/msg00110.html">
here</a> is a <b>state-of-the-Hurd report</b>.
</p>

<p>
The
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00797.html">
flame war of the week</a> started as a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg00213.html">
discussion</a> of ways to <b>disassociate non-free and contrib from Debian
proper</b>. One way to do that would be to move them to a server called
nonfree.debian.org. But as I said, a flame war followed, so read with caution.
</p>

<p>
