<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

<p>
<b>Freeze watch</b>: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Anthony Towns did some invenstigation to find how
many packages currently in Debian are not installable because of
unforfillable dependancies. His report 
(19991007201246.B13833@azure.humbug.org.au) lists reasonably low numbers,
around 80 per architecture. The two ports we are not going to release with
potato have significantly more problems.
