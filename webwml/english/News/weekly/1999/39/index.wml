<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>It's official: Debian is not currently accepting new members.</b> Wichert
Akkerman posted (19991011035304.A19217@mors.net) explaining the situation:
"<i>As you may have heard or even experienced yourself, Debian's
new-maintainer team is currently not processing requests. 
The team wanted to resolve some problems they observed with the way
Debian maintainership is current[ly] handled, and decided to close
new-maintainer until these have been fixed.</i>" He also explained what is
being done to rectify the situation:
"<i>We are currently working on a new structure for handling new-maintainer
requests, and hope to have this finished as soon as possible. There will
be a proposal on this posted on the debian-devel list in the near
future.
Once the new structure is in place new-maintainer will be reopened, and
we will make an announcement.</i>"

<b>Freeze watch</b>: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Some work towards the release this week included:
<ul>
<li>Boot-floppies for potato were uploaded. Though this is an "<i>early
access Alpha version</i>", it's very good news since it marks the first time
potato has had boot floppies of any kind. (oaaepsz9pk.fsf@burrito.onshore.com)
It now takes one floppy more to
install: the rescue disk has split into boot and root disks. Apt will be the
only install method on the new floppies, and work has begun on an apt
configurator to walk the user through setting up apt.

<li>Anthony Towns did some investigation to find how
many packages currently in Debian are not installable because of
unforfillable dependancies. His report
(19991007201246.B13833@azure.humbug.org.au) lists reasonably low numbers,
around 80 per architecture. The two ports we are not going to release with
potato have significantly more problems.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In an effort to reduce non-technical discussions on debian-devel, a
debian-project mailing list has been created. It is an open list for
organizational and if necessary, political discussions.

Jules Bean posted a report
(Pine.SOL.4.10a.9910081230210.15475-100000@red.csi.cam.ac.uk) of Debian's
presence as Linux Expo in London. And here's
(199910080727.JAA09535@bernin.grnbl_domain) a report of Debian's presense at
the Pluto Meeting in Italy. Of course, Atlanta Linux Showcase is fast
approaching, and lots of Debian people will be at our booth there.

filling in as guest editor next week while Joey Hess is at Atlanta Linux
Showcase.
