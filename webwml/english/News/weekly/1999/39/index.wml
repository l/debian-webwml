<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="new-maintainer"></a>
<b>It's official: Debian is not currently accepting new members.</b> Wichert
Akkerman
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9910/msg00003.html">posted</a>
explaining the situation:
"<i>As you may have heard or even experienced yourself, Debian's
new-maintainer team is currently not processing requests. 
The team wanted to resolve some problems they observed with the way
Debian maintainership is current[ly] handled, and decided to close
new-maintainer until these have been fixed.</i>" He also explained what is
being done to rectify the situation:
"<i>We are currently working on a new structure for handling new-maintainer
requests, and hope to have this finished as soon as possible. There will
be a proposal on this posted on the debian-devel list in the near
future.
Once the new structure is in place new-maintainer will be reopened, and
we will make an announcement.</i>"

<b>Freeze watch</b>: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Some work towards the release this week included:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a name="boot_floppies"></a>
<b>Boot-floppies for potato were just uploaded.</b> Though this is an
"<i>early access Alpha version</i>", it's 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-9910/msg00038.html">very good
news</a> since it marks the first time potato has had boot floppies of any
kind. It now takes one floppy more to install: the rescue disk has split
into boot and root disks. Apt will be the only install method on the new
floppies, and 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9910/msg00211.html">work has
begun</a> on an apt configurator to walk new users through setting up apt.
<li>Anthony Towns did some investigation to find how many packages currently
in Debian are not installable because of unmet dependencies. His 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00446.html">
report</a> lists reasonably low numbers, around 80 per architecture.
The two ports we are not going to release with potato have significantly
more problems.
</ul>

<p>
<a name="book"></a>
<b>Debian in a box</b> should start appearing in stores soon. The boxed set
includes the new O'Reilly Debian book. Read all about it on
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-850000.html">News.com</a>, and
in the <a
href="../../oldurl?http://www.mercurycenter.com/premium/business/docs/linux12.htm">
New York Times</a>. The whole O'Reilly book is also available
<a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/debian/chapter/">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
In an effort to <b>reduce non-technical discussions on debian-devel</b>, a
debian-project mailing list has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9910/msg00004.html">
created</a>. It is an open list for organizational and if necessary, political discussions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian booths are popping up at shows all over.</b>
Jules Bean posted a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00515.html">report</a>
of Debian's presence as Linux Expo in London. And here's a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-news-99/msg00039.html">report</a> of
Debian's presence at the Pluto Meeting in Italy. Of course, Atlanta Linux
Showcase is fast approaching, and lots of Debian people will be at our booth
there.
