<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Freeze watch</b>: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Some work towards the release this week included:
<ul>
<li>Boot-floppies for potato were uploaded. Though this is an "<i>early
access Alpha version</i>", it's very good news since it marks the first time
potato has had boot floppies of any kind. It now takes one floppy more to
install: the rescue disk has split into boot and root disks. Apt will be the
only install method on the new floppies, and there is still a need for
someone to write an apt configurator to walk the user through setting up apt.

<li>Anthony Towns did some investigation to find how
many packages currently in Debian are not installable because of
unforfillable dependancies. His report
(19991007201246.B13833@azure.humbug.org.au) lists reasonably low numbers,
around 80 per architecture. The two ports we are not going to release with
potato have significantly more problems.
</ul>

Jules Bean posted a report
(Pine.SOL.4.10a.9910081230210.15475-100000@red.csi.cam.ac.uk) of Debian's
presence as Linux Expo in London.
