<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Freeze watch</b>: Debian is still scheduled to freeze on November first,
just a few weeks away. Some work towards the release this week included:
<ul>
<li>Boot-floppies for potato were uploaded. Though this is an "<i>early
access Alpha version</i>", it's very good news since it marks the first time
potato has had boot floppies of any kind. (oaaepsz9pk.fsf@burrito.onshore.com)
It now takes one floppy more to
install: the rescue disk has split into boot and root disks. Apt will be the
only install method on the new floppies, and work has begun on an apt
configurator to walk the user through setting up apt.

<li>Anthony Towns did some investigation to find how
many packages currently in Debian are not installable because of
unforfillable dependancies. His report
(19991007201246.B13833@azure.humbug.org.au) lists reasonably low numbers,
around 80 per architecture. The two ports we are not going to release with
potato have significantly more problems.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In an effort to reduce non-technical discussions on debian-devel, a
debian-project mailing list has been created. It is an open list for
organizational and if necessary, political discussions.

Jules Bean posted a report
(Pine.SOL.4.10a.9910081230210.15475-100000@red.csi.cam.ac.uk) of Debian's
presence as Linux Expo in London. And here's
(199910080727.JAA09535@bernin.grnbl_domain) a report of Debian's presense at
the Pluto Meeting in Italy. Of course, Atlanta Linux Showcase is fast
approaching, and lots of Debian people will be at our booth there.
