<p>
<strong>Welcome</strong> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community. It's a day late and a bit short this week due
to the editor's vacation.
</p>

<strong>The logo team has chosen 4 candidates for our new logo.</strong> 
Wichert has made a <a href="http://www.debian.org/~wakkerma/logos/">web
page</a> displaying 4 excellent new logos and our current logo. 
You can also read Wichert's <a href="mail#1">commentary</a> on each logo,
which begins the one week discussion period before voting begins. 
At the same time, Wichert has <a href="mail#2">proposed</a> a vote on
whether we should have a single logo or an official and a
liberal use logo.

<strong>Neal Stephenson</strong>, award winning author of Snow Crash and other cyberpunk
science fiction turns out to be a user and fan of Debian. He's written an
<a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html">article</a> on
operating systems in which he enthuses about Debian and specifically about
the bug tracking system. "<q>I use a distribution called Debian [...] what
really sold me on it was its phenomenal bug database</q>"
</p>

<p>
<strong>What's the buggiest package in Debian?</strong> It's easy to find out using Raphaël
Hertzog's <a href="http://master.debian.org/~hertzog/qa/">pages</a> which
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-9903/msg00106.html">
score packages</a> based on different criteria, including number of bugs, number
of lintian errors, and ages of bugs. 
Also, the pages listing critical bug reports are back online, at a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00105.html">new
location</a>.

A 12 page "<q>review of Debian 2.1 as a platform for econometric
research</q>" has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9903/msg02726.html">
written</a> by James MacKinnon, an economics professor.

<strong>No new packages were added to Debian this week</strong>, though several are
waiting in Incoming. There are some important updates to existing packages
though:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On the security front</strong>, a <a href="mail#3">new procmail</a> is
out that fixes some buffer overflows.
<li><strong>An official test build of XFree86 3.3.3.1</strong> is
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00182.html">
available</a> at last. Note that versions of X in Debian are
<a href="mail#4">not vulnerable</a> to /tmp symlink race security holes that
have been reported on bugtraq.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Corrections</strong> to last week's news:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The sgml press release mentioned last week was in fact released right as
last week's Debian Weekly News went to press.
</ul>
