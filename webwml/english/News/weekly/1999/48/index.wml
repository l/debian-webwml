<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. Once again we skipped a week; this is a two week edition.
Debian weekly news has now summarized a full year of events in Debian. A
<a href="../../1999/timeline">timeline</a> of the most important stories of 1999 is
available as a special supplement to this issue.
</p>

Debian has won the 1999 Linux Journal Readers' Choice award for "<i>Favorite
Distribution</i>". We won with 27.3% of the vote, compared to 27.0% for SuSE
and 23.6% for Red Hat. The award appears in the January edition of 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>.
</p>

<p>
Richard Braakman <a href="mail#mail2">posted</a> <b>plans for the freeze</b>. No
completely new packages (like those listed near the end of this newsletter)
will be accepted after January 2nd. He also mentions another bug-squashing
event. And it looks like the next version of Debian will be code-named
"<i>woody</i>", continuing the Toy Story theme (and opening the door for
lots of off-color jokes). Richard followed up with a post that looks beyond
the freeze and outlines a timeline for release. <a href="mail#mail3">The plan</a>
is to go through one of two short <i>"test cycles"</i> inside a very short
freeze, releasing near the end of February.

<b>Lintian now supports local overrides.</b> This allows a package to say that
it knows it triggers a lintian error or warning, but it wants that ignored.
Use these overrides with caution, and be sure to read 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg00971.html">this
message</a> first.
</p>

<p>
<a name="traceroute"></a>
<b>Should /sbin and /usr/sbin be in a normal user's path so they can easily
run traceroute and other similar programs?</b> 
It seems that many people 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg00944.html">make
this change</a> when installing Debian.
Since the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg01150.html">FHS
says</a> that "<i>users should not have to place any of the sbin
directories in their path</i>", people seem to agree that the real problem
is that traceroute and some other programs do not belong in sbin in the
first place. But just how to fix this without breaking things that expect to
find these programs in sbin is still under discussion; symlinks
would seem to be the easy solution but some people 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg01150.html">dislike
that idea</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>The source code for Quake 1 was GPL'd last week</b>, resulting in several
ITP's and other posts wondering when it would be put in Debian. Be assured that
the current maintainer of the quake packages in non-free does intend to package the
source and move it into main. After that was resolved, another concern came
up. It seems that quake and doom are 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg01159.html">not
allowed in some countries</a>, including Brazil and (<a href="mail#mail1">maybe</a>)
Germany because of their violent content. People running
a full Debian mirror in those countries could get in legal trouble for
distributing these games. Of course, quake and doom have been present in
non-free for quite a while, and have already presumably been mirrored into
those countries. A long thread resulted, with no real conclusion reached yet.
Concerned mirror admins in these countries might want to set up some local
exclusions for these games in the mean time.

<p>
<b>CD images for 2.1r4 are available now</b> from 
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org">cdimage.debian.org</a>
</p>

<p>
For the first time, systems are being sold preinstalled with not just Debian
GNU/Linux, but with <b>Debian GNU/Hurd preinstalled</b> as well on a separate
partition. Space-Time Systems is the British company
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-commercial-99/msg00007.html">
offering these systems</a>.
</p>

<p>
Two more sparc machines are 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg00932.html">available</a>
for developers to use.

Following up to last edition's item about Ian Murdock's <em>Progeny</em>
project, here is a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9912/msg00773.html">message
from Ian</a> with some details.
