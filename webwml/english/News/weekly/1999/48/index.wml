<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

Should /sbin be in a normal user's path so traceroute and other programs can
easily be ran by them? (87yaaqvfdj.fsf@HSE-Montreal-ppp19485.qc.sympatico.ca)
It seems that many people make just this change when installing Debian.
(19991219145536.A29922@master.debian.org)
Since the FHS says that "<i>users should not have to place any of the sbin
directories in their path</i>", people seem to agree that the real problem
is that traceroute and some other programs do not belong in /sbin in the
first place. But just how to fix this is still under discussion; symlinks
would seem to be the easy solution but some people dislike that idea
(19991220094718.M22466@taz.net.au).
