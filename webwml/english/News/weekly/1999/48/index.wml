<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.

Lintian now supports local overrides. This allows a package to say that it
knows it triggers a lintian error or warning, but it wants that ignored. Use
with caution. (19991219154746.A381@benham.net)

Debian has won the 1999 Linux Journal Reader' Choice award for "<i>Favorite
Distibution</i>". We won with 27.3% of the vote, compared to 27.0% for SuSE
and 23.6% for Red Hat. The award appears in the January edition of 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/">Linux Journal</a>.

Should /sbin be in a normal user's path so traceroute and other programs can
easily be ran by them? (87yaaqvfdj.fsf@HSE-Montreal-ppp19485.qc.sympatico.ca)
It seems that many people make just this change when installing Debian.
(19991219145536.A29922@master.debian.org)
Since the FHS says that "<i>users should not have to place any of the sbin
directories in their path</i>", people seem to agree that the real problem
is that traceroute and some other programs do not belong in /sbin in the
first place. But just how to fix this is still under discussion; symlinks
would seem to be the easy solution but some people dislike that idea
(19991220094718.M22466@taz.net.au).

<p>
CD images for 2.1r4 are available now from 
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org">cdimage.debian.org</a>

<p>
Two more machines are available for developers to use.
