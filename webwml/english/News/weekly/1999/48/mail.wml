Subject: Quake in Germany - not illegal? 

"Quake is indexed in Germany, not banned. This means it's only allowed
to sell it to adults and advertising is prohibited."

Just saw this on a web page. It's URL is (for who is interested)
http://www.inside3d.com/qip

So maybe it isn't a problem to have quake in the archive after all...
