#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-8-10" SUMMARY="Freeze date set; FHS transition delay; fakeroot problems."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to the 30th issue of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter
for the Debian developer community.
</p>

<p>
<b>The freeze date for Potato has been set</b>: We will
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9908/msg00007.html">
freeze on November first</a>, so long as some items like boot floppies and
release critical bug fixes are well under way at that point.
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman, the Debian Project Leader, 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9908/msg00005.html">
addressed</a> <b>the FHS /usr/share/doc issue</b>: "<i>I request all developers to
NOT move to the FHS right now</i>". The Technical Committee is working to
resolve the issue, and packages already using /usr/share/doc will likely
just need to be changed again when they reach a resolution.
</p>

<p>
<a name="rumor"></a>
A <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00245.html">rumor</a>
is circulating that Debian <b>may have stopped accepting new maintainers until
after potato is released</b>. There has been no official response to this rumor
yet.
</p>

<p>
Stephane Bortzmeyer has put together a
<a href="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/apt-sources/">web
page</a> that is the "<i>unofficial list of unofficial sources</i>" for
Debian packages. It is <b>a list of apt archives outside Debian proper</b>,
and anyone can add their archive to the list. This promises to make it much
easier to find apt information. Combined with the rumors of a closed new
maintainer process mentioned above, some people think this is the beginning
of a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00298.html">
slippery slope</a> that leads to a Red hat style contrib.
However, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00300.html">
others point out</a> that these apt repositories are nothing new, and many are
in fact maintained by developers.
</p>

<p>
<b>A warning to people using fakeroot</b>: The current fakeroot and tar in
unstable <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg00148.html">
do not get along</a>. Packages built with them will have files owned by the
user who built the package, not by root.
</p>

<p>
<b>Two security items this week</b>: New versions of 
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19990807">isdnutils</a> and
the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-changes-9908/msg00019.html">
cfingerd package</a> in stable have been released to fix various security
holes.
</p>

<p>

<a href="mail#mail1">available</a>.

Server news:

<ul>
<li>Jason Gunthorpe

Faure, Kubrick and Albert <b>back to life</b> after the previously reported disk
failure. However, the contents of the home directory for these systems has been
lost.
</ul>

<p>
This issue is a little short because of LinuxWorld Expo. Randolph Chung will
be guest editing next week. <b>Pre-expo reports from the show floor</b> indicate
an interesting development: Debian is not alone. Four Debian hardware and
software vendors are also exhibiting at the expo, including Kachina Tech and
Stormix. This in contrast to last year's booth which was an island of Debian,
awash in a sea of Red Hat.
