Hi,

This is the recent news [8/3/1999 - 8/9/1999] from Debian JP Project.
The prefix below such as debian-users, debian-devel and debian-doc
indicates debian-{users,devel,doc}@debian.or.jp respectively.

* [debian-users:17209] Re: Can't install on Optiplex GXpro 200 
  In current rescue disk image for slink, Adaptec aic7xxx driver is
  very broken. So, new disk image based on kernel 2.0.37 is available
  on the following URL:

* [debian-devel:09992] Re: Bug#41570: Can not handle kanji font PS
  Taketoshi Sano appreciates the maintainer of gs package.  The normal
  gs can't deal with the Kanji characters, so we need jp patch to
  handle the Japanese PS files.

* [debian-doc:01135] [Draft] announce for New ML
  jp-policy@debian.or.jp is newly created.  This role is similar to
  the debian-policy@debian.org and expected to be intermittently big
  discussion.  Perhaps, Policy Summary of Debian.org like work would
  be required:)  Anyway, this is the draft Taketoshi Sano wrote for
  announcement.
