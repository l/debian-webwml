<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="debianlogo"></a>
<b>Voting on the license for the Debian logo has begun.</b> The vote also 
encompasses the number of logos that will be used, either one or two.
For details on the options, see the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00021.html">
call for votes</a> and then
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00023.html">
cast your ballot</a>. Of course, only developers can vote.
</p>

<b>Corel is going to release a Debian variant</b>, according to a 
<a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,35166,00.html">news.com 
article</a>. "<i>Corel will base a Linux product [..] on the version of 
Linux from Debian.</i>" Corel appears to be interested in improving 
Debian's ease of installation and use and bundling it with WordPerfect
and other Corel software. They plan to release a beta by August. Debian has
made no official announcement about this yet.

<p>
An interesting development in the past couple of weeks has been more
<b>mainstream online press stories referencing and linking to items that
originate on the Debian mailing lists</b>. For example, 
<a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/feature/1999/04/15/linux_help/index.html">
here's</a> a Salon Magazine story with a link buried in the middle to the
"clueless users" post from 3 weeks ago. And 
<a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now0409.txt">here's</a>
an article on the Perens/Raymond mess with links to postings on our mailing
lists. Unfortunately, none of these links cast Debian in a very positive
light. Other more positive references to Debian in the press this week
include <b>a few mentions in Linux Journal issue #61</b>, where Debian is
revealed as the distribution of choice for one author's PPP servers, and for
another's remotely upgradable secure Internet gateways.
</p>

<p>
<b>Work is beginning on a Chinese translation project.</b>
Some of Debian's web pages have been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-9904/msg00036.html">
translated to Chinese</a>. The debian-chinese mailing list has been created.
The Chinese translation effort is being coordinated by Anthony Wong. If you 
would like to help out with the project, subscribe to the 
debian-chinese mailing list.
