#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-4-12" SUMMARY="Several proposals; maintainer queue delays."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian
developer community.
</p>

<p>
Adam Di Carlo
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-9904/msg00022.html">
posted</a> a <b>list of items that need to be fixed in Slink</b>. This
includes moving in the source to kernel 2.2.5, and makedev and lsof fixes. A
consensus was quickly reached that these fixes need to go into a point
release of Slink.
</p>

<p>
<b>Several proposals of different kinds</b> were made this week:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Here is a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9904/msg00016.html">
proposal</a> for how to <b>make the info system FHS compliant</b>. This would be
another step along the long road to a fully FHS-compliant Debian.
<li>
Avery Pennarun
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00336.html">
posted</a> about a way to <b>allow the use of /dev/modem symlinks safely</b>,
without having to worry about other programs using /dev/ttySx and thus ignoring
the lock files that indicate /dev/modem is locked. He proposes that programs that
access serial devices follow symlinks, so they will follow the /dev/modem symlink
and still lock /dev/ttySx. Fabrizio Polacco 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00388.html">
pointed out</a> that the liblockdev library already does this, but it is only
used by one package. Some discussion followed about changing policy to mandate
programs use the library.
<li>Joey Hess posted a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00435.html">
proposal and explanation</a> of the changes he plans to make to the
xaw-wrappers package so it will <b>not need to use dpkg-divert</b>.
</ul>

<p>
A 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9904/msg00688.html">
thread popped up</a> on debian-user featuring the <b>authors of pine talking
about the copyright of pine</b>. It's worth reading to
understand why the authors of pine have given it the copyright they have,
which keeps it in non-free and allows it to be distributed only as source.
</p>

<p>
There was a bit of <a href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/35/35743.html">
discussion</a> about <b>knfs, the kernel nfs server</b>, and about how
to let it be used when a 2.2.x kernel is in use while still allowing the old user
space nfs server to be used with 2.0.x kernels, and allowing people who
prefer the user space server to continue to use it.
</p>

<p>
Following a thread about <b>how long it takes for the new-maintainer team
to process an application</b>, James Troup sent a <a href="mail#2">mail</a>
that gives a good feel for the current situation. "<i>Processing can take
under 10 minutes or it can take &gt; 1.5 years+.</i>" Hopefully no one in
the queue will have to wait that long...
</p>

<p>
<b>Gtk and glib 1.1 are about to be removed from the archive</b>, to be replaced
with gtk and glib 1.2. This affects a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00523.html">
fair number of packages</a> that are still linked to the old library.
If your package is affected, you have already gotten a bug report,
but it's worth repeating here that all such packages should be recompiled
with gtk 1.2.
</p>

<p>
<b>A debian-perl mailing list</b> has been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00017.html">created</a>.
It will be used for discussion among perl module maintainers, and for the
transition to perl 5.005.
</p>

<p>
Some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00432.html">
discussion</a> took place regarding the <b>splitting up of fvwm-common into
separate packages, or at least renaming it</b>. The package has nothing fvwm-specific
in it anymore.
</p>

<p>
<b>A few packages changed hands this week.</b> Among them were the mysql packages,
which
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00431.html">
were passed back and forth</a> several times before finally ending up in the lap of
Christian Hammers. And Martin Schulze
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9904/msg00497.html">
unleashed</a> upon the developers list a large list of packages he is giving
away for adoption.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security news</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Another version of procmail</b> has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9904/msg00417.html">
uploaded</a>, fixing more buffer overruns.
<li><b>There was some <a href="mail#1">discussion</a> on the BugTraq mailing
list about Debian's policy of web servers exporting /usr/doc to the world</b>,
which allows anyone to see what versions of what software are installed on a
Debian system. This was reported long ago as bug
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/34/34099.html">34099</a> against
apache and as bug <a href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/23/23661.html">23661</a>
against Debian policy. Hopefully now that it's reached such a high-profile
list, policy will be changed soon, and apache fixed.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Server news</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Master.debian.org had an upstream network problem</b> that resulted in
downloads from it going very slowly -- only a few bytes per second. This
didn't affect uploads, but it did affect other things, like the updates
of the web site, mirrors, etc. (This was also responsible for 
<a href="../14/">last week's edition</a> of Debian Weekly News being
delayed an additional 2 days.)
<li>Wichert is setting up a <b>replacement machine for non-us.debian.org</b>,
and it should go online soon if it isn't already by the time you read this.
</ul>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/web/c2html.html">
c2html</a></b> - Highlight C sources for WWW presentation
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/doc/pinfo.html">
pinfo</a></b> - An alternative info-file viewer
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/utils/vfu.html">
vfu</a></b> - A versatile file manager for the console
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/x11/wmcalclock.html">
wmcalclock</a></b> - A clock dock.app
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/xchat-gnome.html">
xchat-gnome</a></b> - IRC client for GNOME
<li><b><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/devel/gbdk">
gbdk</a></b> - Gameboy development kit
<li><b><a href="http://packages.debian.org/cxterm">
cxterm</a></b> - Wide-character xterm for 
Chinese/Korean/Japanese
</ul>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to last week's news:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>There has been some grumbling about the logos that the logo team
picked.</b> Not everyone likes the available choices, and some people
would like to add another logo to the ballot. Darren Benham points out
that this is allowed by our constitution; see his <a href="mail#3">
message</a> for details on proposing an amendment to the logo ballot.
</ul>
