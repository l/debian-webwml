A warm hello from the Greek waters! This message comes to you from a
virtual me via a timewarp, with the help of Darren Benham :)

Anyway, back to bussiness: the discussion period for the second logo
vote has expired, and it is now time to start voting.=20

This is the official call for votes for selection of a Debian logo.
The voting period will last 2 weeks, as standard.
