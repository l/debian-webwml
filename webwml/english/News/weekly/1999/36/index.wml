<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debconf has been released.</b> Debconf is a configuration management tool
that lets Debian packages ask questions at install time using several
different interfaces. Plain text, dialog, GTK and web UI's are currently
supported, as well as non-interactive intallations. It will support remote
databases in the future, allowing whole clusters of machines to be configured
the same. Read the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01500.html">introduction
to Debconf</a> for more information. Quite a few people are eager to begin using
it soon.

<b>Corel has started a closed beta test of their Corel Linux distribution.</b>
Unfortunatly, they did so under a very restrictive license, that 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/20/1051226&amp;mode=nested">
violates</a> the GPL in several respects. The good news is that Bruce Perens
has already
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9909/msg02660.html">contacted
Corel</a> and we're promised that this will be fixed.
</p>

<p>
The debian-laptop list has made a
<a href="http://home.snafu.de/wehe/debian_linux.html">proposal</a> for
<b>making Debian more laptop friendly</b>. The idea is to create special laptop
kernels, plus a laptop meta package that pulls together everything a laptop
user needs. There seems to be "<i>no Linux distribution with a dedicated
laptop support</i>" yet, so Debian would be leading the way in this area.
</p>

<p>
<b>Should proftpd be moved to contrib for security reasons?</b> Many security
holes have been found it it lately and it seems likely more will show up in the
future, so some think it's a good idea to 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01433.html">move it
out</a> of the main distribution. The maintainer prefers to 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01434.html">wait
and see</a> what the situation is like when we freeze.
</p>

<p>
Joey Hess <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01283.html">
posted</a> what he confesses is a "<i>crazy idea</i>": Fly all the
developers into a central location and have a <b>debian conference</b>. Many
people would like to go to such an event and think it'd be a good thing for
Debian and a lot of fun. But of course, no one knows where we could find the
large amount of money this would take, or what could possibly be considered
a central location for such a distributed project.

<p>
Here's the <a
href="http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn091999.html">
Debian JP News</a> for this week. It includes an interesting "<i>virtual apt
server</i>" that generates packages apt requests, from a running Debian
system, using dpkg-repack.

<b>Followups</b> to last week's news:
</p>
<ul>
<li>In the wake of last week's changes to the Bug Tracking System, Darren
Benham posted a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01579.html">summary</a>
of the changes he's made so far. The biggest changs are that old fixed bugs are never
deleted anymore, they are archived, and that the BTS fully supports PGP/GPG signed
and mime formatted email.
<li>The Debian Quality Assurance <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">web site</a>
is up.
</ul>
