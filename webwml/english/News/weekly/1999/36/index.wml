<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Debconf has been released. Debconf is a configuration management tool that
lets Debian packages ask questions at install time using several different
UI's. Plain text, dialog, GTK and web UI's are currently supported, as well
as non-interactive intallations. It will support remote deatabases in the
future, allowing whole clusters of machines to be configured the same. Read
the <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg01500.html">
introduction to Debconf</a> for more information. Quite a few people are
eager to begin using it soon.
</p>

<p>
Corel has started a closed beta test of their Corel Linux distribution.
Unfortunatly, they did so under a very restrictive license, that 
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/20/1051226&mode=nested">
violates</a> the GPL in several respects. The good news is that Bruce Perens
has already contected Corel (19990920174008.6205.qmail@perens.com) and this will
be fixed.

The debian-laptop list has made a
<a href="http://www.snafu.de/~wehe/debian_linux.html">proposal</a> for
<b>making Debian more laptop friendly</b>. The idea is to create special laptop
kernels, plus a laptop meta package that pulls together everything a laptop
user needs. There seems to be "<i>no Linux distribution with a dedicated
laptop support</i>" yet, so Debian would be leading the way in this area.

<p>
<b>Should proftpd be moved to contrib for security reasons?</b> Many security
holes have been found it it lately and it seems likely more will show up in the
future, so some think it's a good idea to 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg01433.html">move it
out</a> of the main distribution. The maintainer prefers to 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg01434.html">wait
and see</a> what the situation is like when we freeze.
</p>

<p>
Joey Hess <a href="../../../..//Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9909/msg01283.html">
posted</a> what he confesses is a "<i>crazy idea</i>": Fly all the
developers into a central location and have a debian conference. Many people
would like to go to such an event and think it'd be a good thing for Debian
and a lot of fun. But of course, no one knows where we could find the large
amount of money this would take, or what could possibly be considered a
central location for such a distributed project. One thing that might help
us make informed decisions if this ever comes to pass is the developer
database, which now sports fields for entering your latitude and longitude.
Everyone's encouraged to go fill in your information at 
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">db.debian.org</a>. (Of course, the
information is already useful for generating nice xplanet maps ***LINK*** of
the developers.)
</p>

<p>
Here's the <a
href="http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn091999.html">
Debian JP News</a> for this week. It includes an interesting "<i>virtual apt
server</i>" that generates packages apt requests, from a running Debian
system, using dpkg-repack.
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to last week's news:
<ul>
<li>The Debian Quality Assurance <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">web site</a>
is up.
<li>in the wake of last week's changes the the Bug Tracking System, Darren
Benham posted a summary (E11STbZ-0004Ra-00@darren.benham.net) of the changes
he's made so far. The biggest changs are that old fixed bugs are never deleted
anymore, they are archived, and that the BTS fully supports PGP/GPG signed
and mime formatted email.
</ul>
