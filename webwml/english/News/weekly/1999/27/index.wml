<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="storm"></a>
<b>Storm Linux</b> is a new distribution 
<a href="http://stormix.com/">based on Debian</a>. Its
motto is "<i>Storm Linux: we make linux look good</i>", and it seems they do
-- take a look at these <a href="../../oldurl?http://stormix.com/about/screen_shots.html">
screenshots</a>. The developer of Storm is R Garth Wood, who has been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00632.html">active</a>
on debian-devel for a while. There has been little reaction to this
development though a report on a test install has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00685.html">posted</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="debianlogo"></a>
<b>The web site</b> now has a page for the 
<a href="../../../../ports/hurd/">Hurd port</a>. It covers installation,
development, etc. Speaking of the web site, it finally <b>uses the new
logo</b>. And the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00005.html">
results</a> are in for the logo swap vote: <b>the logos have been swapped</b>.
Go forth and use the swirl.
</p>

<p>
There's been an increasing amount of discussion about <b>freezing and release
plans</b> this week. From
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release-9907/msg00016.html">talk</a>
on the new debian-release list about shortening the release cycle to a discussion
about whether a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00907.html">September
release</a> is possible (with a freeze very soon), the idea is in the air.
</p>

<p>
Lalo Martins <a href="mail#1">posted</a> about <b>internationalizing Debian's
init scripts</b>. It's turning into a more general discussion about init script
output, see <a href="mail#2">this proposal</a> for example.
</p>

<p>
Here is a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9907/msg00746.html">
complete system</a> for <b>generating diffs between debian packages</b> and
applying those diffs. This could be used to "<i>seriously reduce download
times</i>"
</p>

<p>
As usual, we have some <a href="mail#3">news</a> from the <b>Debian-JP
project</b>. One thing they're dealing with is translating the copyright of
software that is documented only in Japanese.
</p>

<p>
<b>Many packages remain broken after the perl update.</b>
The
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9907/msg00007.html">
next planned step</a> is to file important bugs against these packages and
quickly make non maintainer releases of them.
</p>
