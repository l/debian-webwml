#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-8-29" SUMMARY="Developer sponsors; Debian-JP problems; general problems of Debian."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to the 33rd issue of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter
for the Debian developer community.
</p>

<p>
<a name="sponsor"></a>
Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01742.html">wrote</a>
that "<i>the sponsor idea has some success so I wrote a
<a href="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/">CGI
script</a> to keep track of people looking for sponsors</i>". Several people
chimed in with reports of the <b>success of the sponsor program</b>.
</p>

<p>
Dale Scheetz 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01880.html">posted</a>
about the trouble he's having. <b>To build libc,
he needs to first build packages ranging from X to perl.</b> This is a
good example of how tightly intertwined our source dependencies are, and of
how hard it can be to bootstrap a new port. It's unclear how or if these
problems will be solved, though having source dependencies available for
analysis might help. And it looks like source dependencies are going into
policy; there is a <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=41232">
consensus</a> on the policy list about how to do it.
</p>

<p>
Anyone who bought the first printing of "<i>Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to
Installation and Usage</i>" got a book with binary CD #2 in the back,
instead of CD #1 which is required to install Debian. <b>The publisher is aware
of the mistake</b> and is offering 
<a href="http://www.newriders.com/debian/badcd.html">free replacement CDs</a>.
</p>

<p>
CPU Review <a href="http://cpureview.com/rev_deb21_b.html">reviewed</a> 
Debian, with <b>mixed results</b>: "Debian 2.1r2 appears to be a technically
very solid distribution" but "The installation procedure MUST be simplified if
the Debian project wants to attract large numbers of new users".
</p>

<p>
<b>In security news</b>, a new version of epic4
was <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-99/msg00027.html">
released</a>, to fix a denial of service vulnerability. Debian's cron package
is <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-99/msg00028.html">
not vulnerable</a> to the buffer overflow found in Red Hat packages. It is
vulnerable, however, to an associated problem, and a fix has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-99/msg00029.html">
uploaded</a>. Holes have also been discovered in X, proftpd, and other ftp servers
this week, and the maintainers are working on the problem, though fixes have not yet
been uploaded. Also, Martin Schulze posted a draft
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01933.html">Debian
Security Policy</a>, which outlines the tasks of the security team and what they
can do to quickly get security problems fixed.
</p>

<p>
Anyone reading debian-devel lately has noticed many <b>Intent To Package
announcements from members of the Debian JP project</b>. Among these, there
has been a disturbing trend of "-ja" packages being made that are
existing packages (like mutt, jed, and slrn), with just a Japanese
internationalization patch applied. This trend culminated this week in the
ITP of grep-ja, and Wichert Akkerman
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01867.html">spoke
up</a> against the whole practice. "What I was hoping to see with the
integration of Debian-JP is that all the multibyte patches would be
*integrated* with Debian, not a senseless forking of lots of packages." And
with replies such as <a href="mail#1">this one</a> from Taketoshi Sano,
it seems that Debian-JP has gotten the message.
</p>

<p>
Adam Di Carlo 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01959.html">pointed
out</a> that this problem with Debian JP packages is just <b>another sort of fork</b>
-- and Debian has been accused before by "<i>some rather prominent people in the free
software world of having hidden forks in our packages</i>" -- most recently when it
turned out we had long ago fixed the cron security hole mentioned above, and the fix
had not reached all other distributions (note that cron is not maintained upstream,
so it couldn't be simply sent to the author).
</p>

<p>
And speaking of Debian-JP, as usual a news summary of what's been going on
in that project is available, from a 
<a href="http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn083099.html">
web site</a> this time.
</p>

<p>
<b>7 New packages</b> were added to Debian this week:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/doc/debian-guide.html">debian-guide</a>: Text from: Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/games/koth.html">koth</a>: King of the Hill
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/libs/libape1.html">libape1</a>: A Portable Environment for writing Threaded C++ services
(<a href="/Packages/unstable/devel/libape-dev.html">dev</a>)
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/base/libwrap0.html">libwrap0</a>: Wietse Venema's TCP wrappers library
(<a href="/Packages/unstable/devel/libwrap0-dev.html">dev</a>)
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/base/tcpd.html">tcpd</a>: Wietse Venema's TCP wrapper utilities
</ul>

<p>
<b>We'll close this week with something to think long and hard on.</b>
John Goerzen posted a very sobering
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01921.html">message</a>:
"<i>We have some serious problems. These are critical ones. It seems to
me that our organization is breaking down.</i>" He went on to list a variety
of problems, including release frequency, bugs that aren't being worked on,
the inconclusive debates about /usr/share/doc/, etc, and concluded, "<i>Where
is all our effort going? Flamewars and power struggles.</i>" John's message
is very much worth reading and thinking over; although people can
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9908/msg01966.html">refute</a>
specific points he made, the tone of his message and his conclusions match
what people are feeling right now.
