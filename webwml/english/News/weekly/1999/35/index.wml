#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-9-14" SUMMARY="A new BTS; broken packages; metapackages."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>In security news</b>, a buffer overflow in the inews program provided by
the INN news server has been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-99/msg00030.html">
reported</a> which would allow local users privileges as gid 'news'. New
versions of inewsinn, inn-dev and inn have been made available at
security.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
<a name="bts"></a>
<b>The Bug Tracking System has been upgraded to use the debbugs package</b>,
and Darren Benham is the <a href="mail#1">new maintainer</a> of the BTS. This
is very good news, because development has been going on in debbugs for some
time, and now the BTS will benefit from this and from future enhancements. The
BTS was down for a while this weekend for the transition; no mail was lost.

<p>
An
<a href="http://www.linuxcare.com/news_columns/interviews/1999/09-13-99.epl">
interview</a> with Matt Welsh contains some <b>interesting Debian-related
tidbits</b>. "<i>I was a member of the original Debian team. I invented dpkg,
or the first version of it, which looked nothing like what it looks like now</i>"
and "<i>They [Debian] are great idealists, but pragmatism sometimes has
to step in.</i>"
</p>

Raphaël Hertzog 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-9909/msg00013.html">posted</a> 
a <b>proposed structure for the QA group</b>. This includes a core QA team
and a web site to coordinate their work. The plan is to greatly expand what
the QA group works on, to include many things besides maintaining orphaned
packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>A few packages broke this week in unstable.</b> A new version of tar made
lintian <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00582.html">
very confused</a>; this has been fixed.
And a new netstd package split rsh into a separate package. That package is
still in Incoming, and until it reaches the archives, rsh isn't available.
<b>Other things happening in unstable this week</b> include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>The shadow suite now uses PAM.</b> This includes login, passwd, su, etc.
This is a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00613.html">
huge step</a> toward making everything use PAM.
<li>
<b>The long awaited redesign of the installation profiles has begun.</b> Now
there are "metapackages"; packages that depend on a group of packages that
relate to a common activity, like playing games or developing C programs. 
Martin Bialasinski posted a <a href="mail#2">request</a>
for help coming up with lists of packages for each metapackage.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Should Debian move to GRUB</b> as our
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00493.html">default
boot loader</a>? After all, since GRUB is used by the Hurd, this
would standardize the boot system used for Debian Linux and Debian Hurd.
Here is a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00501.html">good
summary</a> of pros and cons of using GRUB. Another con is that H. Peter
Anvin is working on a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00588.html">new
boot loader</a> for linux that promises to be superior to both. No conclusion
has been reached on this, but no-one seems especially attached to lilo.
</p>

<p>
<b>And speaking of the Hurd</b>, it's been a big week for the Hurd port, with 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-9909/msg00094.html">44 updated
packages</a>, along with a new set of installation files.
</p>

<p>
<b>Work on Debian JP continues</b> and as usual a 
<a href="http://www2.osk.3web.ne.jp/~shishamo/debian/trans/djwn/wn091299.html">
summary</a> is available, covering topics from internationalization to a
translated DFSG document, and work on a Social Contract for Debian JP.
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to last week's news:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The item about the <b>problems in BIND's copyright</b> was picked up by <a
href="http://lwn.net/1999/0909/">Linux Weekly News</a> and later by
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=99/09/11/1013245&amp;mode=nested">
SlashDot</a>. The maintainer of BIND began 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00585.html">talking
</a> with upstream about ways to resolve the problem, and it looks like a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00667.html">
solution</a> has been found -- a "bind-norsa" tarball will be available.
<li>Developers who want to migrate to GPG can read a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg00702.html">
mini-HOWTO</a> on the subject by Brian Almeida.
</ul>
