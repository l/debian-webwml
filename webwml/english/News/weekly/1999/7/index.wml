#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="February 15th, 1999" SUMMARY="Release date set"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to the seventh edition of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for
the Debian developer community. If this issue is a little slim, it's because
I spent most of yesterday attending Windows Refund Day instead of working on
it, and most of my contributors have been just as busy with other things. 
To split up the work load some more, <b>I'm looking for more contibutors</b>
to help with reading the lists and sending me summaries for this newsletter, 
<a href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">mail me</a> if you're interested.
</p>

<p>
<a name="release"></a>
If things go 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-9902/msg00011.html">
as planned</a>, <b>Debian 2.1 will be released on March 2nd</b>. This is very
good news, because to judge by traffic on the lists this week, everyone is
tired of being in the freeze.
</p>

<p>
Bob Hilliard is making slink's 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00446.html">
Release Notes document</a>. On a related note, the next boot-floppies upload
will probably be the last one for slink, since most bugs are resolved, and the
installation manual is almost done.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most substantial changes from hamm to slink include <b>alpha and
sparc architectures</b>. The sparc release is even more impressive because 
it is
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-9902/msg00064.html">
based on glibc2.1</a>. This means lots of bug fixes for packages that 
didn't work with glibc2.1 have already been made. The end result: other 
platforms will have a much easier time converting to glibc2.1. Experimental 
glibc2.1 packages are now available for i386 as well, and some i386 packages
were uploaded this week linked to that library. <b>Don't do that</b>; 
glibc 2.1 will not go into the i386 architecture of potato until after slink
is released.
</p>

<p>
If you're in Japan and would like to buy a <b>computer with Debian
pre-loaded</b>, you're in luck. "<i>
<a href="http://www.NikkeiBP.AsiaBizTech.com/Database/1999_Feb/08/Mor.02.gwif.html">
CUTE 2000</a>, an all-in-one Linux based server was exhibited at the NET &
COM '99 show. It is based on Debian GNU/Linux, and includes software for
functions such as DNS, WWW, SMTP, FTP, SAMBA, NETATALK, DHCP and others.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>In security news this week</b> it was announced to bugtraq that the super
package has a <a href="http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1999_1/0706.html">
buffer overrun hole</a>, a fix was uploaded for all versions of Debian a few
hours later. Also, the maintainer of cfengine discovered and fixed a
<a href="http://www.geek-girl.com/bugtraq/1999_1/0710.html">temporary
file security hole</a> in it, and the maintainer of grepmail 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-changes-9902/msg00944.html">
found and fixed</a> 2 security holes in that package.
Despite what you may read on <a href="http://www.lwn.net/">LWN</a>, <b>Debian
does take security very seriously.</b> It must be admitted that our security
web pages do continue to lag behind the latest fixes.
</p>

<p>
If you're thinking of <b>upgrading to a 2.2.x kernel</b>, check out 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~rcw/2.2/">rcw's kernel 2.2 checklist</a> for
an idea on what will break and what needs to be upgraded.
</p>

<p>
Some <a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg01172.html">
complaints</a> about the <b>instability of our gnome and gtk packages</b>
(which  tend to break everything that depends on them with each new release)
quickly led to a
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg01176.html">
useful idea</a>: form a <b>Debian gnome team</b>, which will coordinate making
consistent releases of all the gnome related packages. A
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg01281.html">
proposal</a> was made to this effect, and has met with acceptance from the
maintainers.
</p>

<p>
Due to licensing problems, the programs <tt>skill</tt> and <tt>snice</tt>
have been moved from procps into a new package named procps-nonfree. They will
probably be <a href="mail.html#1">dropped from Debian entirely</a> unless
people have a strong need for them.
</p>

<p>
<b>As if Debian's not big enough already</b>, there is now
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg01283.html">
some talk</a> of packaging E, wmaker, and gtk themes, and perhaps irc client
scripts. No one has any real objections to this happening, provided the
copyrights of the themes are ok.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/text/aspell.html">
aspell</a>, a more intelligent ispell replacement.

wmaker-kde</a> and 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/x11/wmaker-gnome.html">
wmaker-gmone</a>, versions of wmaker with support for those environments.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/zicq.html">zicq</a>,
yet another ICQ client.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/graphics/sketch.html">

<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/utils/uptimed.html">

</p>

<p>
<b>Server news</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Problems with non-us.debian.org continue.</b> There have been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00429.html">
offers</a> to move non-US to Australia, but nothing official has been done yet.
<li><b>va.debian.org</b> has been 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg01364.html">
upgraded to slink</a>. It's no longer being used as the gnome cvs archive,
so is mostly idle, and can be used to build packages.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to previous news items:
<ul>
<li>The cause of the <b>bug that makes cron switch to UTC time</b>
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9902/msg00954.html">

<li>
The <a href="../../oldurl?http://contest.gimp.org/view.cgi?month=1999-02">logo
submissions</a> in the Gimp contest <b>keep pouring in</b>; the number has
doubled from what was available last week. Here's a 
<a href="http://contest.gimp.org/view.cgi?month=1999-02&mode=show&graphic=idsfa-0">
good example</a>.
