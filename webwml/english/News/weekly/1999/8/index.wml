<p>
<strong>Welcome</strong> to the eighth edition of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for
the Debian developer community.
</p>

<p>
<strong>There's now a version of Debian translated into Italian.</strong>
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.prosa.it/prosa-debian/">PROSA Debian</a> is based on
slink, and is sold with a book
"<a href="http://www.mondolinux.com/cdroms/prosa.htm">Athena Linux</a>".
For more information see the <a href="mail#1">announcement</a>.
</p>

<p>
Linuxpower <a href="http://linuxpower.org/display_item.phtml?id=104">
interviewed</a> Wichert Akkerman. Definitely worth a read.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Bruce Perens</strong> is 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg01641.html">
moving away</a> from supporting the term "Open Source" and
returning to promoting "Free Software". "<q>Open Source has de-emphasized
the importance of the freedoms involved in Free Software. It's time for
us to fix that.</q>"
</p>

<strong>This month's Linux Journal</strong> contains three articles related to Debian.
One is about the <a href="http://linuxrouter.org/">Linux Router Project</a>, a
mini-distribution derived from Debian. The second describes 
<a href="http://millemiglia.ce.unipr.it">ARGO</a>, an autonomous car driven by
a computer running Debian. The last is by Andrew Feinberg, a Debian developer,
and is a general article about linux in a high school. Debian seems
to have quite a tradition of having high-school aged developers..

Someone
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg01630.html">
proposed</a> a <strong>Debian distribution based on FreeBSD</strong>. There was
considerable debate on this topic. Most of the favorable opinions expressed
were based on the argument that there should be a Debian distribution for as
many open source UNIX variants as possible. This was countered with the
argument that this would drastically increase the workload of the package
maintainers.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>final test build of the X packages</strong> is <a href="mail#3">
available</a> now, everyone who is able should test it. Also, X 3.3.3.1 is now
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg02010.html">
packaged</a> though not yet part of the distribution.

On a related note, the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-testing-9902/msg00145.html">
request</a> for a prompt for the default term type during xterm's
configuration has resurfaced. This would be nice for people in a
heterogeneous environment, and who therefore prefer xterm over xterm-debian
despite the disadvantages. For those interested, the reasoning for
xterm-debian as a default term type is at the bottom of Branden's
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~branden/">X Strike Force</a> page.
</p>

<p>
<strong>If you're wondering where all the .deb's for the arm architecture went</strong>,
they've
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg02084.html">
all been removed</a> from the archive. The arm port has broken binary
compatibility with those .deb's and has deleted them all and has started
building new ones.
</p>

<p>
Brian May has written a number of perl scripts which one might use to
configure and maintain <strong>NFS images for diskless clients</strong>.  He has
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg01983.html">
asked</a> whether these might be included in the Debian distribution.  There
are some problems that need to be resolved. For example how to compare two
packages for upgrades and calculating module dependencies when /lib/modules
is mounted as read-only.
</p>

<p>
Javier Fdz-Sanguino Pe&#241;a has written an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg01815.html">
article</a> on Slink for <a href="http://www.openresources.com">
Open Resources</a> and is asking for comments. Among other things,
this article discusses the problems that needed to be overcome for this
distribution and some of the issues involved with the gcc compiler upgrade.
</p>

<p>
It was a busy week for <strong>security holes</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Debian 2.0r5</strong> has been <a href="mail#2">released</a>, the contents
are primarily security fixes, but include some other bug fixes as well.
<li>A new version of mutt that fixes the <strong>mailcap security hole</strong> has been
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9902/msg01450.html">
released</a>. This isn't the end of that security hole, pine and other mailers
may still be vulnerable. A more general fix to mailcap is in the works.
<li>A <strong>buffer overflow problem in lsof</strong> is
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990220a">fixed</a>.
<li>A <strong>trivial root exploit</strong> was discovered in eterm and quickly
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990218">fixed</a>. It only
affected potato.
<li>The version of wget in slink and potato had an exploitable problem with
attempting to chmod symlinks, this has been
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/1999/19990220">fixed</a>.
<li>zgv has a security hole as well, reliable sources tell me the fix is in
Incoming.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>It's always a nice change of pace to meet fellow Debian developers face to
face.</strong> There were a couple of opportunities for this lately.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Nine developers, including Wichert Akkerman, Enrique Zanardi, and almost
every single developer in <tt>.nl</tt>, got together in <strong>Amsterdam</strong> last
week for dinner.
<li>
There was a Debian gathering in <strong>San Fransisco</strong>, on February 6th. Ian
Jackson and Dale Scheetz were in town, and several local Debian developers
and many users showed up for an impromptu meeting -- billed as the "<q>First
Ever Debian User's Group Meeting</q>". About 17 people attended in all. Some
summaries of the event can be found <a href="http://kitenet.net/~bad/">
here</a>.
</ul>

<p>
The <strong>next big chance to meet fellow developers</strong> will be at <a
href="http://www.linuxworldexpo.com/">LinuxWorld Expo</a> next week at the
Debian booth.
</p>

<p>
<strong>New packages</strong> added to Debian this week include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/utils/synaptics.html">
synaptics</a>, a configuration utility for the Synaptics TouchPad.
<li><a href="../../oldurl?http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/games/gnome-metatris.html">
gnome-metatris</a>, a themed gnome tetris.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/sound/gtick.html">

<li>An icecast 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/sound/icecast-server.html">
server</a> and 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/sound/icecast-client.html">
client</a>.
<li><a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/net/midentd.html">

<li>Also, a package of the security scanner
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9902/msg02047.html">
satan</a> is in incoming.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Help wanted</strong>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Havoc Pennington won't be able to work on gnome-apt for a while. He
has a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9902/msg01653.html">
list</a> of <strong>small, discrete tasks that others could help with</strong> in the
meantime.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Server news</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>An <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/">archive</a> of
all the <strong>old versions of Debian</strong> is now available. Only source is
available for some of the older versions.
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Followups</strong> to previous news items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Daniel Burrows
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9902/msg02340.html">
wrote a script</a> that <strong>automatically converts Windowmaker themes to
.deb's</strong>. Frozen Rose
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9902/msg02644.html">
posted</a> about a similar script, and a <strong>GTK-theme-to-deb converter</strong> as
well. These should eventually appear in a package.
</ul>

<p>
Many thanks to this week's contributors: Michael Dahlberg and Brandon
Mitchell.
