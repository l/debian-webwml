Debian Weekly News has summarized activities in the Debian project for the
past year. In this special edition of Debian Weekly News, we will review the
most important happenings of 1999 in the Debian world.
</p>

<p>
Some of the most important events in Debian in the last year have been tied
to votes by the Debian developers. This is a new thing, and it has worked
painlessly in some cases like the Project Leader elections, in other cases,
like the long process of picking a new logo and license, it has been perhps
more of a hinderance than a help. (** MOVE? **)
</p>

<b>January</b>

<p>
We've made one major release and 5 minor releases of Debian this past year
and are rapidly approaching another freeze. At this time last year, deep in
the interminable freeze for Debian 2.1, we are beginning to wonder if
the freeze would ever end, and we are having some
<a href="1#skip_slink">second thoughts</a> about our plans for the release.
We keep on working though, going into a deep freeze in late January.
</p>

<p>
For the first time a minimal Debian GNU/Hurd system becomes available, based
on the Debian base system. (issue #2)
</p>

<p>
The first tenative work begins on support for build dependancies in source
packages. (#2, #3)
</p>

<p>
Elections begin for the new Debian Project Leader. This is the first time
we choose a leader in this way, and it is an exciting process that luckily
doesn't become too political.
</p>

<p>
The Debian logo had a temporary license with a time-limit in it. The license
expired kept expiring, but nothing was being done to draft a perminant
license, and we just kept pushing back the expire date. Finally, we get sick
of this state of affairs, and decide to look for a new logo via Gimp logo
contest. (#4)
</p>

<b>February</b>

<p>
Dpkg development, long stalled, resumes, with automatic upload announcments
and automatic bug closing enabled when packages are uploaded. Several other
people promise to do some work on dpkg soon. (#5)
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman is elected Debian's new leader. (#6)
</p>

<p>
Use of debhelper hits the 50% mark. (#6)
</p>

<p>
Work on the release continues, and a release date of March 2nd is set. (7)
</p>

<p>
The idea of a version of Debian based on FreeBSD is raised for the first
time. (8)
</p>

<b>March</b>

<p>
The release is delayed for one week because of a few last minute bugs being
found. Some last minute confusion ensued as people don't hear about the
delay in time, and a party on IRC celebrates the release prematurely.
In the rocky last few days before the release, tensions rise, and some
unforunate incidents make Brian White resign from being Release Manager. (#9)
</p>

<p>
The Gimp logo contest ends, and we prepare to vote on the logo, while still
trying to decide what license to use for it.
</p>

<p>
Finally, on March 9th, Debian 2.1 is released. (#10)
</p>

<p> 
Debian is used in the Empeg in-car mp3 player. (#10) 
</p>

<p>
With Debian released, another giddy round of development begins. The first
task is migrating to glibc 2.1. (#11)
</p>

<b>April</b>

<p>
Four candidate logos are chosen. We begin considering the idea of having two
logos; one for official and one for liberal use. (#14) Voting on the number
of logos and their licenses eventually begins. (#16)
</p>

<p>
Corel announces they will create a Linux distribution based on Debian. (#17)
</p>

<p>
The Bug Tracking System goes down when an ancient a.out binary in it breaks.
This serves as a wake up call about how unmaintained the Bug Tracking System
is. (#17)
</p>

<b>May</b>

<p>
The results on of the logo license vote come in; we will have two logos with
different licenses. (#18)
</p>

<p>
Discussion on the debian-policy mailing list becomes more active, and weekly
policy summaries begin to be posted. (#18)
</p>

<p>
The Debian JP project releases a Japanese version of slink and indicates it
wants to become part of Debian proper and merge their changes into Debian.
(#19) Several people from Debian JP become Debian developers, and begin
adding packages to Debian. (#22)
</p>

<p>
A new server for non-us is put up, ending the long sporadic chain of
problems with the old server. At the same time, non-us is reorganized to
more closely match the layout of the rest of Debian. (#19)
</p>

<p>
Voting on the new Debian logo begins. (#20)
</p>

<p>
Configuration management, which had been discussed a lot the previous fall,
and a specification written, resurfaces with two separate configuration
management systems appearing. (#21)
</p>

<b>June</b>

<p>
The new Debian logo is selected with the "swirl" winning. It begins to be
rapidly adopted by the Debian community. But the logo saga isn't over yet; a
proposal is made to switch the official and liberal use logos. (#23)
</p>

<p>
SPI becomes an official US non-profit. (#23)
</p>

<p>
After a lot of work, perl 5.005 starts to be introduced into Debian. The
perl upgrade affects a great many packages, and turns out to be rather
painful. Some infrastructure is put in place to make future perl upgrades
easier by letting several versions of perl coexist on a single system. (#24)
** Actually, move this to #26, in july ****
</p>

<p>
A new Debian book titled 
<i>Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage</i> is published. (#25)
</p>

<p>
Yet another logo vote is called for, to see if the official and liberal use
logos should be switched. (#25)
</p>

<b>July</b>

<p>
A major new revision of Debian policy is released. It mandates
FHS compliance. This raises the question of how to migrate from /usr/doc to
/usr/share/doc. (#26)
</p>

** Up to: 27 **
