<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9911/msg00013.html">
posted</a> the <b>Debian Machine Usage Policy</b>, a comprehensive description
of what is and is not acceptable use of Debian project machines by developers.
It was greeted with mixed feelings; some people feel this is an 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00027.html">unnecessary
document</a>, and expect people to just do the right thing. Others think the
project has gotten too big to not have a usage policy of this sort in place,
and point out that it has in fact been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9911/msg00034.html">violated</a>
in the past.
</p>

<p>
<b>Another bugsquash party will be held this weekend.</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9911/msg00021.html">Participate</a>
on Saturday and help us "<i>splatter bug juice all over the dist!</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>Three security fixes were released this week:</b> A new version of BIND has
been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-9911/msg02035.html">released</a>
that fixes a remote root exploit. The security fixes were also
<a href="mail#1">backported to stable</a>. Also, a
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991111a">new version of
proftpd</a> for stable has been released, fixing a number of security holes.
And finally, a fix for a nfs-server buffer overflow has been
<a href="../../../../security/1999/19991111">released for stable</a>.
</p>

<p>
Vincent Renardias has made <a href="mail#2">available</a> a <b>Y2K update for
Slink</b>, with fixes for every known Y2K problem in Slink except a small Y2K
problem in nethack (which still has no known fix).
</p>

<p>
<a name="corel"></a>
<b>Corel Linux has been released.</b> A few developers have looked at it and
given some initial opinions which range from "<i>the feeling I get is not of
a new operating system, but of a stripped-down Debian with KDE, and some more
flashy graphics</i>" to "<i>it will make a great desktop to keep users happy
and debian under the bonet to keep us admins happy</i>". The important
point is that is is a Debian system with <a href="mail#3">few modified
packages</a>, and apt-get and dpkg continue to work.
</p>

<p>
<b>A new "<i>science</i>" section has been added to the ftp site</b> alongside
the existing sections like mail and games. Anyone who maintains packages that
belong in the new section should <a href="mail#4">contact James Troup</a>.
</p>

The Bug Tracking System has
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/db/ix/summary.html">passed</a> the <b>50,000
bug mark</b>. A bit more than 8 thousand of those bugs remain open, so
Debian has fixed over 41 thousand bugs. Good work, everyone.
</p>

<p> 
<b>Some Debian merchandise is available at Copyleft.</b> No shirts yet, but they 
have nice <a href="http://copyleft.net/cgi-bin/copyleft/d001.pl">black</a> 
and <a href="http://copyleft.net/cgi-bin/copyleft/d002.pl">white</a> 
frisbees with the Debian logo on them. 
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html">ton of new 
packages</a> were added to Debian this week, with the new larger archive
maintainence team working hard to get new packages into Debian in record time.
