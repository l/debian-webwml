<b>Welcome</b> to the fifth edition of Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for
the Debian developer community. Debian Weekly News has been in publication
for a month now. How are we doing? <a href="mailto:joeyh@debian.org">Write to
the editor</a> and let us know what parts of the newsletter you like best, and
what needs improvement.
</p>

<p>
Attention all developers: 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/1999/vote_0001">Elections</a> for Debian
project leader close on the 3rd; <b>hurry up and vote</b> if you haven't
already. Just don't <a href="mail#1">vote like Netgod</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://contest.gimp.org/">gimp contest</a> for <b>new Debian
logos</b> <a href="mail#2">has begun</a>. It will run for one month, then a
<a href="mail#3">5 person logo team</a> will weed out the best logos for the
rest of Debian to vote on.
<i>"The winner will be awarded an email-address at debian.org, a CD-set
with Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 for the architectures of his/her choice (alpha,
i386, m68k, or sparc) and ever-lasting fame for creating the one and only
Debian logo-set."</i>
</p>

<p>
<b>Development of dpkg</b> will soon begin again. Ian Jackson says he plans
to get to work on it once he's no longer project leader. Guy Maor 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-dpkg-9901/msg00149.html">
intends</a> to do some work on it, and long MIA Klee Dienes has
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-dpkg-9901/msg00162.html">
re-surfaced</a> and is looking for some dpkg coding tasks to work on too. Guy
has already implemented a
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02650.html">
nice new feature</a>: When a new experimental dpkg-dev
package is used, dinstall (the program that installs packages onto the ftp
site) can now <b>announce package uploads</b> to the correct list, and <b>close
bugs</b> fixed by those uploads.
</p>

<p>
There have been suggestions to clean up <b>dselect's access methods</b>. One
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-9901/msg00217.html">
suggestion</a> is to take out harddisk, mounted, cdrom, and nfs; either 
removing them entirely or splitting them into a separate package. This
would prevent some of the confusion newbies experience when they first use
dselect, at least until they get to the package selection part.
</p>

<p>
Of course, the ultimate end to dselect confusion is apt; and <b>gnome-apt</b>,
the <b>GUI front end to apt</b>, has finally been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02402.html">
released</a> as a .deb. "<i>Who says package management can't be Sexy?</i>".
It's available <a href="http://www.debian.org/~hp/gnome-apt.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The long awaited X packages have been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-changes-9901/msg02183.html">
released</a> to frozen, and they sport the <b>longest Debian changelog entry
ever</b>, weighing in at an impressive 189 lines. (This has been 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02490.html">
verified</a> by a scan of the entire distribution.) In other X news, Stephen 
Crowley
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02195.html">
plans</a> to package RedHat's Xconfigurator as part of Debian.
</p>

<p>
A <a href="http://www.hams.com/OSD.html">draft chapter</a> of the O'Reilly
book <i><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/">Open 
Sources</a></i> mentions Debian in several places. The chapter is written by
Bruce Perens and describes the <b>Open Source Definition</b>. <i>"the Debian
Free Software Guidelines were the right document to define Open Source"</i>
</p>

<p>
Darren Benham is
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-www-9901/msg00064.html">
searching</a> for new <b>software for list archiving</b>. Hopefully, it will
support pgp/MIME signatures, and it must be DFSG-free.
Among other problems, the current list archiving software used on the
Debian web site <a href="mail#4">has a Y2K problem</a>. And speaking of 
<b>Debian and Y2K</b>, we now have a
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~csmall/y2k.html">Y2K web page</a>.
</p>

<p>
And last but not least, the longest thread on the lists this week was a
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02245.html">
frustrating dialog</a> with the author of libtool about its use of
<b>-rpath</b>. Many developers agree this is a bad idea for linux systems;
the libtool author disagrees. After arguing in circles for days, we haven't
quite reached a resolution, but a <b>hack of ld.so</b> is looking likely 
instead of a change to libtool.
</p>

<p>
<b>Help wanted</b>:
<ul>
<li>If you notice your <b>cron running jobs at the wrong time of day</b>, you
can help the maintainer track down the cause of this problem by doing a little
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02311.html">
experiment</a>.
<li>Several applications <b>linked statically to gettext</b> need to be
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/28850">recompiled</a>. There's a security 
hole involved. If you maintain a package that uses gettext, check it out.
<li>Work on <a href="http://www.net.lut.ac.uk/psst/">lsh</a>, the <b>free
ssh clone</b> is progressing, but help is still needed. Non-US
developers are
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg02030.html">
asked to participate</a>, since they are able to hack on crypto code, but
those from the US can still contribute by other means.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to previous news items:
<ul>
<li>The Zope license has been
<a href="http://www.zope.org/News?query_start=1">changed</a> and is now
DFSG free.
</ul>
