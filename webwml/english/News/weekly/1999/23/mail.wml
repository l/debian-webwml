-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

We have received reports that the version of the imap suite
in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 has a vulnerability in its POP-2 daemon,
which can be found in the ipopd package. Using this vulnerability
it is possible for remote users to get a shell as user "nobody"
on the server.

We recommend you upgrade your ipopd package immediately.

wget url
        will fetch the file for you
dpkg -i file.deb
        will install the referenced file.

Linus Torvalds to Headline Benefit Dinner for Debian Project

Linuxcare, VA Linux Systems to Sponsor Event at Upcoming BALUG
Meeting

June 7, 1999  Linus Torvalds, creator of the Linux operating
system, will headline a benefit dinner for the Debian Project,
developers of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, on Tuesday, June
15, at the monthly meeting of the Bay Area Linux Users
Group (BALUG).

The dinner will be held at the Four Seas Restaurant in San
Francisco's Chinatown district; reservation and other information
can be found at http://www.balug.org/. Because seating is
limited, guests are urged to register early using the BALUG
Web site. Contributions to the benefit, which also covers the
cost of the meal exclusive of beverages, are $10 per person. 

The Debian Project is an international group of Open Source
software developers who collectively produce Debian GNU/Linux,
one of the major distributions of the Linux operating system.
Unlike other Linux distributors, such as Red Hat Software, the
Debian Project is wholly non-profit.

"The Debian Project perfectly exemplifies the spirit of Open
Source development," Torvalds said. "Debian's non-commercial
Linux distribution shows again that Internet-enabled, cooperative
software development can produce software of the very highest
quality." 

Two Linux industry leaders--Linuxcare, Inc., and VA Linux
Systems--are co-sponsoring the Debian benefit in coordination
with BALUG. The two companies will underwrite a $10 contribution
to the Debian Project for every person who attends the June 15
dinner; at least several hundred persons are anticipated to be on
hand. The Debian Project (https://www.debian.org) operates under
the auspices of Software in the Public Interest, Inc. (SPI), a
non-profit, 501(c) corporation. SPI can be found on the Web at
https://www.spi-inc.org/.

Windows Refund Day activities in February 1999. The BALUG
membership meets every third Tuesday of the month at the Four
Seas Restaurant in San Francisco. Visit http://www.balug.org/ for

Bonzai 1, Doubletree.

Hope to see people there...
