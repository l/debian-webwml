#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PAGENAME="January 18th, 1999" SUMMARY="DPL elections; data bloating Debian; mutt a standard mail reader?"

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to the third edition Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for
the Debian developer community. Overall it's been a slow week, but there's
still a fair amount of interesting things happening. However, a great
deal of it is <b>behind the scenes</b>, on the debian-private mailing list
and I cannot summarize it here. A plea to everyone: <b>please think before
posting to debian-private</b>; debian-devel is usually a better choice.
</p>

<p>
This 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg01304.html">
just in</a>: <b>slink will enter deep freeze</b> on Wednesday, January 20th!
9 packages will be removed from the distribution due to critical bugs unless
they are fixed immediately; 36 other critical bugs must be fixed before we
release.
</p>

<p>
<a name="elections"></a>
<b>Elections</b> for the next Debian project leader have begun. Elections will 
remain open for 3 weeks, closing on February 3rd. The 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-announce-9901/msg00017.html">
ballot</a> lists 4 candidates: Ben Collins, Joseph Carter, Richard Braakman,
and Wichert Akkerman. For more information about the candidates, see Lalo
Martins' <a href="http://www.debian.org/~lalo/">interview</a>.
Of course, only Debian developers can 
<a href="http://vote.debian.org/1999/vote_0001">vote</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a name="data"></a>
This topic has come up before on the lists but we've not yet found a
solution. What is Debian to do when someone wants to package up
<b>hundreds of megabytes of free data</b> as part of Debian? This time
around it's some 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-mentors-9901/msg00051.html">
astronomical data</a>, but biological data, map data, etc, have come up in the
past. Such huge packages could require Debian to <b>expand onto yet another
CD</b>, for data sets that are useful to only a small number of people. 
</p>

<p>
Another interesting question 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg01088.html">
raised on the lists</a> this week: <b>should mutt become the standard Debian
mail reader</b>? Elm is currently our standard mail reader. The small amount of 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg01119.html">
information</a> we have so far from the popularity-contest package indicates
that mutt is used more than elm, at least by Debian developers. But elm is
more standard on unix systems as a whole than the upstart mutt, and is easier
for a new user to configure.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Open Group</b> has released their first LSB compliance
<a href="http://ct.us.mirrors.freshmeat.net/news/1999/01/18/916679929.html">
test suite</a>.
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg01281.html">
Reaction</a> so far on the lists has been <b>very negative</b>, both 
concerning the scope of the test suite and the actual substance of it (for
instance, it appears to contain i386isms). Joseph Carter is 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg01285.html">
compiling a list</a> of these problems so we can bring them to The Open
Group's attention.
</p>

<p>
It looks like we are adding the <b>tecra boot floppies</b> back because a few
people
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-9901/msg00130.html">
reported problems</a> with the latest boot floppies and laptops.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian Hurd</b> is the only port people who own just i386 hardware can work
on. The Hurd port is in that interesting point it its development where it's
right on the edge of being usable. If you're interested in dealing with this 
up-and-coming port, there's a list of
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-hurd-9901/msg00101.html">
tasks</a> to work on. Of course the Hurd
has some interesting new developments in it; one of these is the ability to
<b>mount multiple filesystems in the same namespace</b>. That ability makes the
deep directory tree used by the FSSTND unnecessary. There's been a 
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-hurd-9901/msg00081.html">
long discussion</a> on the debian-hurd mailing list this week about linking
/usr to / on hurd systems, to allow a flatter directory tree while still
preserving compatibility with the rest of Debian. Interesting stuff.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian sparc</b> has finally been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-sparc-9901/msg00010.html">
frozen</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Package releases</b> this week include:
<ul>
<li>For all those interested in <b>XFree86 3.3.3</b>, Ben Gertzfield
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-9901/msg00125.html">
posted</a> that the Debian JP group has made their own 3.3.3 packages. 
They can be found at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.or.jp/debian-jp/dists/unstable-jp/main/binary-i386/x11/">
ftp.debian.or.jp</a>. Your mileage may vary, but it may be something to 
try before pulling you hair out when the binaries from the XFree86 group 
give you problems. 
<li>Another version of the <b>cd creation scripts</b> has been
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-testing-9901/msg00131.html">
released</a> at the 
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~stevem/DebianCD/">usual place</a>.
This set features the ability to install from a tree of 
symlinks enabling people to create cd's using multiple hard drives or over 
nfs mounted mirrors. The next version of these scripts will probably have more
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-cd-9901/msg00058.html"> 
support for the other ports</a>. 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Packages in trouble</b> this week:
<ul>
<li>A severe <a href="../../oldurl?http://bugs.debian.org/31627">security hole</a> was
found in the design of the ftpwatch package. Since the problem is with the
design of the program, the only fix is a complete rewrite, so <b>ftpwatch will
be pulled from Debian</b>.
<li>The version of 
<a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/">debhelper</a> in potato had
a minor bug in its support of the menu package. The bug only triggers on
rare occasions, but it is in any packages that use the menu system
and were built with debhelper versions 1.2.21 or 1.2.22. If you maintain
such a package you should <b>rebuild it with the fixed version of
debhelper</b>.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Server news</b> this week:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://bugs.debian.org">bug tracking system</a> has a 
<b>new easy way to get to a given bug report</b>. 
<i>http://bugs.debian.org/foo</i> will pull up the bug report for package foo;
<i>http://bugs.debian.org/nnnn</i> will pull up a given bug by number.
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.br.debian.org">ftp.br.debian.org</a> is up, a new
official Debian mirror for <b>Brazil</b>.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>Followups</b> to news items from last week:
<ul>
<li>Ben Collins
<a href="../../../../Lists-Archives/debian-devel-9901/msg00991.html">
released</a> a new version of the <b>source depends code</b>, "<i>a full
blown implementation (not to be confused with a hack)</i>". It includes
versioned dependencies.
</ul>
