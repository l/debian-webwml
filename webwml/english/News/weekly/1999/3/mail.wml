Subject: Debian v2.1 ("Slink") Deep Freeze



		     Debian v2.1 ("Slink") Deep Freeze


After considerable delay, Slink is almost ready for release.  As such, it
will go into the "deep freeze" on Wednesday, January 20th.  New uploads
will be _greatly_ restricted.  Also, the following packages will be
removed because of release-critical bugs still open against them:

ftpwatch          31627  ftpwatch: trivial root exploit
grail             31905  grail never starts (lengthy mail)

licq              31614  licq: licq reads from the console when started from the menus!
newscache         26057  newscache: Access control not compiled in
pilot-link        31806  pilot-link: Can't build from source

snd               30941  snd does not work with slink version of lesstif

If you have any objections to this list, please email me immediately.  Also,
the following packages will hold up the final release because of release-
critical bugs against them.

If you would like to help speed the release of the next Debian distribution,
you are encouraged to take part in fixing these bugs.  More information about
them can be found on Debian's web page:  http://www.debian.org/Bugs/

The official release date is yet unset, but with luck it can be as
early as the end of January.  More likely, though, is mid-February.

Indeed. I thought LSB was going to be an Application Environment
specification - so that apps developed on one distribution would run on all
the others.

If that's still the case, I wanna know WTF they are thinking/smoking,
specifying kernel locations, netstat, mount/umount, fdisk, setserial,
disktab, adjtime, csh.login (!), fdprm, fstab, gettydefs (!!!), group,
passwd, inittab, lilo, mtab, profile, securetty, exports, hosts,
hosts.allow, hosts.deny, networks, printcap, protocols, services, rpc,
/home, /lib/modules, /opt existing (conflicts with FHS), /root, clock,
getty, init, update, mkswap, swapon, swapoff, telinit, shutdown, fsck, mkfs,
ifconfig, route, /tmp cleaning, /usr/X386 (?!?), includes, g++,
/usr/local/*, process accounting, utmp (ALL programs should use the
wrapper), /var/spool/lpd, rwho, /var/tmp persistance, NIS, ALL OF THE DAMN
MAJOR/MINOR NUMBERS FOR THE DEVICES, /usr/src, /usr/src/linux, compilers...

*NO* well-behaved application should use/twiddle/tinker with ANY of the
above. (Well, I could be wrong in a couple spots, but... wow.)

P.S.: From where is /bin/domainname standard? I can see it's purpose in an
app env standard, so I'm curious...

Subject: Re: LSB?

It has come to my attention that recent decisions made by the Linux
Standard Base body (I hesitate to say "committee" as I have never been
party to any of their internal discussions and am unaware of their
internal organizational structrure) are possibly unwise and have been
determined by at least a few individuals as A Bad Thing.  Particularly
worth note are several i386isms and other things which those who have
spoken already feel are oversights with potentially disasterous results.

Reasonable objection notwithstanding, I intend to write a letter to those
responsible for the LSB to attempt to raise the issues we have with their
current proposal.  I would appreciate discussion on these issues in other
parts of this thread.  I encourage those who have a significant opinion
not yet voiced in the LSB thread found on debian-devel to write them down
either as part of the thread or directly to me to aid in the drafting of
this letter.
