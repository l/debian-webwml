<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
The <b>Atlanta Linux Showcase</b> was the event of the week. Here's a report
from Joey Hess:<br>
<blockquote>Debian was everywhere at the Atlanta Linux Showcase, from the two 
Debian books on the show floor, to the Debian 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~doogie/als/pics/debian-commercial-box.jpg">
boxed set </a> being handed out at VA's
booth, to frisbees and rub-on tatoos emblazoned with the Debian logo. Of
course, Debian had a booth there as well, with a webcam and examples of
Debian running on hardware ranging from a NeXT box to Sparcs. The boxed set
and other merchandising of Debian generated a lot of interest in us. The
developers attending included some real old-timers, and we had some very
good late night talks.</blockquote>
Zephaniah "Mercury" Hull <a href="http://lwn.net/1999/features/ALS/">won
the NeXT</a> from Novare for successfully getting Linux to run on the box, and 
pictures from ALS 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~doogie/als/pics/">are available</a>.</p>

<p>
Some concerns <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00844.html">
were raised</a> about the <b>size of boot floppies</b> for potato.
Apparently, the base tarball for installation is some 15MB. The boot
floppies team is working hard on making sure that, for most people, it will
not be necessary to make 16 floppies for a potato install.
</p>

<p>
Along similar lines, there are 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01162.html">complaints</a>
that <b>very large data packages</b> should not be placed in
the archive. A 47MB package (gmt-coast-full) was recently uploaded. The
Debian archive is currently about 10G, and growing rapidly. There are
worries that we will lose many mirrors if it continues to grow at its current
rate.
</p>

<p>
A <b>new version of dpkg</b> 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg00852.html">
was uploaded</a> by our fearless leader, which includes fixes from Ben Collins
for some long-standing bugs.
</p>

<p>
<b>Several packages were renamed</b> this week, causing some confusion.
The lesstif package has been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01038.html">renamed</a>
to lesstif1. The qt1/qt2 packages have been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01139.html">renamed</a>
to libqt1/libqt2. The bzip2 package has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01065.html">split</a>
into bzip2 and libbz2. Some packages are still broken because of these
changes.
</p>

<p>
A new <b>finger interface to the developers' directory</b> was
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01120.html">announced</a>.
This will mostly be useful for obtaining developers' GPG/PGP keys. 
finger help@db.debian.org for usage instructions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Some interesting proposals</b> this week:
<ul>
<li>Wichert Akkerman <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9910/msg00003.html">posted</a>
a proposal for handling new maintainer applications;
<li>Matt Porter <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-9910/msg00431.html">suggested
replacing dselect with console-apt</a> on the boot
floppies. The general consensus seems to be that while console-apt is really
cool, it still lacks some important features before it will be really useful.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> in Debian this week include the following and 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs-19991018.html">132
more</a>:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/electronics/bottlerocket.html">bottlerocket</a>: Utility to control X10 Firecracker devices
<li><a href="../../oldurl?/Packages/unstable/base/gnumach.html">gnumach</a>: The GNU version of the Mach microkernel
  (<a href="../../oldurl?/Packages/unstable/devel/gnumach-dev.html">dev</a>)
<li><a href="/Packages/unstable/libs/libvdkbuilder.html">libvdkbuilder</a>: Pluggin libraries bundled with VDKBuilder (4 days new)
  (<a href="/Packages/unstable/devel/libvdkbuilder-dev.html">dev</a>)
</ul>

<p>
This issue of DWN was put together by Randolph Chung.
Joey Hess will be back next week.
