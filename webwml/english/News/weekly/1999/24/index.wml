<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community. This is a special two week combined issue since I was unable to
publish last week. I am now looking for a
<a href="../../contributing#subeditor">substitute editor</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the wake of the logo vote, a few developers have <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00703.html">
surfaced</a> who didn't hear about the vote until the results were announced
and are understandably upset about not getting a chance to vote. This
perhaps points to a larger problem: though all developers are supposed to
subscribe to debian-devel-announce, not all do. So <b>there is no way to
ensure every developer sees an announcement</b>. One fix that's been
discussed is auto-subscribing all developers to debian-devel-announce.
Debian Weekly News encourages anyone who wants to make sure they don't miss
this type of thing in the future to at least read DWN regularly.
</p>

<p>
Wichert Akkerman has proposed <b>splitting non-free and contrib out to a new
server</b>, <tt>nonfree.debian.org</tt>. The impetus for this is to emphasize
that they are not part of Debian, since "<i>the distinction isn't as visible
as it used to be; advances in searching in the distribution and tools like
apt make it very hard to see when something is in main and when not</i>".
The proposal will come up for a vote soon and is generating lots of
discussion.

<b>The issue of signing debs has come up again.</b> Interestingly, Wichert
Akkerman <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01438.html">
says</a> that "<i>we will support multiple verification methods within a year</i>"
(presumably this is related to the dpkg v2 project). Manoj Srivastava posted a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01428.html">good
overview</a> of the security issues related to signing packages and some
workarounds.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of security, a <b>new version of man-db that fixes a symlink
attack</b> has been <a href="http://lwn.net/1999/0617/a/debman-db.html">
released</a>.
</p>

<p>
Dale Scheetz posted to debian-private (reposted <a href=mail#1>here</a> with
his permission) about the problems with Official Debian CD's. "<i>Having an
Official CD has not stopped the delivery of broken CDs, and it doesn't protect
the vendor either.</i>" To help rectify this, he proposes sending CD's to
testers before publicly releasing them, and also setting up a process that
will let CD vendors put patches and other changes on the CD's and still call
them "Official".
</p>

<p>
Joost Witteveen, author of the menu package, has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9906/msg00370.html">released
version 2.0</a> of that package, which incorporates a <b>neat new concept:
hints</b>. Read his post for details, but this should allow menu to optimize
the menu hierarchy it generates so there are no over-full or under-full menus.
</p>

<p>
The APT team has released a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01459.html">new
version of APT</a>. The most interesting new feature is <b>support for
downloading the sources of packages</b>. With a "--compile" switch, apt can
even launch a build of the package!
</p>

<p>
<b>A perl update.</b>
<a href="ftp://ftp.daft.com/pub/debian/experimental/">Packages of perl
5.005</a> are finally 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-9906/msg00020.html">
ready for testing</a>. Maintainers of perl modules and other interested
parties should read the new
<a href="http://pandora.debian.org/~hertzog/perl-policy.txt">perl policy</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Debian events</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Both Ian Jackson and James Troup will be speaking</b> at the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg01233.html">Linux '99
Conference</a> in the UK. It's on the 25th and 26th.
<li><b>The Philadelphia Debian GNU/Linux User's Group</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9906/msg00954.html">met</a> on
the 16th. The meeting topic was "<i>An Overview of Debian Policy</i>"
(DWN apologizes for not publicizing this in time for the meeting.)
<li><b>About $7000 was donated to Debian</b> by LinuxCare and VA at the <a
href="http://kitenet.net/auto/pipermail/bad/1999-June/000213.html">Debian
benefit</a>. There were also a few posters given out by LinuxCare that are
similar to a certain other infamous poster.
</ul>

<p>
On debian-policy there was a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-9906/msg00313.html">
discussion</a> <b>about the undocumented.7 man page</b> and whether it's
really useful at all. Some feel that "<i>The undocumented(7) link is not only
useless, but actively annoying.</i>"
</p>

<p>
<b>A few tidbits from the Debian JP project.</b> Debian JP is doing a
survey of use of their packages, results 
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.debian.or.jp/~maehara/popcon/">here</a>. It seems that
their announcement of plans to merge with Debian backfired a little bit with
people thinking the project had quit. In fact their work on Japanese
localized packages continues.
</p>

<p>
<b>Server news</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>John Goerzen has 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-9906/msg00081.html">set
up</a> a <b>wanna-build database and an autobuilder for the Debian Alpha
port</b>.
</ul>
