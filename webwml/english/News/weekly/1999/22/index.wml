#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="1999-5-31" SUMMARY="Configuration management implementations; Debian JP merge."

<p>
<b>Welcome</b> to Debian Weekly News, a newsletter for the Debian developer
community.
</p>

<p>
<b>Configuration management</b>, a way to store answers to install-time
questions in a database for use later, is an idea that has been floating
around for a long time. There have been detailed specifications, like 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/~wakkerma/config6/">Wichert's proposal</a>.
However, until recently, this was all vaporware. Recently, <b>two
mostly-complete implementations of configuration management systems</b>
have <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg01900.html">
appeared</a>. Neither of these are as complete as the as the old proposal.
However, they have one big thing going for them: they are a "<i>small hack
which is actually implemented</i>", not a "<i>ideal hack which has been
debated for years and never implemented</i>".
</p>

<p>
An <a href="http://www.techsightings.com/cgi-bin/ts_review.pl?317">article</a>
about Linux Expo paints a <b>clear picture of the Debian presence there</b>:
"<i>The Debian booth didn't even have chairs; everyone sat cross-legged on the
floor. But Debian had the best hats and the best music, and among those who made
the Debian booth their De facto home base at LinuxExpo were several celebrated
free software programmers and hackers</i>". It also features quotes of
developer Sean Perry. But the depressing side of this article is its discussion
of the <b>highly corporate nature of the Expo and the marginalization of the
Free Software community there</b>. "<i>The forlorn groups hidden away back on
poverty row were Linux when Linux wasn't cool</i>"
</p>

<p>
That ties in with a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg01487.html">thread</a>
DWN missed last week, a discussion about <b>whether Debian should spend money
on booths at these trade shows</b>. Most people think a small booth in the
back is sufficient, so long as there are plenty of free CD's to give away.
</p>

<p>
<b>A Debian slide show</b> is <a href="mail#mail1">under development</a>. The
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~rgmerk/prespage.html">
first version</a> is aimed at Linux newbies.
</p>

<p>
<b>The Debian JP project continues to merge more packages into Debian.</b> Here
is a 
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.debian.or.jp/Lists-Archives/debian-devel/199905/msg00411.html">
rather frightening long list</a> of packages they intend to add. DWN was also
told that the term of office of the Debian JP steering team has expired and
elections are beginning.
</p>

<p>
<b>New packages</b> added to Debian this week include the following and
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html">33 more</a>, many of
them GNOME-related:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/apcupsd">apcupsd</a>: APC UPS Power Management
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/editors/august">august</a>: Tcl/Tk HTML editor.
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/cdcd">cdcd</a>: Command line or console based CD player
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/otherosfs/gcombust">gcombust</a>: GTK+ based CD mastering and burning program
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/gnofin">gnofin</a>: GNOME financial manager
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/gnu-smalltalk">gnu-smalltalk</a>: An implementation of Smalltalk-80
<li>Linux 2.2.9
[<a href="../../oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/devel/kernel-headers-2.2.9.html">headers</a>,
<a href="../../oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/base/kernel-image-2.2.9.html">kernel image</a>,
and <a href="../../oldurl?../../../../Packages/unstable/devel/kernel-source-2.2.9.html">source</a>]
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/editors/levee">levee</a>: A very small vi clone
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/madoka">madoka</a>: IRC personal proxy, stationing, logger and bot program
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/rxp">rxp</a>: A validating XML parser
</ul>

<p>
<b>KDE and GNOME</b>:
People still using stable can get
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-9905/msg03598.html">updated GNOME debs</a>
for all GNOME packages in unstable. Debian sparc users can now get
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc-9905/msg00201.html">
unofficial KDE 1.1.1 packages</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Server News</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>samosa.debian.org is now running an i386 build daemon, which will autobuild
i386 .deb's when packages are first built for other architectures. It's already
made quite a few uploads, which underscores the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9905/msg02302.html">fact</a>
that "<i>'Ports' are no longer ports anymore, but primary development platforms
for many people.</i>"
<li>samosa also has an <a href="mail#mail2">upload queue</a> running on it, which
could be useful if you're in the US and closer to samosa than master.
</ul>
