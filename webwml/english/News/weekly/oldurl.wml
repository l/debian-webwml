#use wml::debian::projectnews::header PAGENAME="Old URL"

<p>
The URL this link used to point to is no longer available. Due to the
transitory nature of links in Debian Weekly News, this happens sometimes,
sorry.
</p>

<p>
If you desperately need to find the information this link once pointed to,
the original link is included in the url to this page, after the question
mark.
</p>

<p>
One common source of dead links is that Debian's 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</a> are themselves
compressed and archived after they are a few years old. If you're looking
for a post to a mailing list, you'll have to download the .gz file and
search for it.
