<p>Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.<br />
Some of the topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debian Live Lenny Beta1 released</li>
  <li>Debian Translations for French and German Reach 100%</li>
  <li>Policy for web apps session storage?</li>
  <li>... and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Debian Live Lenny Beta1</strong></p>
<p>The Debian Live team <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00013.html">announced</a> the first beta of
Debian Lenny's Live images. This is the first official release of Debian
Live CDs.  The main features are, that these Live images are build 100%
with packages in Debians main section and different flavours (GNOME, KDE
and Xfce as well as a small image without graphical environment.</p>

<p>Future releases should also contain an installation system, which is
not part of this beta1 version, since it still contains some minor bugs.
The images are created using <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-helper">live-helper</a>, a
collection of scripts helping to create these CD images.  There is also a
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-magic">graphical front end for
these script</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Debian Translations for French and German Reach 100%</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00014.html">Christian
Perrier announced</a> <q>On August 22nd, both German and French languages
reached 100% completeness for po-debconf translations in unstable.  For German,
this is the very first time this has happened and the German l10n
(localization) team deserves congratulations for that achievement.</q>
Po-debconf translations enables native speakers use Debian in their own
language and is an important aspect in working toward Debian's goal of being a
universal operating system.</p>
<p>Helge Kreutzmann <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2008/08/msg00172.html">added</a>,
that <q>this was only possible due to the tireless efforts of Christian to
actually get the translations into Debian.</q> Christian Perrier spend a lot of
time to coordinate new translations and upload packages containing new
translations.</p>


<p><strong>Policy for web apps session storage?</strong></p>
<p>After several bugs regarding <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00271.html">possible
symlink attacks</a> were reported, Olivier Berger <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00340.html">wonders</a>
about a policy how web applications (or their framework) should handle
storage of their session files. He noted that PHP already tries to prevent
possible symlink attacks, by using /var/lib/php5 which is only readable
by the root-user and automatically cleaned with a cronjob to prevent
attacks by opening a lot of sessions. He especially wonders, if whether
there's a similar approach for applications using perl and
CGI::Session.</p>


<p><strong>Usage of Package diffs?</strong></p>

<p>Joerg Jasper <a href="http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/01/pdiffs-1.html">asked</a>, if
the package diffs, a system to update the package list by downloading the
differences between versions of that file, is used at all.  Since he
usually turns that feature of, which seems to him only slow apt down and
wastes a lot of bandwidth of our mirror network.</p>

<p>Several people already reported to use this feature and asked for it
to stay.  Others proposed to keep the feature, but to disable it by
default.</p>

<p><strong>people.debian.org to move to a new host and file transfer
between Debian hosts</strong></p>

<p>Peter Palfrader <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00012.html">reported</a>
that people.debian.org, a service offering web space for Debian
Developers, will be moved to new host in late September ans asks all
Developers using that service to check if all needed packages are
available on the new host.</p>

<p>This announcement lead to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00780.html">questions</a>
regarding the file transfer between different hosts of the Debian
infrastructure. Peter <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/08/msg00172.html">summarized</a>
possible options and asks for further feedback.</p>


<p><strong>Other news</strong></p>
