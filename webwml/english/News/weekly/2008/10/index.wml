<p>Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.<br />
Some of the topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Debian Live Lenny Beta1 released</li>
  <li>Debian Translations for French and German Reach 100%</li>
  <li>Policy for web apps session storage?</li>
  <li>... and much more.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Debian Live Lenny Beta1</strong></p>
<p>The Debian Live team <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00013.html">announced</a> the first beta of
Debian Lenny's Live images. This is the first official release of Debian
Live CDs.  The main features are, that these Live images are built entirely out
of packages in Debians main section and different flavors (GNOME, KDE
and Xfce) as well as a lightweight image with no graphical environment.</p>

<p>Future releases should also contain an installation system, which is
not part of this beta1 version, since it still contains some minor bugs.
The images are created using <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-helper">live-helper</a>, a
collection of scripts helping to create these CD images.  There is also a
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/live-magic">graphical front end for
these script</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Debian Translations for French and German Reach 100%</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00014.html">Christian
Perrier announced</a> <q>On August 22nd, both German and French languages
reached 100% completeness for po-debconf translations in unstable.  For German,
this is the very first time this has happened and the German l10n
(localization) team deserves congratulations for that achievement.</q>
Po-debconf translations enables native speakers use Debian in their own
language and is an important aspect in working toward Debian's goal of being a
universal operating system.</p>
<p>Helge Kreutzmann <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2008/08/msg00172.html">added</a>,
that <q>this was only possible due to the tireless efforts of Christian to
actually get the translations into Debian.</q> Christian Perrier spend a lot of
time to coordinate new translations and upload packages containing new
translations.</p>


<p><strong>Policy for web apps session storage?</strong></p>
<p>After several bugs regarding <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00271.html">possible
symlink attacks</a> were reported, Olivier Berger <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00340.html">wonders</a>
about a policy how web applications (or their framework) should handle
storage of their session files. He noted that PHP already tries to prevent
possible symlink attacks, by using /var/lib/php5 which is only readable
by the root-user and automatically cleaned with a cronjob to prevent
attacks by opening a lot of sessions. He especially wonders whether
there's a similar approach for applications using Perl and
CGI::Session.</p>


<p><strong>Usage of Package diffs?</strong></p>

<p>Joerg Jaspert <a href="http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/01/pdiffs-1.html">asked</a>, if
the package diffs, a system to update the package list by downloading the
differences between versions of that file, is used at all.  Since he
usually turns that feature off, which seems to him only to slow apt down and
waste a lot of our mirror network's bandwidth.</p>

<p>Several people already reported to use this feature and asked for it
to stay.  Others proposed to keep the feature, but to disable it by
default.</p>

<p><strong>people.debian.org to move to a new host and file transfer
between Debian hosts</strong></p>

<p>Peter Palfrader <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00012.html">reported</a>
that people.debian.org, a service offering web space for Debian
Developers, will be moved to new host in late September and asks all
Developers using that service to check if all needed packages are
available on the new host.</p>

<p>This announcement led to <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00780.html">questions</a>
regarding file transfer between different hosts of the Debian
infrastructure. Peter <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/08/msg00172.html">summarized</a>
possible options and asks for further feedback.</p>


<p><strong>Other news</strong></p>
<p>Joerg Jaspert <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/08/msg00167.html">announced</a>,
that James Troup stepped down from his post as Debian Account Manager.
We would like to thanks James for the hard work and dedication over many
years.</p>

<p>Ana Beatriz Guerrero Lopez <a href="http://ekaia.org/blog/2008/08/21/kde-41-backported-packages-for-lenny/">announced</a>
that since Lenny has been frozen, back ported KDE 4.1 packages are
available now at <a href="http://kde4.debian.net/">kde4.debian.net</a>.</p>

<p>Joey Schulze <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200808311226">reported</a> from
the <a href="http://wiki.ffis.de/m68k/Meeting2008">m68k porter
meeting</a> which took place at the University of Kiel, Germany. The
Meeting was streamed, so that people unable to attend in person could
participate via IRC.  The <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/M68k/Meetings/Kiel2008">results</a> include
bits about the port to the coldfire architecture as well as status updates
for Sid and Lenny.</p>
