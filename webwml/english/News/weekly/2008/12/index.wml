<p>Welcome to this year's 12th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.<br />
Some of the topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bits from the DPL</li>
  <li>What you can do for Lenny</li>
  <li>500,000th bug reported</li>
  <li>... and much more.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Bits from the DPL</p></strong>
<p>Steve McIntyre sent out another <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/09/msg00009.html"><q>Bits
from the DPL</q></a> mail.  One of the topics he covers is the recently
finished eighth Debian Conference in Argentina.  Even though many developers
and contributors could not travel there he considers it a successful
conference.  He especially thanks the video team, who <q>did an <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf8/Videoteam/Thanks">amazing job this
year</a> making most of the sessions available via stream as well as forwarding
questions via Internet Relay Chat.</q>  Steve is already looking forward to
next year's Debian Conference, which will take place in the Junta Extremadura
in Spain.</p>

<p>He also summarizes the results of this year's <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2008">Google Summer of Code</a> where
students can work on specific free software projects and get paid by Google.
Debian got thirteen project slots.  Eleven of these projects were completed
successfully (the rest needed to drop out due to unforeseen problems).</p>

<p>Steve closes with a short summary about the upcoming stable release
<q>Lenny</q>.  Preparations for a release candidate of the debian-installer are
on its way and the release notes are taking shape.  But there are still a lot
of release critical bugs left to be fixed.</p>


<p><strong>What you can do for <q>Lenny</q></p></strong>
<p>Since the Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q> hasn't been released yet,
Alexander Reichle-Schmehl <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/10/msg00000.html">explained
the problems briefly</a> and listed some open issues which need to resolved
before Lenny can be released.  He points out that even a <q>simple user</q>
(which he categorizes as <q>everyone</q>) can help.</p>

<p>While most release blockers and release goals have been dealt with &mdash;
including transitions to newer compilers, libraries and other tools &mdash; the
development has reached the final phase, where the last release critical bugs
need to be fixed, upgrade tests performed and the release notes are written
out.  He gave a brief overview on how to perform upgrade tests, which he later
<a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/releasing-lenny">updated</a> in his
blog and showed other ways to help, like writing and translating the release
notes.</p>

<p>He later <a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/releasing-lenny-2">categorized</a> the
remaining bugs, while Lucas Nussbaum created a detailed list of the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00072.html">remaining
bugs</a>.</p>

<p>In related news, Franklin Piat
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/10/msg00043.html">created</a>
created a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/TestDebian">list of things</a> users
could test in the long term.</p>


<p><strong>500,000th bug reported</p></strong>
<p>Christian Perrier
<a href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/09/24#bug-500000-now">noted</a>
that the 500,000th <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/500000">bug</a> has been
reported to Debian's bug tracking sytem.  Nobuhiro Iwamatsu requested a feature
for the common debian build system, a tool used to create Debian packages, and
even provided a patch.</p>

<p>Lucas Nussbaum
<a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=312">provided</a> some statistics.
From these 500,000 bugs, nearly 410,000 have already been solved.</p>

<p>Christian notes that the vitality of the Debian Bug Tracking system is a
proof of the vitality of development in Debian (the current bug report rate is
about 60,000 bugs per year for a total of 24,000 packages in the distribution,
so only 2.5 bugs per year and package).</p>

<p>Therefore, Debian developers are proud that they had 500,000 occasions to
interact with their users. Of course, they are also proud that 410,000 of these
bugs are currently closed and only 250 are release critical for the upcoming
Debian lenny release.</p>


<p><strong>Valid-Until field in Release files</p></strong>
<p>While the current archive structure prevents injection of malicious packages
(e.g. at a "bad" mirror) through a digital trust path, it still had a small
flaw.  A potential attacker could use outdated release information and force
people to use an outdated mirror, leaving out the latest security updates.  To
address this problem, J&ouml;rg Jaspert <a href="http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2008/09/23/valid-until-field-in-release-f.html">added
a <q>valid until</q></a> field to the release information. APT (or another
package manager) can then check if the data available on the mirror is up to
date.  Work has already begun to integrate such a feature in the apt package
manager and tools based upon it; however,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/499897">some questions</a> are still open.</p>


<p><strong>Choosing language during NAS installations</p></strong>
<p>Martin Michlmayr <a href="http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/nas-localechooser">reported</a> that
due to changes of the internal structure of the debian-installer, it is now
possible to choose the language of the installation (and the resulting system).
Installations on headless NAS devices are typically done remotely via SSH and
up until now the network was started after the language had been chosen, so
this feature was completely disabled for such devices.  Due to changes in the
component responsible for choosing the locale, this feature could now be
enabled for these kinds of devices as well.</p>


<p><strong>m68k moved to debian-ports</p></strong>
<p>After missing release criteria for Etch and Lenny, the m68k port made the
switch from using the wanna-build instance on Debian infrastructure to the one
on <a href="http://www.debian-ports.org/">Debian-Ports</a>. This is a necessary
step before m68k will be removed from the Debian archive.  <a
href="http://unstable.buildd.net/index-m68k.html">Buildd.Net</a> still supports
the m68k architecture and has already adopted the change.  The m68k port was
one of two official ports in the first Debian release, Debian 2.0 (the other
being i386).</p>


<p><strong>Other news</p></strong>

<p>Christian Perrier <a href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/09/21#di-freeze-lenny-final">released</a>
the final number of languages which will be supported in the debian-installer
of the upcoming release.  All in all 63 languages will be supported, which is 5
more than in the current release.</p>

<p>A long term goal, the move from documentation in /usr/doc to /usr/share/doc as recommended in
the Filesystem hierarchy standard, has been <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/322762#1225 completed">recently</a>.</p>

<p>Christian Perrier <a href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2008/09/30#apt-maintenance">noted</a>
that the team working on apt, the core package manager of Debian and Debian
based distributions, is lacking manpower and could use some help.</p>
