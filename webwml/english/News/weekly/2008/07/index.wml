<p>Welcome to this year's 7th issue of DPN, the newsletter for the Debian
community.<br />
Some of the topics covered in this issue:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Updates to the Lenny release process</li>
  <li>Debian-installer to support loading of external firmware</li>
  <li>Best practice for debug packages</li>
  <li>... and much more.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Updates to the Lenny release process</strong></p>
<p>Luk Claes sent a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/07/msg00005.html">release update</a>
regarding the upcoming stable release Debian 5.0 <q>Lenny</q>.  An important part is that starting with next
week, the transition of packages from the unstable to the testing branch will be frozen to concentrate on
fixing the remaining bugs.  He further reports on the various release goals; he considers them in good shape,
but is a bit worried about the architecture qualification pages on wiki.debian.org, which still lack
a lot of information.  Porters should provide status information on these pages, so it's easier
for the release team to keep themselves informed about the status of different hardware architectures.</p>

<p>In related news Ana Guerrero <a href="http://ekaia.org/blog/2008/07/19/debian-packages-for-kde-41-koffice-alpha9-and-more/">reported</a>
about the status of KDE (and especially KDE4) related packages in the upcoming release of Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-installer to support loading of external firmware</strong></p>
<p>Joey Hess <a href="http://kitenet.net/~joey/blog/entry/d-i_firmware_loading/">announced</a> a new feature of
the Debian installer: On demand loading of firmware.  Since some drivers need to load such
binary blobs to the device before they can operate but the firmware is often non-free according
to the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>, some
devices could only be operated after Debian has been successfully installed and network access
has been configured by adding Debian's non-free section to the package sources.  Which would fail,
if the network driver itself needed to load firmware to operate.</p>

<p>With the newly introduced feature, it is now possible to drop the firmware files on separate media,
such as a USB stick.  The Debian-Installer will then automatically load the necessary files.  He also noted
that the Debian-CD team <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/firmware/">builds zip files and tarballs</a>
containing all the firmware that Debian ships in non-free.</p>

<p><strong>Best practice for debug packages</strong></p>
<p>Theodore Tso <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00187.html">wondered</a> about best practice
for debug packages, which contain additional data to ease debugging of programs and libraries.
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00188.html">Mike Hommey answered</a> that debug files should be
installed at the path of the non-debug files, preceded by /usr/lib/debug/ and (depending on the size of the debug data)
split off in a separate package. Joerg Jaspert <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00205.html">added</a>
that the priority of such debug packages should be <tt>extra</tt> and that they should be in the same section as the parent
package.</p>

<p><strong>DebConf 8 website call for help</strong></p>
<p>Martin Ferrari <a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf8/mf_website_help.dc">called for help</a> for the website
of the upcoming Debian Conference.  A lot of information needed by travelers is missing.  He sees identifying missing data
as the most important task, since it's difficult to guess what foreigners might need to know when you're a local.</p>

<p><strong>Debian release versioning</strong></p>
<p>Martin Krafft <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00371.html">proposed</a> changing
the way Debian versions its releases.  He proposed increasing the first number with each release
and the second one with every <q>point release</q>/<q>r-release</q> of the stable branch only including fixed packages, while
new releases of the stable release adding new features (like the upcoming <q>Etch and a half</q>) should
get a five as second number to show the <q>half</q> update. Lars Wirzenius
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00395.html">reminded</a> people that Debian introduced the current
versioning scheme because CD vendors feared old boxes would stay on the shelves after a point release.  Others
preferred a <q>classic two dot</q> versioning scheme, where the first number gets increased with every new major release,
the third one with <q>bug fix</q> releases and the second one with releases adding new features.</p>

<p><strong>Package management unsafe? - No.</strong></p>
<p>A recently published <a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/people/justin/packagemanagersecurity/attacks-on-package-managers.html">study</a>
which described several attack vectors against Linux systems using their package management has recently caused
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2008/07/msg00054.html">some</a>
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/07/msg00321.html">discussion</a>.  While the study was generally judged to be
<q>oversensationalized attention-grabbing</q> the consensus was that one weak point does remain: a potential attacker
could manipulate the domain name system and redirect security.debian.org, source of security updates for Debian,
to an outdated copy of that server.  Plans are being drafted to add a signed time stamp to prevent this kind of
attack.</p>



<p><strong>Other news</strong></p>

Software Meeting by Debian Developer Lucas Nussbaum
on the topics
<a href="http://2008.rmll.info/Making-a-first-contribution-to.html">Why and how to make a first contribution to Debian</a>

<p>Starting with the next release, <a href="https://packages.debian.org/rsyslog">rsyslog</a> will be the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2008/07/msg00259.html">preferred</a> system logging daemon,
replacing <a href="https://packages.debian.org/sysklogd">syslogd</a> and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/klogd">klogd</a>.</p>

<p>Thijs Kinkhorst <a href="http://loeki.tv/log/archives/86-msttcorefonts-renamed-and-losing-relevance.html">noted</a> that he has renamed
the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/msttcorefonts">msttcorefonts</a> package to
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/ttf-mscorefonts-installer">ttf-mscorefonts-installer</a>.
He also noted that they continue to
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~igloo/popcon-graphs/index.php?packages=ttf-liberation">lose relevance</a>,
since it's often possible to replace them them with the fonts supplied by the
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/ttf-liberation">ttf-liberation</a> package.</p>
