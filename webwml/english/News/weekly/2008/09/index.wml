<p><strong>Debian turns 15</strong></p>

<p>On 16 August 1993 Ian Murdock
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6">announced</a>
a new Linux distribution named <q>Debian</q>. 15 years later the project
started by him is the biggest Linux distribution worldwide, offering more than
20 000 software packages maintained by over 1'000 volunteers, supporting more
hardware architectures than any other Linux distribution, and providing a base
for more than twenty active derivatives, like
<a href="http://www.knoppix.net">Knoppix</a>,
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.org">Skolelinux</a> or 
<a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/08/msg00132.html">Users</a>,
<a href="http://blog.internetnews.com/skerner/2008/08/debian-15-is-it-still-relevant.html">journalists</a>,
and <a href="http://www.michaelandkrissy.com/node/87">Debian Developers</a>
congratulated, sometimes
<a href="http://www.itwire.com/content/view/20064/53/">just happy</a>, sometimes
<a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/features/article.php/3765826/Debian+GNU/Linux:+15+Years+Old+and+at+the+Crossroads.htm">thoughtfully</a>,
and celebrated the birthday of the Debian project <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay2008">worldwide</a> with parties and
single day conferences (sometimes even with live streams of the sessions). Even
a <a href="http://www.freeandopenisland.org/wiki/index.php?title=Debian_Day_2008">virtual
birthday party</a> was held in Second live (a virtual world powered by
<a href="http://www.debian.org/users/com/lindenlab">Debian</a>) where musicians
Blue4u Nowicka and Jaggpro McCann gave concerts as an opener to the virtual
party. In Argentina Steve McIntyre, current Debian Project Leader, opened the
8th Debian Conference with a talk describing the current state of the Debian
project and the long way it has come until today. His talk is already available
as a downloadable
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2008/debconf8/high/490_Debian.ogg">video</a>.</p>

<p>The Debian project would like to thank its users and developers for the
confidence placed in our distribution over the last 15 years and is looking
forward to the upcoming release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0 <q>Lenny</q> and many
happy returns.</p>


<p><strong>Freespire 5 to be based on Debian</strong></p>
<p>Recently acquired by the Xandros Corporation, the upcoming release of
Freespire will be based on the Debian GNU/Linux <q>Lenny</q> release.  The
current release of Freespire (2.0.8) is still based on Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy
Gibbon). <q>A combined Xandros/Linspire development effort will return
Freespire to its Debian GNU/Linux roots and put it in sync with Xandros Desktop
Pro,</q>
<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/freespire-returns-debian-roots/story.aspx?guid={21713CB4-464B-4292-89EB-BE41F67FDD92}&dist=hppr">said
Andreas Typaldos</a>, Xandros CEO. Freespire 5 is slated to be released in the
fourth quarter of 2008.</p>


<p><strong>8th annual Debian Conference finished</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://debconf8.debconf.org/">8th annual Debian Conference</a>,
allowing Users and Developers to come together, learn new techniques and
discuss further development has finished yesterday on the 17th August 2008.
Some results of the discussions which took place there are mentioned in this
issue.  Videos of the conference sessions are available (or will be soon) at
the
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2008/debconf8/">meetings archive</a>.
The video team asks for <a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf8/Videoteam/Thanks">feedback</a>. It is
also possible to give <a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf8/jj_feedback.dc">feedback to speakers
and topics</a>. Since most attendees are still on their way home, the next
issue of the Debian Project News will have a deeper coverage of the Debian
Conference and the associated
<a href="http://debconf8.debconf.org/debianday.xhtml">Debian Day</a> at Buenos
Aires.</p>


<p><strong>Debian on the OpenMoko FreeRunner</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://lists.linuxtogo.org/pipermail/smartphones-standards/2008-August/000232.html">Joachim
Breitner announces</a> the start of an official Debian port to the
OpenMoko FreeRunner, a smartphone that was designed and developed in a free and
open manner. This enables Debian users to use the distribution of their choice
even on their telephone. <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianOnFreeRunner">Installation
instructions</a> can be found on the Debian wiki.</p>


<p><strong>Bits from the X Strike Force</strong></p>
<p>Julien Cristau
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00010.html">reports</a>
 on the newest developments within the X Strike Force. The X Strike
Force is happy to announce that the configuration of the Xorg server has been
considerably simplified and it is now also possible to configure video output
at runtime. Furthermore new drivers have been packaged, namely the
<a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org/wiki/">nouveau driver</a>, a
reverse-engineering effort for nVidia cards and
<a href="http://www.openchrome.org/">openchrome</a>, which will support via
chipsets instead of the unmaintained via driver. The nouveau driver does not
yet have release-quality but the X Strike Force asks for testing of the
experimental build. xorg-server 1.5 and mesa 7.1 are also currently in
experimental and are scheduled to advance to sid after the Lenny release. At
around the same time, the team plans to enable hotplugging of input devices,
and their configuration through hal. The X Strike Force concludes their report
with a call for maintainers (DDs and non-DDs). People interested in joining the
team can contact them on #debian-x on irc.debian.org, or on
debian-x@lists.debian.org.</p>


<p><strong>Request for adoption: The Debian Jr. project</strong></p>
<p>Ben Armstrong
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00004.html">is
looking for someone</a>  to take over the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianJr">Debian Jr.</a> project, since he is
currently too involved with other Debian-internal projects and can no longer
spend the necessary time on it. He recommends several measures to move the
project forward and hopes to find a new leader for the project who will tackle
these and other tasks and carry on his work on a child-friendly custom Debian
distribution.</p>


<p><strong>Upcoming changes to supported architectures</strong></p>
<p>One of the problems discussed during this year's Debian Conference was
ftp-master.debian.org, the main host for the Debian archive, running into
resource constraints.  <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00009.html">Joerg
Jaspert announced</a> the results:  Hardware architectures, which have failed
to be included in 2 successive official releases, will be moved to an other
host (e.g. <a href="http://debian-ports.org">debian-ports.org</a>). The main
purpose is to free space for architectures that are in a better shape and
therefore have higher chances of being in an release.</p>

<p>The current
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00369.html">candidates for
removal</a> are m68k, hurd-i386 and arm (which will be replaced by armel
anyway), while kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64 as well as
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00371.html">other
architectures</a> could now be added to the official Debian archive machines.
Of course removed architectures can be re-added to the main archive, when they
have proven to be fit for release.</p>


<p><strong>Dropping packages in main building packages in contrib</strong></p>
<p>Joerg Jaspert
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00148.html">wondered</a>
if it is a necessary feature, that source packages of a specific component
(main, contrib or non-free) may create binary packages within an other
component.  Some source packages in Debian main use that feature to create
binary packages in contrib.  Dropping this feature would ease a re-design of
the central project database.  When asked for the benefits of dropping this
feature, Stefano Zacchiroli
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2008/08/msg00173.html">explained</a>
further that the database should reflect the structure of the project,
especially since only the component main is an official part of Debian.
Blurring the difference might confuse our users and is <q>weird at best</q>.</p>


<p><strong>Bits from the GNU/kFreeBSD porters</strong></p>
<p>Aurelien Jarno gave a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00007.html">status
report</a> about the kFreeBSD port.  Overall it is in very good shape.
Currently i386 and AMD64 based architectures are supported. It has a complete
toolchain (including java) and more than 85% of all packages are built.  He
asked for help to qualify as a releasable architecture, since a port of the
debian-installer is currently missing.</p>


<p><strong>FAI developer workshop at the Linuxhotel in Essen/Germany</strong></p>
<p>At the weekend from 8th until 10th of August, the FAI (Fully Automatic
Installation - an installation and update-management framework for Debian and
other distributions) developer team met at the Linuxhotel in Essen, Germany, to
make FAI fit for the Lenny release. In a productive as well as fun meeting,
seven people got a lot of things done, but most importantly, they did a lot of
testing of the current FAI functionality in the Lenny context.</p>

<p>Important bugs were found and solved and future development has been discussed,
e.g. integrating tests for classes as well as software regressions, how to deal
with copyright issues and how contributors should be mentioned in the Debian
copyright files. Further issues that were tackled during the meeting were how
more developers could be attracted to add their code into FAI, how to make it
available for testing by users, and how to get external patches into mainline
FAI - which is currently only written to by the main developer. An first
documentation of the meeting's outcome can be found in the
<a href="http://faiwiki.informatik.uni-koeln.de/index.php/DeveloperWorkshopAugust2008#Documentation">faiwiki</a>.
The meeting was sponsored by the <a href="http://www.linuxhotel.de">Linuxhotel</a> Essen,
the <a href="http://www.linux-ag.de">Linux Information
Systems AG</a> and <a href="http://lt-ec.de/">LT-ec</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Debian Lenny to Support Low-Power NAS Systems</strong></p>
<p>Martin Michlmayr <a href="http://www.cyrius.com/journal/debian/2.6.26-udebs">
updated kernels for MIPS and ARM for kernel version 2.6.26</a>. These kernel
updates bring major improvements to the ARM architecture support, which helps
running Debian on low-power NAS devices like the
<a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/">QNAP TS-409</a>. With 2.6.26 coming
closer to lenny, lenny is coming closer to run on these devices.</p>


<p><strong>Future of snapshot.debian.net</strong></p>
<p>Since <a href="http://snapshot.debian.net">snapshot.debian.net</a> - a
service storing all versions of all Debian packages ever uploaded to the
archive including useful symlinks e.g. for browsing to specific days - has
problems from time to time keeping up its disc space, Eddy Petrisor
<a href="http://ramblingfoo.blogspot.com/2008/08/crazy-idea-user-supported.html">wondered</a>,
if a distributed, user supported structure for storing this huge
amount of data would be a good idea.  Andrew Pollock
<a href="http://blog.andrew.net.au/2008/08/16#fund_snapshot.debian.net">answered</a>
that Debian could spend some of its fund for this service.  Cyril
Brulebois <a href="http://ikibiki.org//blog/2008/08/16/snapshot.debian.org/">added</a>
that it has been <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2008/08/msg00060.html">announced</a>
that snapshot.debian.net should be made an official service provided by Debian,
making it easier to spend funds on it.</p>


<p><strong>Artwork and Desktop themes for Debian <q>Lenny</q></strong></p>
<p>Valessio Brito
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2008/08/msg00000.html">announced</a>
that the work for artwork and themes for the upcoming stable
release of Debian GNU/Linux 5.0" Lenny has been started during
<a href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20080804.231055.943faaa6.en.html">DebCamp</a>
the hacking session before the annual Debian Conference. In the meantime and
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop/2008/08/msg00068.html">updated
version</a> of the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/desktop-base">desktop-base</a>
package has been uploaded including a new default theme as
well as a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianArtThemesNightly">second
one</a>.</p>


<p><strong>CD/DVD Image Downloads - A Reminder / rsync on ftp.debian.org</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/2008/08/msg00000.html">Josip
Rodin noted</a> that there seems to be a rush of CD/DVD image hoarding
happening.  Particularly, it seems that many people are not only downloading
the first image, but the additional images (CDs 2-20+) as well.  The full set
of images is published so that they can be downloaded by those who do not have
regular access to a reliable internet connection.  However, for those who do
have solid Internet connections, it is more efficient to retrieve packages
directly from the repositories.</p>

<p>In related news Josip Rodin
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors/2008/08/msg00018.html">noted</a>
that the rsync service on ftp.debian.org has been deprecated since 2001 and has
now been disabled completely.  Everyone who has used that mirror to synchronise
his own mirror using rsync should switch to an other mirror.  A complete list
of Debian mirrors is available at
<a href="http://www.debian.org/mirror/list">http://www.debian.org/mirror/list</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Bits from the DPN editors</strong></p>
<p>The editors of the Debian Project News sent a first
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/08/msg00008.html">status
report</a> on the start-up period of the DPN.  After a rough start a workflow has
now been established which overall works but still has some issues, including
the often missing time for native speakers to proofread the drafts and for
translators to prepare versions of the project news in their own language, to
be sent out simultaneously with the original news.  But most importantly more
people are needed to contribute to the Debian Project News by writing small
texts on the noteworthy news collected at each issue's
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/Issues/Current">development page</a>.</p>





<p><strong>Other news</strong></p>

<p>Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=305">wondered</a> if the technical
solution of freezing the propagation of packages from the unstable development
branch to the to-be-released-soon testing branch is adequate.  Since the
requirement of non-disruptive changes are more a social problem, it shouldn't
be solved by strict technical measures and manual approval of exceptions.</p>

<p>Joey Schulze <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2008/08/msg00002.html">announced</a>
the 2008 M68k Linux Porter Meeting, which will take place from August 29th to
31st at the University of Kiel, Germany.</p>

<p>Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2008/08/msg00071.html">asked for
final reviews</a> for the Debian Enhancement Proposal 1, which tries to improve
the way how to deal with &quot;non maintainer uploads&quot; (NMUs).</p>

<p>Sandro Tosi <a href="http://sandrotosi.blogspot.com/2008/08/another-info-source-for-debian.html">noticed</a>
that the #debian-devel@OFTC channel topic is often used to give status messages
in the case of severe or exceptional situations (outages, downtimes, etc). In
order to stay informed even if not connected to oftc he recommends subscribing
to the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/TopicDebianDevel">Debian Wiki page that
mirrors that channel's topic</a>.</p>

<p>Neil Williams <a href="http://www.linux.codehelp.co.uk/serendipity/index.php?/archives/129-po4a-translation-support-from-any-format.html">summarized</a>
the usage of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/po4a">PO for anything</a> for
maintaining translations of various documents, including manpages.</p>

<p>Nicolas Francois <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2008/08/msg00041.html">announced</a>
that the services hosted on i18n.debian.net (for example the web frontend to
the Debian Package Description Translation Project) is now available via SSL,
too.</p>

<p>Stefano Zacchiroli reported <a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2008/08/improved_integration_among_PTS_and_Lintian/">several</a>
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2008/08/PTS_integrated_with_mentors_and_gifts/">improvements</a>
he did for the <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org">package tracking
system</a>. He fixed several bugs and feature request including tighter
integration with <a href="http://packages.debian.org/lintian">lintian</a>, a
tool for checking Debian packages for common errors, and <a
href="http://mentors.debian.net">mentors.debian.net</a>, a service used by
package maintainers searching for Debian Developers to &quot;sponsor&quot;
their upload to the Debian archive.</p>

<p>Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=303">blogged</a> about an important
usecase for the Ultimate Debian Database, a Google Summer of Code project
integrating several information sources within Debian: recently removals of
important packages from the testing Distribution have caused some discussion.
Tracking these important packages will be easier through this database.</p>
