#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="2003-08-12" SUMMARY="Crontab, Libraries, MTA, Python, Bugs, Debconf, Advantages, Hurd, Ant, Birthday, LPI"
# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 32nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Following the <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2003/26/">\
26th</a> issue, Stephan Wehrheim wrote a document about installing Debian 3.0
on a Dell <a
href="http://www.StephanWehrheim.de/computer/dell8200+debian30/dell8200+debian30.html">\
Inspiron 8200</a>.  Michael Singer <a
href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/2246751">looked</a>
at Open Source as a social movement, in a similar way to what Bruce Perens
discussed at Linuxworld San Francisco.</p>

<p><strong>Crontab no longer setuid.</strong> Steve Greenland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00160.html">reported</a>
that he has changed <code>crontab</code> to be setgid 'cron' rather than
setuid 'root'.  This introduces a new group 'cron' which
will automatically be created during installation.</p>

<p><strong>Removal of Libraries from the Archive.</strong> Chris Cheney <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00187.html">noticed</a>
that a library was removed which he had just listed as a dependency for an
uploaded package.  He proposed to make an addition to policy stating that an
old library cannot be removed from the archive until no other package depends
on it.  Richard Braakman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00246.html">explained</a>
that the past had shown that as long as the old library was still around,
there was apparently no incentive for anyone to remove the dependency.</p>

<p><strong>No Mutt Dependency on an MTA?</strong> Artur Czechowski <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00349.html">wondered</a> if
Mutt should only <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/202869">recommend</a> a
mail-transfer-agent (MTA) instead of depending on it.  Rene Engelhard <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00379.html">explained</a>
that sending mail is one of the key features of Mutt, but this requires an
MTA, hence the dependency should remain.</p>

<p><strong>Python 2.3 Transition.</strong> Matthias Klose <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00361.html">announced</a>
the next Python transition after version 2.3 has been <a
href="http://python.org/2.3/highlights.html">released</a>.  With the next
upload of <code>python2.3</code>, it will become the default version of
Python.  Some packages become uninstallable until they are converted to the
new version, though.</p>

<p><strong>Explanations for Reassigning Bugs.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00697.html">requested</a>
that people include an explanation for the new package maintainer when they
reassign a bug to a different package.  He said that it is very annoying to
get several bug reports that were reassigned to ones own packages, with no
explanation attached, forcing the maintainer to grab the information on his
own.</p>

<p><strong>Zeroconf for Debian?</strong> Andrew Pollock <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00727.html">wondered</a> if
somebody is working on getting <a href="http://www.zeroconf.org/">Zeroconf</a>
implemented within the Debian system.  <a
href="http://zeroconf.sourceforge.net/">Zero configuration</a> IP networking
means that two computers hooked together build an ad-hoc IP network and can
talk to each other without human intervention.  The package <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/zcip">zcip</a> is supposed to implement
this.</p>

<p><strong>Debconf I18n improved.</strong> Collaboration between Joey Hess and Tomohiro
Kubota has lead to a major improvement in <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/debconf">debconf</a>'s internationalisation
(i18n) in version <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0307/msg00714.html">\
1.3.0</a>.  This version solves line-folding <a
href="http://www.debian.or.jp/~kubota/mojibake/debconf">problems</a> for
several languages and encodings.  Debconf template translators for Chinese and
Japanese will no more need to insert redundant whitespaces which were
previously needed to avoid the problem.</p>

<p><strong>Advantages of using Debian.</strong> Markus Raab <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-german-0308/msg00753.html">\
listed</a> (only in German) many advantages of using Debian.  He highlighted
the package management system and the strong implementation of the <a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>.  He
also emphasised the number of available packages, the guaranteed freeness,
leaving alternatives and choice for the user, the documentation and more.
Much of this is also included in the <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/doc/advantages.html">Advantages
HOWTO</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hurd Kernel Change.</strong> Ciaran O'Riordan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0308/msg00036.html">reported</a>
that the Hurd will move from Gnumach to <a
href="http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/L4/">L4</a> in the long term.  <a
href="http://www.l4ka.org/projects/hazelnut/">Hazelnut</a> is the name of the
L4 implementation that Hurd is being ported to.  In the short term, though,
there's a moderate change from gnumach1.3 to gnumach2.0 which is called
oskit-mach.</p>

<p><strong>Support for Ant.</strong> Arnaud Vandyck <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0307/msg00138.html">reported</a>
that a lot of java packages are built with ant.  It would probably be a good
idea to have common practices with ant including a default interface into
package building.  Stefan Gybas would <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0307/msg00139.html">like</a> to
create an Ant class for the <a
href="http://build-common.alioth.debian.org/">Common Debian Build System</a>
(CDBS) so that <code>debian/rules</code> will become really simple.</p>

<p><strong>Policy for 32-bit UIDs and GIDs?</strong> Steve Langasek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0307/msg00003.html">reported</a>
that <a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s9.2">section 9.2</a>
of policy currently describes uid and gid classes covering the range of
0-65535.  This appears to no longer be comprehensive since on a current system
running a 2.4.18 kernel and libc6 2.3.1-17 one can assign 32-bit user ids to
accounts and reference these accounts in file ownerships, su to them, etc.  He
wondered if the Debian Policy should be expanded to address this greatly
increased range of available ids.</p>

<p><strong>Debian turns 10.</strong> On August 16th, the Debian Project will
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2003/20030811">celebrate</a> its 10th birthday with
several <a href="http://www.debconf.org/10years/">parties</a> around the
globe.  The largest parties will take place in <a
href="http://www.penguin.cz/~skim/10deb">Brno</a>, Czech Republic, <a
href="http://www.linux-aktivaattori.org/twiki/bin/view/Bazaar/DebianBirthdayTurku2003">\
Turku</a>, Finland, <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/party/">\
Wallenrod</a> and <a href="http://buug.de/deb10/">Berlin</a>, Germany, as well
as in <a href="http://the.earth.li/~huggie/cgi-bin/moin/Debian10thBirthday">\
Cambridge</a> in the United Kingdom.  During the last ten years, the project
has developed an extensive set of policies and procedures for packaging and
delivering software.  These standards are backed up by tools, automation, and
documentation implementing all of Debian's key elements in an open and visible
way.  As a present, Jörg Jaspert created a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~joerg/rettcd/">rescue CD</a> in the size of a
<a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/01_linuxdistri_bs/debian/debiangeburtstag/framify">\
business card</a> which will be handed out in Berlin and Wallenrod.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Package Exams at LPI.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.lpi.org/">Linux Professional Institute</a> (LPI) introduced
new exams which allow candidates to be tested on RPM or Debian package
management.  Candidates pick the package they wish to be tested on when
beginning an exam, LPI said on a story on <a
href="http://www.certcities.com/editorial/news/story.asp?EditorialsID=426">
Certcities.com</a>.  LPI has delivered more than 24,000 exams, and awarded
more than 5,500 certifications worldwide.</p>

<p><strong>List of setuid/setgid Binaries in the current stable Release.</strong> Steve Kemp
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg02375.html">\
announced</a> a list of all the setuid/setgid binaries in the current release.

on games and Joey Hess'
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg02404.html">\

several</a>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg00039.html">\
