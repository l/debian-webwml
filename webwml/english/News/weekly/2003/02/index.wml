# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's second issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  It looks as if the GCC transition reported
in last week's issue is working well.  A new verb was accidentally <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00098.html">created</a>
during a discussion about KDE&nbsp;3 and Debian.  It was said that KDE&nbsp;3
will sid soon.  A contribution to an elitist Debian dialect.</p>

<p> <strong>SPI Progress.</strong> Nils Lohner <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000034.html">\
resigned</a> as president of <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the
Public Interest</a> (SPI) and Ean Schuessler was <a
href="https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/resolution-2002-12-17.wta.2">\
appointed</a> as new vice president.  SPI provides legal and financial support
for several Free Software projects, including Debian.  On the most recent
Board meeting, a <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000035.html">\
charter</a> for a by-laws committee was resolved.  John Goerzen will be chairing
the committee to revise SPI by-laws.  Three <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000037.html">\
volunteers</a> are still needed to fill open seats.  Additionally <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000036.html">\
nominations</a> to fill three open seats on the SPI board are also being
accepted and members will vote on them.  As always, SPI is
inviting interested people to become <a
href="https://www.spi-inc.org/membership">new members</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Interview: Living up to the Linux name.</strong> Sam Varghese from <a
href="http://www.theage.com.au">The Age</a> featured an <a
href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/08/1041989994382.html">\
interview</a> with a member of the Debian Press Team this week.  Sam wanted to
know the key differences between Debian and other distributions, what the
motivation for Debian developers was since there didn't seem to be any
payback, whether the release cycle was a strength or weakness and predictions
for the future of the Debian project.</p>

<p><strong>Screen Snapshots of the Installation Process.</strong> The Debian
Press Team recently received a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0301/msg00059.html">request</a> from
<a href="http://www.pcw.co.uk/">Personal Computer World</a>, a UK-based PC
magazine, for snapshots of the woody installation process.  Thorsten Sauter
was <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0301/msg00068.html">kind
enough</a> to produce a set of <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~joey/misc/woody-install.tar.bz2">PNG images</a>,
that shows all important steps of installing a woody system.</p>

<p><strong>3.0r1 Update CDs Available.</strong> Significant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0301/msg00043.html">hardware
problems</a> over the holiday period caused some delay, but Steve McIntyre 
finally <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0301/msg00048.html">\
generated</a> update CD images for Debian 3.0 to 3.0r1.  Using <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> and the <a
href="http://non-us.cdimage.debian.org/jigdo-area/3.0_r1/jigdo/">template
files</a> update CDs are now available.</p>

<p><strong>Potential x86-64 Port of Debian.</strong> Bart Trojanowski <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00453.html">expressed</a>
interest in getting work started on porting Debian to <a
href="http://www.amd.com/">AMD's</a> upcoming <a
href="http://www.x86-64.org/">x86-64 architecture</a>.  The x86-64
architecture will be AMD's new 64 bit processor, which is
expected to <a
href="http://www.amd.com/us-en/Corporate/VirtualPressRoom/0,,51_104_543~62652,00.html">\
enable</a> simultaneous 32-bit and 64-bit computing.  Michael Banck
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00683.html">\
discussed</a> the possibility of gaining access to x86-64 hardware with AMD's
Open Source representative, but that <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00683.html">includes</a> an
evil NDA and thus is not possible for Debian at the moment.</p>

<p><strong>Itsy Package Management System.</strong> Josh Narins was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00015.html">curious</a>
about the oldest hardware still running Debian.  After some people described
old <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00017.html">486</a> and
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00021.html">386</a>
machines still alive with Debian, discussion turned to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00080.html">slow
performance</a> of dpkg under these resource-limited environments.  Josh then
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0301/msg00095.html">found</a>
the <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/z/wiki/iPKG">Itsy Package Management
System</a> (iPKG).  iPKG was designed to be as much like Debian's package
management system as possible and supports the <code>.deb</code>
package format.
However, iPKG is very lightweight and tailored for GNU/Linux installations
with severe storage limitations such as handheld computers.</p>

<p><strong>Free Software Licenses Revocable?</strong>  Recent <a
href="http://www.advogato.com/article/606.html">postings</a> on <a
href="http://www.advogato.com/">Advogato</a> discuss the legality of
developers retrospectively revoking licenses such as the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a> (GPL).
 Also under debate was the role (if any) of <a
href="http://www.duhaime.org/contract/ca-con1.htm">contract law</a> in the
enforcement or regulation of <a
href="http://www.denniskennedy.com/opensourcelaw.htm">copyright
licenses</a> and whether or not Free Software licenses are granted in
perpetuity.  There is currently some ambiguity in this area, although it
seems that outcomes will vary depending upon which jurisdiction a developer
is located in.  A call was made to update the GPL to more clearly address
these issues.</p>

<p><strong>Problem with Web Page Encoding.</strong> Tomohiro Kubota (&#20037;&#20445;&#30000;&#26234;&#24195;) <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0301/msg00018.html">discovered</a> a
severe problem with non-ASCII characters on automatically generated
multilingual <a href="$(HOME)/devel/people">web pages</a> when multibyte
encoding (such as ISO-2022-JP for Japanese or EUC-KR for Korean) is used.  He
notes that ISO-8859-1 is a local character encoding like KOI8-R
and EUC-JP (they conflict with one another), and hence, should not be used when a
different encoding is specified on web pages.  Instead, non-ASCII characters
should be encoded as HTML entities.</p>

<p><strong>Kernel without Ext2 Support?</strong> Marcel Kolaja <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00217.html">noticed</a>
that the kernel configuration for i386 and i686 optimized kernels differ in
regard to the second extended filesystem (Ext2).  The latter has it compiled
only as a module.  <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00225.html">Josselin
Mouette</a> and <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00224.html">Daniel
Jacobowitz</a> explained that this is a feature rather then a bug.  The kernel
loads a ramdisk with the modules in it.  In Linux 2.6 initrd will be replaced
by initramfs.</p>

<p><strong>Altering Debian Release Numbers.</strong> Scott James Remnant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00337.html">proposed</a> to
alter the release numbering scheme since he believes that the next Debian
release will be a new major version as well, and should therefore be named
Debian 4 (sarge) instead of Debian 4.0 (sarge).  Martin Michlmayr <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00792.html">added</a> that
one of the most important things to keep in mind when proposing to change
something which is exposed to every user is that one should be
conservative.</p>

<p><strong>New Virtual Package Name dns-server?</strong> Toni Mueller <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00607.html">suggested</a>
to create one or two new virtual package names for nameservers.  He noticed
that Debian ships several and they only partially conflict with each other.
Michael Poole <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00608.html">wondered</a>
why packages need to conflict since they can be installed concurrently and
only need to be configured differently.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Woody on a Vaio Laptop.</strong> Roger Lipscombe took some <a
href="http://www.differentpla.net/~roger/hardware/vaio-linux.html">notes</a>,
documenting how he installed Debian 3.0 (Woody) on his Vaio SRX87 laptop.
Because the laptop comes with a firewire based DVD-ROM drive which is
currently not supported by the installation process, he had to do a network
installation, using PXE to boot from the network.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a .deb of .deb Files.</strong> Steve Traugott <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00633.html">wanted</a> to
know if there is a tool that bundles a Debian package, its prerequisite
packages, and its related debconf db deltas, into a single archive.  He tries
to implement techniques described in this administration <a
href="http://www.infrastructures.org/papers/turing/turing.html">paper</a>.
The existing tool <code>apt-zip</code> is not <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00667.html">sufficient</a>.

<p><strong>The Story of radiusd-freeradius.</strong> Chad Miller <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00882.html">explained</a>
the current status of radiusd-freeradius.  A dummy bug was filed against this
package to keep it outside of woody, but unfortunately the bug report wasn't
removed after the release and when the maintainer didn't pay enough attention
the package was removed from testing and unstable during an announced mass
removal.  The package can't be added back since it indirectly links against
libssl but is licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a>.  However, some people
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00891.html">maintain</a>
private packages for radiusd-freeradius.</p>

<p><strong>CUPS and SSL.</strong> Jeff Licquia <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0301/msg00008.html">contacted</a> the
developers of GNU TLS to discuss whether the OpenSSL compatibility library could
be re-licensed using the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lgpl.html">Lesser General Public License</a>
(LGPL).  Nikos Mavroyanopoulos from GNU TLS <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0301/msg00013.html">replied</a>
that this is up to its author, of course, and Jeff <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0301/msg00014.html">added</a> that
he is probably going to write native GNU TLS support for CUPS on his own.</p>

<p><strong>Random Requests to remove Packages.</strong> James Troup <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0301/msg00006.html">contacted</a> the
QA team since ftpmasters are receiving an increased amount of bug reports
asking for the removal of packages.  However, these requests didn't come from
their maintainers or the QA team but from random people who often aren't even
developers.  He doesn't feel comfortable with ftpmaster making the decision of
whether or not to remove packages.  Future requests for removal will be
discussed by the QA team.</p>

<p><strong>Porting OSCAR to Debian?</strong> Benoit des Ligneris <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0212/msg00046.html">wondered</a>
whether Debian would be interested in porting <a
href="http://oscar.sourceforge.net/">OSCAR</a>, a collection of userland
programs to do clustering, to the Debian system.  Current tools are mainly for
scientific computation purposes.  Benoit added a list of problems that need to
be resolved.  Interested people could easily join and work on them.</p>

<p><strong>Building GTK Applications for Windows on Debian.</strong> James
Michael DuPont sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-win32-0301/msg00000.html">call for
help</a> and requested support from the Debian community.  The <a
href="http://introspector.sourceforge.net/dia_win32.htm">goal</a> is to build
the <a href="http://www.lysator.liu.se/~alla/dia/dia.html">dia</a> application
for the W32 platform using Debian and the MingW32 cross-compiler.  He also
suggested to use the GTK port for W32 to build a graphical installer based on
GTK and the debian-installer.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on the X-box.</strong> If you are still looking for a cool
digital video recorder and home entertainment platform, the <a
href="http://www.xboxdeveloper.net/index.php?mode=viewproj&amp;id=245">\
Dreamix</a> project may be interesting for you.  Its goal is to bring Open
Source personal video recording, video and audio playback, and image viewing
capabilities to the X-box.  Although Dreamix will be based on Debian
X-box-Linux, all necessary libraries will be included in the distribution of
the CD image and will auto-execute after the CD is inserted into the X-box
DVD drive.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Privacy Notice Updated.</strong> We reported about a privacy
notice for Debian in our last issue.  It has since then been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0301/msg00177.html">pointed out</a>
that a <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/disclaimer">disclaimer</a> page already
exists for the Debian <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">mailing lists</a>,
and that this could be used as a template for a more general disclaimer or
privacy notice for many more things in Debian, such as the PTS (package
tracking system), BTS (bug tracking system) and others.  Any contributions to
this effort would be welcomed, e.g. as a follow-up to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0301/msg00007.html">above thread</a>.
A <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0211/msg00041.html">proposal</a>
was made for reviewing.</p>
