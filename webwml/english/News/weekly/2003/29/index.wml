<p>Welcome to this year's 29th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Linus Torvalds is working on pre-releases of Linux 2.6,
and Joseph Pranevich has published a guide to this new major release, <a
href="http://www.kniggit.net/wwol26.html">Wonderful World of Linux 2.6</a>.
This could mean that sarge will be released with a 2.6 kernel included.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Debian Packages.</strong> Joe 'Zonker' Brockmeier, a
former DWN editor, published an <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-debpkg.html">\
article</a> that describes the basics of creating Debian packages for
distributing programs and source code.  The article shows all the necessary
components of a package and how to put them together to end up with a final
product.</p>

<p><strong>LinuxTag Success.</strong> This year's LinuxTag, which took place
in Karlsruhe, Germany, was a great <a
href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/07/15/018235">success</a>.  With
more than 19,500 visitors, this year's LinuxTag has become the largest Linux
event in the world.  Amongst other things, the Debian developers in attendance
got <a href="http://dot.kde.org/1058415564/">together</a> for dinner with
both the KDE people and the GNOME people.</p>

<p><strong>ServerBeach runs Debian GNU/Linux Servers.</strong> <a
href="http://www.serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a> <a
href="http://thewhir.com/marketwatch/ser071603.cfm">announced</a> the
availability of their <a
href="http://www.serverbeach.com/catalog/debian_servers.php">Starter Servers
and Power Servers</a> with Debian GNU/Linux preinstalled.  Many customers want
and appreciate the two driving forces behind Debian - technical excellence and
commitment to Free Software, said Richard Yoo, Big Kahuna, ServerBeach.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Free Software Guidelines FAQ.</strong> Barak Pearlmutter <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0307/msg00122.html">composed</a> a
draft Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG) <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">FAQ</a>.  It is meant as an
introduction to issues discussed on the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">debian-legal</a> mailing list,
with some general background material to help bring new readers up to date.
Suggestions and comments are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>LGPL affecting Client Java Code?</strong> <a
href="http://slashdot.org/developers/03/07/17/2257224.shtml">According</a> to
this <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.jakarta.poi.devel/5900">article</a>,
Dave Turner of the FSF has decreed that the steps required to use
an LGPL'd Java library will actually infect client code with substantial
GNU-ness via Section 6 of the LGPL. (The "Lesser" GPL is supposed to protect
only the Library, without infecting code using the library) This, as you might
imagine, puts a few LGPL Java projects that previously thought they were
embeddable without being viral in a bit of a bind. <a
href="http://linuxintegrators.com/hl30/blog/general/?permalink=LGPL+clarification.html">\
Various</a> <a
href="http://www.rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20030716#for_java_lgpl_is_viral">\
weblogs</a> have <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1519.html">\
further</a> <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0122027/2003/07/16.html#a56">\
coverage</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Missing Timestamp Handling.</strong> Marcin Owsiany <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg01258.html">reported</a>
that when a source package is unpacked, all the files that have modifications
in the diff.gz file are given somewhat "random" timestamps, because patch
updates their timestamps as it processes the diff file.  This causes problems
for packages that rebuild their Makefiles on demand but don't build-depend on
autotools.</p>

<p><strong>Libpng Transition Status.</strong> Josselin Mouette <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg01271.html">reported</a>
that 84 binary packages remain that should be rebuilt before sarge
releases.  However, none is essential, but it insists that the more of those
are rebuilt, the less issues we will have later when libpng changes its soname
again.  The list of packages is attached to Josselin's mail.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Packages in a Chart.</strong> Bram Stolk <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg01302.html">announced</a>
that he has created a <a href="http://home.sara.nl/~bram/debchart.png">\
software map</a> of Debian packages.  The chart depicts all packages from
testing/main with 5 or more dependencies.  Instead of visualizing the
dependencies directly, a classification has been made.</p>

<p><strong>Working without a Release Roadmap?</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0307/msg01402.html">reported</a>
that the software in Debian 3.0 is currently roughly one and a half years old.
He adds that one release a year is badly needed and that a big system like
Debian doesn't become stable without a plan of how to achieve this.  He is
willing to help in QA and/or release management if this results in a new
stable release within less than a year.</p>

<p><strong>Unicode Character Database.</strong> Florian Weimer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0307/msg00056.html">reported</a>
that many packages that include a copy of parts of the Unicode Character
Database do not indicate the source and are thus violating its license.
Thomas Bushnell <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0307/msg00071.html">added</a> that
the next release of GNU miscfiles will include a version which really is
free.</p>

<p><strong>Creating Manpages from GNU FDL Documentation.</strong> Hans Fugal
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0307/msg00106.html">wondered</a>
if he is permitted to create a manpage from documentation that is released
under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free
Documentation License</a> (FDL) and which requirements he has to meet.  Walter
Landry <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0307/msg00108.html">\
answered</a> with a detailed ten-point list.</p>

<p><strong>Improving CD Mirrors.</strong> Mattias Wadenstein <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0307/msg00030.html">summarised</a>
suggestions for the CD image server and mirrors.  The plan is to provide both
images and jigdo files of CDs as well as testing images.  There was also a
request for a contrib-directory for <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> or a few more Knoppix
mirrors in US.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux as Commodity Software.</strong> Tim O'Reilly was
interviewed about the keynote at his company's Open Source Convention he gave.
During the <a
href="http://www.idg.com.sg/idgwww.nsf/unidlookup/363EE97CE7BBBBD848256D59000986BF?OpenDocument">\
interview</a> he hints that Debian founder Ian Murdock and his company Progeny
Linux Systems, Inc., have the right stuff for the future of computing.
Instead of seeing GNU/Linux as a product, he sees GNU/Linux as a set of
commodity software components he can put together for different purposes.</p>
