<br>Subject: miniwoody announcement

<p>miniwoody ver1.1 has been released. It has been build to offer a
Debian based Desktop-OS that fits on a 180MB CD-R(W). The Distribution
includes the current stable version of KDE 3.1.1 and has been modified
for easier installation. f.e. automatic hardware detection can easily
be installed durig the base-config process to make the X Window
Configuration much simpler.</p>

<p>Things that made the Debian installation uncomfortable in some kind of
ways have been redesigned to help even users that are completely new
to Linux to setup a working Linux Desktop in about 35 minutes. f.e
LiLO config can be rewritten on the fly to allow users to select Linux
single mode during startup.</p>
