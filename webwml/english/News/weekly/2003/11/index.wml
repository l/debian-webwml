<p>Welcome to this year's 11th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  For some time a French association (<a
href="http://www.april.org/">APRIL</a>) and the <a
href="http://fsffrance.org">Free Software Foundation France</a> have been
<a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/mankind/">working</a> on the
idea to have Free Software classified as an intangible world cultural
heritage term by the <a href="http://www.unesco.org/">UNESCO</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Leader Election Debate.</strong> This year's <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/vote_0001">election</a> <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/dpl-debate.log">debate</a> on IRC took place on March
7th with about 100 people <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/dpl-discuss.log">\
attending</a>.  After the candidates clarified their position the debate ended with
some humorous items.  Martin Michlmayr would probably win if only the
candidates could vote (and couldn't give their vote to themselves).  This seems
to demonstrate that Branden Robinson hasn't yet got his stated superpower of
choice, perhaps Bdale Garbee's amateur satellite counteracts the effects.
Moshe Zadka stated that he would like his term (if elected) to be remembered
for establishing world-peace, although he thinks that would be as unlikely as
the other candidates' goals.  Meanwhile, Manoj sent the second <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0303/msg00065.html">call for
votes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at the OpenOffice.org Conference.</strong> Chris Hall, Rene
Engelhard, and Jan-Hendrik Palic will be <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2003/20030314">representing</a> Debian at the <a
href="http://marketing.openoffice.org/conference/">OpenOffice.org
Conference</a> at the University of Hamburg, Germany on March 20/21.  Chris
will give a talk that introduces the process of making OpenOffice.org Debian
packages.  It will give an overview of the existing techniques used to build
OpenOffice.org and to integrate it into the operating system.  Also, he will
introduce some of the important tips, tricks, tools and resources for
packagers.</p>

<p><strong>Maintaining Fonts in Debian.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00494.html">talked</a> about
the Debian Font Manager (defoma) which was used to install fonts.  However
there is also fontconfig, which is a more generic way for applications to find
and use fonts, which is used by several applications already.  Emile van
Bergen <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00499.html">\
proposed</a> a smooth two-way transition that preserves defoma but still moves
towards fontconfig.</p>

<p><strong>Status report for Debian-Installer GTK-Frontend.</strong>
Sebastian Ley posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0303/msg00293.html">status
report</a> about the GTK frontend of the debian-installer.  Work has been done
to provide the necessary libraries as udebs, although the frontend is still
unusable.  A lot of debugging needs to be done and the concept of how the
GTK frontend will be integrated must be worked out and implemented.  This <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0303/msg00293.html">screenshot</a>
is not exactly eye-candy but it shows that progress is being made.  Help,
comments and discussion would be welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Making Mailing Lists available as Mailboxes.</strong> Josip Rodin <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0303/msg00149.html">wondered</a>
if Debian should publish the mbox files of the list archives on the
website.  This would reveal much more data for spammers to crawl through, which
could be good or bad: all the message-IDs would make spam databases less
useful, although it might cause people in Sender fields to be spammed.
Santiago Vila thought it was a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0303/msg00152.html">bad
idea</a> and suggested looking at the way the Geocrawler or Sourceforge lists
are handled.  Osamu Aoki (&#38738;&#26408; &#20462;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0303/msg00153.html">thought</a>
it depended upon how publication was done and suggested that using gzip
compression would be best.</p>

<p><strong>Standardizing PAM Policies.</strong> Sebastian Rittau <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00804.html">spoke</a> about
the lack of a PAM policy.  In his opinion most packages use PAM for
authentication in the wrong way.  They all install a configuration file in the
<code>/etc/pam.d/</code> directory that look similar to each other.  Steve
Langasek <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00816.html">\
prepared</a> a patch that adds support for an inclusion mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>LSB 1.3 Compliance?</strong> Gerhard Tonn <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00825.html">ran</a> the
latest LSB <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/test/">test suite</a> on woody
for S/390.  He used a modified glibc and pax as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0208/msg00103.html">described</a>
by Anthony Towns.  The results are very promising except that there are about
50 failures in the internationalization area which has been a part of the LSB since version
1.3.  This is caused by the fact that not all the relevant <a
href="http://www.openi18n.org/subgroups/utildev/dli18npatch2.html">patches</a>
are integrated into woody packages.  The same is true for sid.</p>

<p><strong>Potato Packages in Woody.</strong> Johann Glaser <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00828.html">wondered</a>
why still so many packages in woody (and sarge and sid) are linked from
potato.  His concerns resulted from a broken mirror that does not contain potato
anymore.  Not all packages have been updated since the release of potato and
hence are not using the pool structure yet.  This will change when potato gets
removed from the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>Is PHPNuke Free Software?</strong> John Goerzen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0302/msg00164.html">wondered</a> if
the important notice that has been added to the license of PHPNuke prohibits
modifications and derived works.  The author wants to have his copyright
notice visible in the footer of all pages that are rendered by PHPNuke.
Branden Robinson agreed and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0302/msg00167.html">added</a> that
the addition to the license is more restrictive than the BSD advertising
clause.</p>

<p><strong>Overview about IPv6 in Debian.</strong> Fabio Massimo Di Nitto <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6-0303/msg00005.html">announced</a> a
comprehensive <a href="http://debian.fabbione.net/stat/">web page</a> that
contains information about IPv6 support in Debian packages.  The idea
emerged to classify packages according to different criteria.  The <a
href="http://debdev.fabbione.net/cgi-bin/getstats">statistics</a> are
generated dynamically.</p>

<p><strong>New Accessibility Development.</strong> Mario Lang <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility-0302/msg00000.html">\
announced</a> the recently created <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility/">debian-accessibility</a>
list.  The list will help coordinate finding, identifying, discussing and
fixing accessibility related issues in the Debian Operating System.  It might
be related to the hearing impaired, to the sight impaired, or to people with
physical disabilities which for instance, limit their typing capabilities and
so on.</p>

<p><strong>Is the LPPL a Free License?</strong> Martin Pitt is packaging
<code>latex-ucs</code> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01010.html">wondered</a>
if the <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/lpll.txt">LaTex Project Public
License</a> (LPPL) combined with additional permissions from the author
satisfies the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidlines</a>.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01048.html">explained</a>
that no conclusion has been reached concerning this license.  However,
negotiations are ongoing between Debian and LaTex Project Developers and
Branden is confident that a mutually amicable arrangement will be
reached.</p>

<p><strong>Report about Debian at CeBIT exhibition.</strong> Alexander Schmehl
wrote a <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0312-cebit-report">report</a> about the
Debian booth at this year's CeBIT exhibition that was sponsored by <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/">LinuxLand</a>.  The booth was a big success
and many visitors stopped by.  Both, Alexander and Michael 'grisu' Bramer, who
staffed the booth, seemed to enjoy the opportunity to demonstrate the Debian
system during CeBIT.  Tomorrow (Wednesday) is the last day of CeBIT, so
interested people could still stop by in hall 6 at booth A52 / 182.</p>
