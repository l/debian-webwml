<p>Welcome to this year's fifth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Martin Michlmayr was <a
href="http://www.linux-fuer-alle.de/doc_show.php?docid=161">interviewed</a>
(German only) about the Debian project.  Jonathan Oxer told us that the Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0120-linuxconf">Mini-Conf</a> last week was a success
with 117 people attending.  Internet2 <a
href="http://archives.internet2.edu/guest/archives/I2-NEWS/log200301/msg00005.html">\
reported</a> that they have improved their previous speed <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020522">record</a> and transferred two DVD movies at
an average speed of more than 923 megabits per second.</p>

<p><strong>The Debian Init Script System.</strong> Alexander Wirt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01898.html">wondered</a>
why Debian doesn't make different use of the runlevels 3 to 5 and he suggested
a scheme including all seven runlevels.  Matthew P.  McGuire mentioned
the LSB, which <a
href="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/runlevels.html">\
specifies</a> how the runlevels should be used.  Henrique de Moraes Holschuh
disagreed that it would be simple to change the init script system and pointed
at his <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~hmh/debconf2/debconf2-initscripts-bkg.ps.gz">\
paper</a> in which he describes in detail the current system and his proposed
changes.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian Archive Key.</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0301/msg00009.html">\
announced</a> the <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/ziyi_key_2003.asc">\
archive key</a> for 2003, which is used to sign the Release file for the main,
non-US and security archives.  This key can be used with <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs">apt-check-sigs</a> to
protect your use of apt-get from malicious or exploited mirrors.  There are
other tools based on this that may be of interest, see Google or the
debian-security mailing list archives.  Colin Walters and a couple of others
have been working on integrating this into apt properly.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Games in Debian.</strong> Hwei Sheng Teoh <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg02039.html">offered</a> to
help any Debian Developers who look after games to fix common soundserver
related problems.  For example, the poor sound management of several games can
allow soundserver processes to linger after exit, infinitely chewing up CPU
power.  Steve Kemp has also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg02050.html">noticed</a> a
recurring problem with games not properly handling environment variables.</p>

<p><strong>User Input into the Project Leader Elections.</strong> Manoj
Srivastava, the Debian Project Secretary, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0301/msg00011.html">announced</a>
that this year's Project Leader debate on IRC will include user input.  A <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=902">discussion</a> has begun on
<a href="http://planet.debian.org/">Debian Planet</a> where people are
invited to pose questions or offer opinions.  The debate panelists will select
some of these questions to ask the candidates in the debate.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Logo on virtual Consoles.</strong> Dan McCombs wrote a <a
href="http://www.linuxorbit.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=548">\
howto</a> in which he describes how to use the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/linuxlogo">linuxlogo</a> for all virtual
consoles in order to display the Debian logo on them.  The Mini-Howto is
written merely for fun and the only purpose it serves is to make your computer
look cool.</p>

<p><strong>OpenOffice.org 1.0.2 for Woody.</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice-0301/msg00169.html">\
announced</a> that he has backported OpenOffice.org 1.0.2 to woody (stable)
using a backported GCC 3.2.1.  However, he warns that the <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/packages/">packages</a> are only lightly
tested and he would welcome any comments.  Version 1.0.2 is officially available
for i386, powerpc and s390 in Debian unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Vote on new Members for the SPI Board.</strong> Wichert Akkerman <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000042.html">\
called</a> for votes for <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/">\
new members</a> for the board of directors of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a>.
During the period from January 25 to February 7 (UTC) contributing members can
cast their vote <a href="https://members.spi-inc.org/vote/">online</a>.
People who become contributing members during this period are also eligible
to vote and all Debian developers who apply will become contributing
members automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Use in Nicaragua.</strong> Georg Lehner <a
href="mail#mail1">reported</a> that Debian is
spreading in Central America.  Three universities use Debian for routers and
servers.  A Debian workshop for system administrators from the biggest
university, Nacional Autónoma de Nicaragua-Managua, just finished.
The national engineering university <a href="http://www.uni.edu.ni/">UNI</a>
maintains a Debian <a href="http://debian.uni.edu.ni/">mirror</a> (i386) and
also recently has joined the <a href="http://www.linex.org/">LinEX</a>
project.</p>

<p><strong>Exim 4.12 for Debian.</strong> Sander Smeenk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01896.html">announced</a>
that he has created <a href="http://people.debian.org/~ssmeenk/exim-tls/">\
packages</a> for Exim-TLS 4.12.  He hesitates to upload them into Debian
because of problems that might arise when someone with an insanely difficult
exim-tls 3.xx configuration tries to upgrade.  Sander asks people to test the
packages and report problems and success.</p>

<p><strong>Removing the undocumented.7 Manual Page.</strong> Bas Zoetekouw <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00053.html">plans</a> to file
bug reports against all packages that still <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~bas/undocumented">contain</a>
undocumented.7.gz symlinks.  There are currently 693 binary packages in sid
that still use them.  This manpage is obsolete in the current <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/">policy</a>.

<p><strong>Project Leader Candidates.</strong> After Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0301/msg00006.html">announced</a>
the beginning of the project leader election procedure, two Debian
developers have nominated so far.  The first one was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0301/msg00008.html">Moshe Zadka</a>,
followed by <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00000.html">\
Bdale Garbee</a>.  Branden Robinson has not yet decided if he should run again
and is <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0302/msg00001.html">\
soliciting</a> specific feedback by means of the long questionnaire he
attached.</p>
