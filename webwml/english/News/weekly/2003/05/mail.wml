<br>Subject: Debian in Central America

<pre>
Debian is spreading in Central America.  In Nicaragua there are yet
three Universities, which employ Debian in servers and routers, see
<url "http://www.uni.edu.ni/">, <url "http://www.unan-leon.edu.ni/">,
<url "http://www.curn.edu.ni/">.

This week finishes a five day intensive workshop about Debian with the
participation of 15 system administrators of the biggest university
UNAN-Managua, with which it is expected that about four remote campus
spread over the whole national area will lauch themselves to the
Internet, also using Debian Gnu/Linux as there OS environment.

The national engineering University UNI, <url "http://www.uni.edu.ni/">
maintains a Debian mirror for the i386 architecture at
<url "http://debian.uni.edu.ni/">, and has recently joined also the LinEX
project <url "http://www.linex.org/"> for which it will provide a mirror "real
soon now".

Also one of the commercial Internet Providers, <url "http://www.netport.com.ni/">
has recently switched its servers from Windows NT to Debian Gnu/Linux,
while Magma Soft <url "http://www.magma.com.ni/"> [note of the author, that's
just my personal server] uses Debian since ever.
