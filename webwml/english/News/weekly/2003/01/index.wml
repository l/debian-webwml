# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's first issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Pretty much all of us are tired of the amount of spam
received.  Philip Jacob published a paper called <a
href="http://theory.whirlycott.com/~phil/antispam/rbl-bad/rbl-bad.html">The
Spam Problem: Moving Beyond RBLs</a>.  He describes Realtime Blackhole Lists
(RBLs) and lists specific problems with them.  Next he gets into ideas for
next generation antispam systems.  There's also a <a
href="http://www.spamconference.org/">Spam Conference</a> at MIT on Jan
17th.</p>

<p><strong>Improving the Visibility of Events.</strong> A <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0212/msg00008.html">\
call</a> for more active participation and preparation for Events with Debian
involvement was sent out.  The Debian project maintains several <a
href="$(HOME)/events/">web pages</a> dedicated to the events Debian attends.
These pages usually contain a small general paragraph describing the event and
a longer paragraph about the Debian participation.  There
are <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0130-lwce-report">summary</a> <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/1009-linuxexpo-report">reports</a> <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/1029-lwe-report">available</a> only for some events.  Hopefully, more
will be written for upcoming events.  Additionally Peter Karlsson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0212/msg00388.html">implemented</a>
ICS files (Internet Calendar entries) for all <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/">future events</a> in 2003.  Infodrom currently <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/calendar.html">lists</a> some of
the major GNU/Linux events coming up this year.</p>

<p><strong>RSS Feed of New Debian Packages Listing.</strong> Joe Nahmias informed us
that Andrew Cosgriff created an <a
href="http://polydistortion.net/urls/new-debian-packages.rss">RSS feed</a> of
new Debian packages, which is based on Randolph Chung's <a
href="http://auric.debian.org/~tausq/newpkgs.html">new packages</a> from the
last 7 days.  By the way this is also the source for the New and Noteworthy Packages
section in DWN.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian Business Cards.</strong> Jean-Michel Kelbert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg01078.html">informed</a> us
that he has placed a new flashy <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~kelbert/carte_debian_expo.png">business</a> <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~kelbert/carte_debian_expo.xcf">card</a>
online.  Martin Wuertele <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg01092.html">added</a> an
updated version of the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/materials/business-cards/traditional/">traditional</a>
business card.  The new versions were later added to the other <a
href="$(HOME)/events/materials/business-cards/">business cards</a> on the website.</p>

<p><strong>Perl Package requires Python.</strong> Kenneth Pronovici <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg01762.html">maintains</a> a
package for Debian that builds a <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/libxmltv-perl">perl
library</a>.  It sounds a little bit strange, but upstream added a new component that was written in
Python rather than in Perl.  Wouter Verhelst and Matt Zimmerman advised him to
split the source package into several binary packages, to keep the Perl
library and add a new Python package.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Conference 3.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0301/msg00001.html">\
announced</a> that there will be a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0718-debconf">Debian conference</a> in Europe, more
precisely in Oslo, Norway.  The University of Oslo has kindly offered to
host it.  A few days <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf3/debcamp.php">\
before</a> the conference rooms and network connectivity will be available, so
people will have time to sit around, discuss, hack, barbecue, go picnicking and
have fun.  If you are <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf3/callforpapers.php">interested</a> in
talking at <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf3/">Debconf</a> or have an
idea for a talk which you'd like to hear, please drop <a
href="mailto:tfheen@debian.org">Tollef</a> a mail.</p>

<p><strong>Egrep moved from /bin to /usr/bin.</strong> Jan Niehusmann <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00064.html">questioned</a>
if the recent move of egrep from <code>/bin</code> to <code>/usr/bin</code>
was a good idea.  It causes problems for packages with hard-coded paths to
egrep, such as logcheck.  Hwei Sheng Teoh <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00066.html">wondered</a>
whether he should file bugs against packages that have hard-coded the path or
reverse the change.  Matt Zimmerman <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00070.html">thought</a>
bugs should be filed, but Adam Heath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00162.html">thought</a>
egrep should be moved back to <code>/bin</code>.  Stephen Frost <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00072.html">suggested</a>
the proper solution would be to make egrep, fgrep and grep all the same binary.
This would solve the problem and satisfy any programs that need egrep or fgrep
before <code>/usr</code> is mounted.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up Debian Package Repositories.</strong> Aaron Isotton <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0301/msg00006.html">announced</a>
that he has written a <a
href="http://www.isotton.com/debian/docs/debian-repository-howto/">Debian
Repository Howto</a>.  The document explains what a Debian package repository
is, how it is designed, how it can be set up and used.</p>

<p><strong>DEC Word List removed from Aspell Dictionary.</strong> Kevin
Atkinson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0301/msg00007.html">announced</a>
that the DEC Word List has now been removed from the aspell English dictionary
due to the questionable license and because removing it will not seriously
decrease the quality.  This addresses licensing issues concerning the word
list that were <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00204.html">discussed</a>
last year.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Privacy Notice?</strong> Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0301/msg00007.html">wondered</a>
whether Debian should have a privacy notice displayed on the website.
Currently, there is no statement assuring people that the mailing list
subscriber databases are kept private and are not sold to marketers or
anything like that.  Santiago Vila <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0301/msg00008.html">considered</a>
this a good idea, but figured Debian should do more to fight spam on the lists
as a more urgent task.</p>

<p><strong>POSIX compliant su.</strong> Greg Stark <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00108.html">noticed</a>
that setting the variable <code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code> to 1 causes some
programs and installation scripts to fail due to unexpectedly getting
standards compliant behaviour instead of whatever the GNU programs usually do.
This is mostly <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00117.html">caused</a> by
<code>su</code> used in init scripts where <code>start-stop-daemon</code>
should be used.</p>

<p><strong>Moving Menu Files.</strong> Bill Allombert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0212/msg00172.html">noted</a> that
the menu system requires menu files to be in <code>/usr/lib/menu</code> for
historical reasons.  However, for <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">\
FHS</a> (File Hierarchy Standard) compliance they should be moved to
<code>/usr/share/menu</code>.  He suggested to upload a new menu package that
supports menu files in both directories.  Richard Braakman <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0212/msg00175.html">added</a> that
menu files are rather small and they could be copied into both locations for a
while.</p>

<p><strong>Changelog files in UTF-8.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00006.html">proposed</a>
an addition to the policy saying that the entire changelog file must be
encoded in the <a
href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/cgi-bin/rfc/rfc2279.html">UTF-8</a>
encoding from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">Unicode</a>.  Right now, people
are putting whatever random characters they feel like in Debian changelogs.
Radovan Garabik <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00022.html">added</a> that
such a proposal has been made at least twice in the past and was seconded
already.</p>

<p><strong>User Configuration Files.</strong> Jamin Collins <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00056.html">suggested</a>
to move user configuration files below <code>~/.etc</code> so they don't
clutter the home directory anymore.  This was also <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=1791001">discussed</a>
on the FHS list.  Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00061.html">explained</a>
that this would contradict with what the vast majority of the upstream
software we package does, and what that same software will do if people
compile it for themselves.  Lars Wirzenius would rather  <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00072.html">use</a> a time
machine to fix this in the 1970s, since it's too late now.</p>

<p><strong>LyX moved to main.</strong> <a href="http://www.lyx.org/">LyX</a>,
an almost WYSIWYG-frontend for LaTeX that runs under the X Window System, has
finally been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0212/msg02080.html">\
uploaded</a> into the main archive.  This was only possible after the formerly
non-free <a href="http://world.std.com/~xforms/">Xforms</a> GUI toolkit <a
href="http://bob.usuhs.mil/mailserv/list-archives/xforms-archive/0144.html">\
changed</a> its license to the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html">GNU Lesser General Public
License</a>, its 1.0-final version got released and <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0212/msg00704.html">\
uploaded</a> to main in mid-December.</p>

<p><strong>C++ Transition to GCC 3.2 ready.</strong> Ryan Murray <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0301/msg00002.html">\
announced</a> that the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~rmurray/c++transition.html">C++ transition
plan</a> for GCC 3.2 is ready to be implemented.  Because GCC 3.2 changed the
C++ ABI, you can't mix a C++ library compiled with GCC 3.2 and a C++
application compiled with an earlier version, or vice versa.  We're going to
rebuild all C++ packages with the gcc-3.2 ABI, except for libqt2, which will
be staying with the ABI it currently has for compatibility with woody and
third party binaries built with libqt2.  libqt3 will use the new ABI.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
