#use wml::debian::weeklynews::header PUBDATE="2003-06-17" SUMMARY="Automake, Kernels, Licenses, PNG Library, Testing, SPAM, Freedom, Birthday, Conference"
# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 24th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  A <a href="http://www.wewantlinux.org/pickcountry.php">\
survey</a> demonstrated a high level of <a
href="http://www.wewantlinux.org/responsereport.php">interest</a> in PCs preloaded with
GNU/Linux across the world.  Antonio Trueba Gayol <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0306/msg00012.html">\
discovered</a> a <a
href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/people/gregkh/penguin_sign.jpg">\
picture</a> taken by the Kernel developer Greg Kroah-Hartman which explains
the <a href="http://penguin.uk.linux.org/">story</a> of Tux and is believed to
originate from the Bristol Zoo (or the Canberra National Zoo and Aquarium).</p>

<p><strong>Removing Automake 1.5.</strong> Eric Dorland would like to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0306/msg00006.html">\
remove</a> automake 1.5 from Debian.  It is said to contain a lot of bugs and
is unsupported upstream.  Newer versions (1.6 and 1.7) can generally work with
Makefile.am files written for 1.5. Debian already ships
<code>automake1.4</code> <code>automake1.5</code>, <code>automake1.6</code>
and <code>automake1.7</code>. Eric would like to get rid of
<code>automake1.5</code> before <code>automake1.8</code> comes out.  However,
28 packages still define a dependency to this package.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling Kernels the Debian Way.</strong>  Jonathan Oxer <a
href="http://www.linmagau.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=158">explained</a>
how to compile Linux kernels the Debian way.  The Debian approach allows you
to compile your kernel and automatically build a Debian package around it.
This means you can install a custom kernel in the same way as you install any
other package.  Jonathan explains all the steps from getting the kernel
source to rebooting and testing your new kernel.</p>

<p><strong>A Single Unified License.</strong>  Richard Stallman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00142.html">discussed</a>
the goal of having a single license scheme that covers both software and
documentation, which goes beyond Richard's original purpose in writing the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.html">GNU licenses</a>.  It may or
may not be possible to design a license that is good for both Free Software
and free documentation, and that is close enough to today's General Public
License (GPL) that it qualifies as a successor version.  Richard intends to
make the effort some day, but will first finish GPL version 3, which faces
other difficult questions.</p>

<p><strong>The 'build' debian/rules Target.</strong>  Colin Walters made a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0306/msg00095.html">policy
proposal</a> to change <code>build</code> to an optional target, much like
<code>build-arch</code> and <code>build-indep</code> already are.  He agrees
that the <code>build</code> target is certainly useful for many packages.
But, as policy recognises, for some packages, notably ones where the same
source tree is compiled in different ways to produce two binary packages, the
<code>build</code> target does not make much sense.</p>

<p><strong>Oracle on Debian.</strong>  Alex Malinovich <a
href="http://www.the-love-shack.net/oracle-on-sid.html">described</a> his
experience installing Oracle 9i Developer Suite on Debian sid (unstable).
Overall, the installation is relatively painless.  The installer will handle most
of the process just fine, however there are a few caveats, which Alex deals
with in his article.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in the Spanish Administration.</strong> It is worth noticing
that in Spain, the <a href="http://www.map.es/">Ministerio para las
Administraciones Públicas</a> (roughly translated as "Ministry for Public
Administration") has published guidelines for <a
href="http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pdf/criterios/normas.pdf">standardisation</a>, <a
href="http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pdf/criterios/seguridad.pdf">security</a> and <a
href="http://www.csi.map.es/csi/pdf/criterios/conservacion.pdf">conservation</a>
of information.  All documents recommend the use of Debian as a free GNU/Linux
distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Ututo Router in Argentina.</strong> The Inquirer <a
href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=10011">reported</a> that public
schools in Buenos Aires, Argentina, are using the CD-based Ututo® "Ututo
Router" to connect to the Internet.  The Ututo distribution is specially
adjusted to work as a dedicated router to connect the schools local network to
the Internet.  <a href="http://www.ututo.org/">Ututo</a> is based upon Debian
and SuSE distributions.</p>

<p><strong>Using Auto Tools properly.</strong> Joey Hess wanted to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00545.html">know</a> how
<code>automake</code> and <code>autoconf</code> are best used for Debian
packaging.  His general rule is not to touch the generated files as long as
possible, but let them generate at build-time when they have to be altered
anyway.  Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00559.html">believes</a>
that the auto tools should never be run by the maintainer but only by the
upstream authority, though.</p>

<p><strong>PNG Library Version Update.</strong> Josselin Mouette <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00619.html">reported</a>
that he has uploaded new versions of <code>libpng</code> which have been built
with versioned symbols.  This means that, as soon as the necessary libraries
depending on them are rebuilt, one can build packages depending indirectly on
<code>libpng10</code> and <code>libpng12</code> simultaneously.</p>

<p><strong>C++ Toolchain in perfect Shape?</strong> Marcelo E. Magallon sent
out a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00632.html">thank
you</a> message to those who worked on the C++ toolchain.  For the first time
in many years he was able to compile a complex C++ program using templates and
a couple of external libraries on a Debian (unstable) machine and it ran on a
machine with SuSE 8.2.  There was a time when not even a simple "Hello,
World!" in C would accomplished this.</p>

<p><strong>Testing built Packages.</strong> Christophe Barbé <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00642.html">proposed</a> to
test packages at build-time, especially if they are auto-built, since some of
his packages compiled fine but turned out to be broken.  Such tests would
improve the quality and were most probably already discussed in older QA
(quality assurance) meetings.  Dan Jacobowitz <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00655.html">noted</a>
that such checks should just be added in a <code>check</code> target which
would be evaluated between the build and the packaging stage.  Ben Collins <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00668.html">added</a> that
this is already implemented for GCC and GlibC.</p>

<p><strong>Every SPAM is sacred...</strong> Santiago Vila <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00667.html">started</a> a
discussion about how the Debian admin people refuse to add Realtime Block
Lists (RBL) to debian.org mail servers.  They argue that Debian was listed in one or more
of them innocently already, which proved that those lists are not trustworthy
enough.  Theodore Ts'o <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00673.html">added</a>
that he doesn't want to delegate to someone else the power to say whether or
not a very large number of people will see mail from a particular host or
network.  Noah Meyerhans <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00778.html">pointed
out</a> the warning header could aid client side filtering.</p>

<p><strong>Debian's Five Freedoms for Free Works.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00100.html">published</a>
an essay about five freedoms intended to apply to non-public-domain works in
general.  They are conforming with the FSF's <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">definition</a> and include
the freedom to use the work for any purpose and adapt it to one's needs, which
implies access to the form of the work which is preferred for making
modifications (i.e. source).  They also include the freedom to redistribute
altered and pristine copies of the work.  Branden personally advocated a fifth
freedom to retain privacy in one's person, effects, and data.</p>

<p><strong>Schedule for the Debian Day.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2003/day.html">schedule</a>
for the Debian Day has been fixed, assuming that the times will please the speakers and
no talks need to be moved. The Debian Day will take place on Friday, July
11th, during <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a> in Karlsruhe.
The conference begins with developer-oriented talks and a success story,
continues with user-oriented talks and finishes with two talks targeted at
active and prospective developers.  More talks with a Debian focus will take
place outside of this one-day conference.</p>

<p><strong>Birthday Coordination Page.</strong> With Debian's 10th birthday
approaching on August 16th, people have been asking on various mailing lists
if any parties are planned (see our <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2003/23/">last issue</a>).  To make it easier to
find events in the local area a 10th birthday party <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/10years/">coordination page</a> has been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg01019.html">started</a>.
If you know of an event in your local area please go to the page and submit
the details if it's not listed already.</p>

<p><strong>European Open Content License.</strong> The German <a
href="http://www.ifross.de/">Institute for Legal Issues on Free and Open
Source Software</a> has developed an <a
href="http://www.uvm.nrw.de/kunden/uvm/www.nsf/0/DE4F7A151230FB66C1256D39002813AD?OpenDocument">\
Open Content License</a>.  It is based on the ideas emphasised in the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a> and
was adjusted especially for the law system of Germany and Europe.</p>

<p><strong>Department of Defense Issues Open Source Policy.</strong> Thor
Olavsrud <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/2216311">\
wrote</a> that the U.S. Department of Defense has distributed a memo putting
Open Source software on a level playing field with proprietary software when
it comes to use within the department.  However, the memo also warned that
those using Open Source software must comply with "lawful licensing
requirements" and be aware of what those licenses entail.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendation for Migration in Germany.</strong> The German <a
href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/">Federal Ministry of the Interior</a> is about
to release a <a
href="http://www.bmi.bund.de/dokumente/Pressemitteilung/ix_92264.htm?nodeID=3735">\
recommendation paper</a> that demonstrates how to use Free Software in
governmental agencies.  However, each agency will still have to decide on
their own whether to use Free Software or something else.  The paper will be
<a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2003/de/conferences/talk.xsp?id=64">\
discussed</a> in detail at <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>
next month in Karlsruhe, Germany.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for GTK Frontend.</strong> Sebastian Ley <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0306/msg00139.html">asked</a> for
suggestions with respect to the GTK frontend for cdebconf.  Plans were to base
the frontend on the framebuffer library libdirectfb.  First efforts were
successful and basic functions could be implemented.  However, it is
currently not possible to start a shell and to provide the user with an error
log.</p>

<p><strong>Depressing Bug Statistics for Base.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0306/msg00002.html">noticed</a> that
there are still way too many <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/~tbm/base_bugs.png">bugs</a> reported against
packages in the base system.  He thinks that Debian should promote
co-maintainership for important packages and try to get people to submit
patches for open bugs to help the maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages to remove.</strong> Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0306/msg00007.html">reported</a> that
he is making a series of passes over the list of orphaned packages, looking
for ones which can be removed.  The first list attached to his mail is
comprised of those packages which are now completely obsolete, for one reason
or another.  He intends to ask ftp-master to remove them.</p>

<p><strong>Infrastructure for Meta-Distribution Projects.</strong> Jeremy
Malcolm <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-lex-0306/msg00006.html">\
asked</a> about the experience of sub-projects to get some ground-rules sorted
out before he makes too many irreversible decisions for <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~terminus/debian-lex/">debian-lex</a>.  In
particular he has looked at the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">\
debian-jr</a> sub-project and their use of meta packages.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
