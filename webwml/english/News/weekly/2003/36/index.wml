# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 36th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  <a href="http://www.rioaudio.com/">Rio Audio</a> announced
the <a
href="http://www.digitalnetworksna.com/shop/_templates/item_main_Rio.asp?model=220&amp;cat=35">\
Rio Karma 20</a>, which seems to be the first industrially manufactured
digital audio player that supports the Ogg Vorbis audio format.  In 
light of the recent software patents debate members of the German <a
href="http://www.debianforum.de/">Debianforum</a> signed an  <a
href="http://www.debianforum.de/wiki/OffenerBrief">open letter</a> directed at
the European Parliament.</p>

<p><strong>Not just another pretty Face.</strong> Robert Storey, a
self-confessed Debian convert wrote a <a
href="http://www.distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-debian">review</a>
about his successful installation experience.  He explains that a good package
management system should not only inform you about unmet dependencies but even
better, it should just fix the problem for you without asking.  He continues
with a section about "Post Install Configuration" which includes many details
such as APM and framebuffer configuration, which many installation articles do
not mention.</p>

<p><strong>Latest Versions of Webmagick and Imagemagick.</strong> Keith
Goettert wrote a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0309/msg00137.html">tutorial</a> on
installing and using the latest version of <a
href="http://webmagick.sourceforge.net/">Webmagick</a> and <a
href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">Imagemagick</a> from source.  He had to use
more recent versions since Debian 3.0 ships older packages that work slower
but consume more memory.</p>

<p><strong>Placing System generated Programs?</strong> Russell Coker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00081.html">wondered</a>
where a package should place programs that are automatically generated and
run.  The <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a> (FHS) is not clear on whether it is OK to put a script in
<code>/var/run</code>.  This and <code>/var/lib/package/</code> seem to be the
only options.</p>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL 7.4beta2 for Debian.</strong> Oliver Elphick <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00121.html">announced</a>
Debian packages of PostgreSQL 7.4beta2 which he has uploaded into the
experimental archive.  The packages may not be visible for a while because
there are some new binary packages that need to be authorised by the archive
maintainers.</p>

<p><strong>Future of Libwww?</strong> Richard Atterer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg00123.html">reported</a>
that the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> has stopped work on <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/">Libwww</a> and invites the libwww user
community to participate in a Future of Libwww <a
href="http://www.w3.org/Library/Survey2">survey</a> that will help to
determine its future.  Libwww is a free, highly modular client side Web API.
A public W3C <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/MemberAccess/Public">account</a> is
required to complete the survey.</p>

<p><strong>Free Software requiring non-free Build Tools.</strong>  Matt
Zimmerman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00184.html">wondered</a>
how <a href="http://tvtime.sourceforge.net/">tvtime</a> should be packaged.
It can use binary modules from <a
href="http://deinterlace.sourceforge.net/about.htm">DScaler</a>, which are
free, but currently only compilable by non-free tools.  Matt thought that the
binary DLLs could go in contrib, because the source code is free.  Branden
Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00188.html">agreed</a>,
summarising that packages in main must be entirely free and must be buildable
and usable solely with other packages also in main.  Free packages with
non-free dependencies or build-dependencies can go into contrib.</p>

<p><strong>New Package Dependency Field Format.</strong>  Adam Heath has been
working on a rewrite of <code>dpkg</code> and has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0309/msg00000.html">proposed</a>
a number of changes to the dependency parser, including the addition of the !=
operator and full nestable parenthetical expression support.  Jason Gunthorpe
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0309/msg00014.html">explained</a>
that <code>APT</code> would need huge amounts of effort to support the
changes, but it would not solve any actual problems.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dpkg-0309/msg00028.html">thought</a>
the changes would require a major rewrite of the logic of the testing scripts
for no real gain.</p>

<p><strong>Would the GNU Project endorse Debian?</strong>  In response to
Branden Robinson's <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00135.html">questioning</a>,
Richard Stallman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00162.html">explained</a>
that the GNU Project won't endorse Debian, because non-free packages are
distributed on our servers.  Richard explained that if Debian distributes
main from a server that doesn't include or refer people to non-free software
and documentation, the GNU project could point to Debian as an entirely free
version of the GNU system.  However, they could not endorse it in glowing
terms if documentation is excluded when it is released under the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">Free Documentation License</a>
(FDL).</p>

<p><strong>Debian and the FSF.</strong>  Bruce Perens <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg00091.html">thought</a>
it was time to step in between Debian and the Free Software Foundation (FSF)
regarding the debate over non-free stuff in Debian and the FDL.  He claimed
that saying "non-free isn't really part of Debian" is a fiction.   He urged
Debian to make it true by giving non-free and contrib their own organisation.
He also suggested that the FSF should assert that documentation is an
essential component of Free Software, and that it must be under essentially
the same terms as its associated software.</p>

<p><strong>Politics in Free Software.</strong>
Tom Chance <a
href="http://www.newsforge.com/article.pl?sid=03/09/02/1930234&amp;mode=thread&amp;tid=51">\
reported</a> about a developer who credited a certain army in four of his
applications, their removal and the <a
href="http://dot.kde.org/1062275899/">small storm</a> in the community.  He
said that "some organisations, like Debian, have put a lot of effort into defining
exactly how the community handles political and social relations, so
that responsibility and authority is clearly and justly assigned, and
decision-making processes are clearly and justly defined."  He would like
Free Software communities to take political and social considerations more
seriously, since we should not continue with large numbers
of people believing that politics has no place in Free Software, or that
burying one's head in the sand is a wise way to work.</p>

<p><strong>Security Scanning with Debian based Tools.</strong>
Victor Garza and Joseph Roth <a
href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/03/09/05/35TCvuln_1.html">tested</a>
<code>Nessus</code> using <a
href="http://www.knoppix-std.org/">Knoppix-STD</a>, a Security Tools
Distribution. The ease of gathering
up-to-date vulnerability information and scripts, the passive,
non-destructive scanning mode,  and the fact that  Nessus
also supports a PKI of sorts, using a certificate for authentication,
were features they liked.  They said that
"<a href="http://www.nessus.org/">Nessus</a> does the job of identifying
vulnerabilities and recommending fixes,
and the Knoppix/Nessus combination goes a long way toward making the scanner
easy to use." However, reporting the results of the security scan in a clear, concise and
foolproof manner was <a href="http://www.nessus.org/demo/third.html">one
area</a> they found lacking.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on NordicOS.</strong> Debian GNU/Linux is listed on <a
href="http://www.nordicos.org/programs/all/debian/">NordicOS</a>, a project of
the Nordic Ministerial Council, which addresses the need for a comprehensive
overview of open source software available for consumers.  The item refers to
several official documents from Debian and accentuated that Debian is a
completely non-commercial project, perhaps the purest form of the ideals that
started the Free Software movement.</p>

<p><strong>Guide for Greek Debian Users.</strong> Konstantinos Margaritis <a
href="http://www.ellak.gr/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpWiki&amp;file=index&amp;pagename=DebianGuideEn">\
announced</a> the new Greek <a
href="http://www.ellak.gr/pub/OpenGuides/Debian/debianguide.html">Debian
User's Guide</a> which he wrote.  It deals with most aspects of installing
Debian GNU/Linux version 3.0 and many aspects of everyday use and
administration.  The guide has been released under the FDL and is available in
many popular document formats.  A printed version is planned as well.</p>
