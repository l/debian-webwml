# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's sixth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  A recent <a
href="http://www.gnomedesktop.org/article.php?sid=908">announcement</a> on a
GNOME list says that GNOME and KDE are joining the <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/">Free Desktop</a> Project to create Human
Interface Guidelines for both desktop environments.  Additionally, the <a
href="http://www.liniso.de/tde/">Turbo Desktop Environment</a> aimed at users
with older computers who still want to run a proper desktop.  It is based on KDE 1
and Debian.  There is more good news on the desktop front as KDE 3.1 is being <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0302/msg00188.html">uploaded</a> into
Debian unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at the World Social Forum.</strong> Debian was <a
href="http://fsm2003.softwarelivre.org/">represented</a> at the
World Social Forum in Brazil
by <a href="http://www.debian-rs.org/">Debian-RS</a>, a local Debian users
group.  They were asked to build the computer network for the 
youth camp during the event.  They
were also invited to give more than 10 workshops, with technical, political
and social focus.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and OASIS.</strong> Last April, Debian joined the <a
href="http://www.oasis-open.org/">Organization for the Advancement of
Structured Information Standards</a> (OASIS).  Mark Johnson, Debian's official
representative to OASIS, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00348.html">asked</a> for
feedback from any Debian Developers who have been involved in OASIS Technical
Committees.  He would also like ideas on how he should seek input from
Developers before casting Debian's vote in OASIS decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Debian joins Desktop Linux Consortium.</strong> The Debian project
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2003/20030207">announced</a> that it is a founding
member of the new <a href="http://www.desktoplinuxconsortium.org/">Desktop Linux
Consortium</a> (DLC).  DLC is a vendor-neutral
association, comprised of both commercial companies and open source
organizations that are developing and shaping GNU/Linux desktop technologies.
The non-profit association will help shape the future of GNU/Linux on the
desktop, targeting the needs of corporate, institutional, and home users.</p>

<p><strong>Debian powers Home Entertainment Gateway Device.</strong> A <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT9943738185.html">report</a> on
LinuxDevices.com about the PRISMIQ <a
href="http://www.prismiq.com/products/">MediaPlayer</a>, a networked
entertainment gateway, says that it runs an embedded version of Debian
GNU/Linux.  Priced at just $250, the gadget delivers audio and video media
files, obtained from either home PCs or the Internet, to TVs and stereos.  The
<a href="http://www.prismiq.com/products/techspecs.htm">device</a> contains an
embedded computer based on a 32-bit MIPS microprocessor with integrated MPEG
decoder, along with 16&nbsp;MB Flash and 64&nbsp;MB SDRAM.</p>

<p><strong>Selecting Tasks and Packages.</strong> Osamu Aoki (&#38738;&#26408; &#20462;) <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00273.html">reviewed</a>
the current package installation system and concluded that there is dselect,
aptitude and apt-get to install single packages (out of a list of roughly
8700) and tasksel that selects some out of thirty tasks.  He wondered whether
there is any activity to address this gap.  His proposed solution uses additional
attributes in the package description.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling Debian packages with DJGPP.</strong> Jeremie Koenig <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00299.html">plans</a> to
try compiling some Debian packages for FreeDOS using DJGPP, a DOS port of GCC,
featuring a libc granting reasonable API compatibility with programs
originating from the Unix world.  He admits that the debian-djgpp idea sounds
odd, but for old or embedded machines this could open up a large quantity of
software.</p>

<p><strong>Freeze Plans?</strong> Barak Pearlmutter <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00302.html">asked</a> for a
distribution freeze soon.  Anthony Towns <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00319.html">explains</a>
that there are a bit over 1700 source packages that are nominally ready for
testing right now.  They are being held back by various libraries and such
(glibc, Perl, Python, C++, GTK, KDE, etc).  That is about a quarter of
Debian.  For the past five months or so, testing has been working "correctly"
but only in so far as unstable hasn't been. Testing has no value if Debian
can't provide functional software in unstable on a fairly regular basis.</p>

<p><strong>Security for Testing.</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00359.html">revealed</a>
that the infrastructure for adding security updates to the testing
distribution is in place, in fact even since the new security architecture came
into being.  However, Matt Zimmerman <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00477.html">pointed out</a>
that somebody needs to review the packages and the process and clean up the
mess if maintainers upload broken packages.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with Qt3 Packaging.</strong> Ralf Nolden <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00329.html">reported</a>
about severe problems in the way Qt3 is currently packaged.  Several issues
haven't been dealt with and the maintainer still isn't listening.  Ivan Moore even <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00330.html">regretted</a>
to having given away the package.  Finally cooperation with the maintainer was
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00450.html">reached</a>
again and updated packages are expected soon.  This involves a number of <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0302/msg00281.html">changes</a> and
the maintainer sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00527.html">status</a>
report.</p>

<p><strong>Boot-Floppies Status Report.</strong> Eduard Bloch has been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0212/msg00798.html">working</a> on
new boot-floppies for the 3.0r2 update of woody (stable).  He <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0302/msg00178.html">reported</a>
that boot-floppies 3.0.24 are almost ready.  Packages for most architectures
have been built and tested, although some issues remain with the sparc, s390
and arm architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Shared Libraries Policy.</strong> Marco d'Itri <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0302/msg00046.html">proposed</a>
two small changes to policy regarding shared libraries and PIC code.  First,
compiling with -fPIC is not enough to have PIC code, the object must not have
a TEXTREL section either.  Second, libraries should be allowed to contain
short sections of non-PIC code on suitable architectures if this allows a
significant speed increase.</p>

<p><strong>Mandrake Linux without MandrakeSoft?</strong> Some Mandrake
volunteers and developers are <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cooker@linux-mandrake.com/msg90098.html">\
discussing</a> the future of Mandrake Linux since Ben Reser <a
href="http://archives.mandrakelinux.com/cooker/2003-01/msg03850.php">\
believes</a> that the end of <a href="http://www.mandrakesoft.com/">\
MandrakeSoft</a> is <a
href="http://ben.reser.org/rants/invisible.cgi?month=01&amp;day=15&amp;year=2003&amp;t=00">\
inevitable</a>.  They <a
href="http://archives.mandrakelinux.com/cooker/2003-01/msg04630.php">\
proposed</a> to organise Mandrake Linux development as community effort and <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cooker@linux-mandrake.com/msg90243.html">\
investigated</a> how the Debian project is organised, which is why John
Goerzen from Debian <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cooker@linux-mandrake.com/msg90522.html">\
contributed</a> to the discussion.  Gustavo Franco, for example, <a
href="http://www.mail-archive.com/cooker@linux-mandrake.com/msg90668.html">\
proposed</a> Mandrake as a new project inside Debian under the umbrella of
Software in the Public Interest, Inc.  However, this idea was refused.</p>

<p><strong>New APT prepared.</strong> Adam Heath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00534.html">announced</a>
that he has prepared <a href="http://people.debian.org/~doogie/apt/">APT</a>
0.5.4.9.  The new version includes higher limits and finally uses translatable
strings.  He also recompiled APT with g++ 3.2.  Because of this Adam likes to
make certain this version works on all architectures.  He would also like
translators to check out APT from <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/apt/po/?cvsroot=APT+%28%2Fcvs%2Fdeity%29">CVS</a>,
and send translated files to the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/deity/">\
deity</a> list.  Additionally, Daniel Burrows prepared new <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~dburrows/aptitude/">packages</a> for aptitude.</p>

<p><strong>Investigating System Users.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00557.html">reports</a>
about a <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/25882">problem</a> with the three
users sync, games and man.  All of them currently have their primary group
set to 'users', which is currently gid 100.  The discussion got sidetracked
into whether users should have gid 100 at all.  He also compared the situation
to other Free Software distributions.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Multimedia Project.</strong> Marco Trevisani <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00567.html">reports</a>
that <a href="http://www.demudi.org/">DeMuDi</a> has reached release 0.9
and he believes that it's time to start a Debian-Multimedia project within
Debian.  He would like to start a formal discussion and seek opinions from
Debian maintainers, especially those that would be directly
involved.  In order to help, Ben Armstrong added a pointer to the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~synrg/subproject-howto.html/">subproject
howto</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Hexdump, Hexcat and Hextype?</strong> Michael Piefel <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00605.html">wondered</a>
why Debian contains <a href="http://packages.debian.org/bsdmainutils">\
hexdump</a> and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hexcat">hexcat</a>, just
before he <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00610.html">learnt</a> that
there is also <a href="http://packages.debian.org/hextype">hextype</a>.  Gerd
Knorr <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00626.html">\
added</a> that hexdump is very flexible, and Richard Braakman finally <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg00628.html">compared</a>
the speed differences of all three.</p>

<p><strong>Legal Analysis of Open Source Licenses.</strong> Jeremy Malcolm,
Debian Developer and IT Lawyer, presented a paper titled <a
href="http://www.ilaw.com.au/public/licencearticle.html">Problems in Open
Source Licensing</a> at the recent <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/">Australian
Linux Conference</a>.  The paper analyzes some common Open Source licenses,
such as the GNU <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public
License</a> and the <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5">BSD License</a>.  Jeremy
points out some possible legal pitfalls regarding these licenses and suggests
strategies for overcoming them.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling Debian with a non-GNU compiler?</strong> Bob McElrath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha-0302/msg00011.html">inquired</a>
about putting packages compiled with a non-free compiler such as HP's ccc into
the Debian archives.  Non-free compilers sometimes produce faster executables
than gcc.  However several posters noted with recent versions of gcc 3.x the gap
is smaller.  Apart from the philosophical problems with having software in
Debian compiled with a non-free tool chain, there are various legal and
technical problems included, such as licensing terms of non-free compilers sometimes
prohibit distribution of the resulting binaries and others.</p>

<p><strong>Knoppix reviewed at IBM developerWorks.</strong> Cameron Laird
published an <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-knopp.html?ca=dgr-lnxw83Knoppix">\
article</a> about Knoppix, the single CD GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian.  If you've ever
needed a functional Linux setup that is portable and runs the same way on any
hardware, read his article.  <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">\
Knoppix</a> packages a specialized and highly useful GNU/Linux distribution on
a single, bootable CD-ROM.</p>
