<p>Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  It seems to have been a <a
href="http://kerneltrap.org/node.php?id=603">big week</a> in Linux kernel
development.  Recent work promises to make exciting improvements for desktop
users.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.openstuff.net">Openstuff.net</a> has
recently released a new range of low cost <a
href="http://openstuff.net/index.py/categ/categ/3">Debian fun stuff</a>,
including t-shirts, polo shirts, sweat shirts and suitcases.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Votes in the DPL Election.</strong> The Debian Project
Secretary <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0303/msg00033.html">posted</a> the
first call for votes this year's Election of the Debian Project Leader (DPL).
Last year's voting engine, which is relatively well tested, will be used
again.  The order of candidates names on the voting form was randomly selected
and voters may indicate their preference for each candidate.  Votes must be
GnuPG (or PGP) signed and received by 23:59:59 UTC on March 29th, 2003.  Up to
the minute voting statistics are <a
href="http://master.debian.org/~srivasta/leader2003.html">available</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Using translated debconf Templates.</strong> Michael Bramer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01924.html">informed</a> us
about the possibility to use of translated debconf templates that the <a
href="http://ddtp.debian.org/">Debian Description Translation Project</a>
maintains.  Several languages are supported and progress can be watched at the
<a href="http://ddtp.debian.org/debconf/gnuplot/ddts-stat.png">progress
graph</a>.  Michael <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00189.html">summarized</a>
the discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Testing GCC 3.3.</strong> Matthias Klose <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00025.html">called</a> for
testing of the upcoming GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 3.3 with real-world
applications.  Before this version is released, it has to meet several <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/criteria.html">criteria</a>.  Packages should
be recompiled with gcc-snapshot from unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Release Schedule for Sarge?</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00007.html">\
talks</a> about issues that Debian will be facing soon, now that glibc from
unstable migrated into testing.  He wonders whether debian-installer is in an
acceptable state, and if not, what is necessary to get it (or something else)
suitable for release, and how long will that take?  Anthony is also looking
for volunteers to help with Release Manager work.</p>

<p><strong>Qmail on Debian.</strong> Vincent Hillier has written an <a
href="http://www.pantz.org/email/qmail/qmailondebian.shtml">article</a> that
details the use of qmail on Debian systems.  The document explains the
deployment of the Qmail mail server in numerous situations.  No previous
knowledge of Qmail is necessary, as the paper describes every step from
installation to running POP and DNS on the same machine.</p>

<p><strong>Compiling the Linux Kernel on Debian.</strong> Clinton De Young,
author of <a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=2016">The Very
Verbose Debian 3.0 Installation Walkthrough</a>, has now written <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=2949">The Very Verbose Guide to
Updating and Compiling Your Debian Kernel</a>.  This article guides even
novice users through the steps of downloading, configuring, compiling and
installing the Linux kernel.  It includes a discussion of things such as sound
support, ext3 journaling and CD burning.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Debian on a Compaq Proliant.</strong> <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org">DebianHelp</a> carries an <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3140">article</a>
that discusses the installation of Debian 3.0 (woody) on a Compaq Proliant
ML370 G3 with dual Intel Xeon 2.8&nbsp;GHz processors and 2&nbsp;GB of RAM.  It
explains which drivers are required and how to ensure that all hardware is
recognized and operating properly.</p>

<p><strong>Accessibility Features in Debian.</strong> A user on <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org">DebianHelp</a> explained that he is paralyzed
and uses the accessibility features of a proprietary operating system,
including sticky keys and mouse keys to manage the modifying keystrokes and
using the number-pad as a mouse control.  He <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB_14&amp;file=index&amp;action=viewtopic&amp;topic=844&amp;forum=23">wondered</a>
what accessibility features Debian provides.  Readers pointed out the <a
href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Accessibility-HOWTO/index.html">Linux
Accessibility Howto</a> and the accessibility features of GNOME and KDE3.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on a Low Cost Lindows/Microtel Box.</strong> Paul M. Foster
<a
href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/03/03/02/190256.shtml?tid=7">explained</a>
how he converted a low cost Lindows computer from <a
href="http://www.walmart.com/catalog/catalog.gsp?cat=3951&amp;lr=A&amp;dept=3944&amp;path=0%3A3944%3A3951">Wal-Mart</a>
into a proper Debian system.  Paul first wiped Lindows from the hard drive and
then installed Debian 3.0 (woody).  However, after experiencing several
hardware incompatibility issues, he upgraded to testing (sarge) to solve his
problems.</p>

<p><strong>Graphing Private Woody Archives.</strong> Brian May <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00401.html">created</a> a
Perl script that compares the sources file from a Debian archive and a
private archive.  The script outputs a list of nodes for producing a <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/graphics/vcg.html">vcg</a> graph that
shows build dependencies for the private archive.  The graph shows which
packages are out of date in a private archive and the order in which they
should be rebuilt.  For example, the graph might show that while
<code>acl</code> is out of date, <code>attr</code> should probably be rebuilt
first because <code>acl</code> depends on <code>attr</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing LZW Code back into Debian.</strong> Drew Scott Daniels <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00334.html">wondered</a>
about the best way to approach the <a
href="http://groups.google.com/groups?&amp;threadm=a5aa8dd0.0208271613.3cd18da6%40posting.google.com">pending
expiry</a> of patent protection on the LZW algorithm.  He would like to find
out which packages had, have, or could benefit from using LZW code.  He
proposes to do a mass bug filing to encourage the use of LZW code,
particularly against packages that have purposely removed LZW code.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Detection Packages in Debian.</strong> Rick Moen, Dave
Bechtel and Heather Stern of the Linux Gazette Answer Gang recently <a
href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue88/tag/2.html">discussed</a> hardware
detection packages in Debian.  They answered questions about <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/kudzu.html">kudzu</a> and
discussed Debian's numerous packages for hardware recognition.  Rick has
integrated the hardware recognition information into his <a
href="http://linuxmafia.com/debian/tips">Debian tips</a> page.</p>

<p><strong>Dependencies in the Debian Archive.</strong> Osamu Aoki (&#38738;&#26408; &#20462;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00285.html">thought</a>
that one measure of the importance of a Debian package is the number of other
packages that depend on it.  His research showed that 88% of packages had
dependencies with less than 6 other packages.  Fabio Massimo Di Nitto <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00293.html">pointed</a> out
that the statistics overlook Essential status packages and Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00302.html">noted</a> that
some packages are less depended upon, but equally important because they
provide the same function, such as a mail-transport-agent.</p>

<p> <strong>Using Udebs for More Than Installation.</strong>  Branden Robinson
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0302/msg00636.html">asked</a>
about using udebs for more than the installer, for example in resource
constrained environments.  Glenn McGrath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0302/msg00645.html">explained</a>
that from a file format viewpoint udebs are the same as debs, except udebs can
be smaller because they don't have to include everything required by Debian
package policy.  One should think of udebs as dynamically loadable installer
modules, not as true Debian packages. </p>

<p><strong>Debian Based GNU/Linux for PlayStation 2.</strong> <a
href="http://www.xrhino.com/">xRhino</a> has released <a
href="http://blackrhino.xrhino.com/main.php?page=home">BlackRhino</a> for the
Sony PlayStation 2 (PS2).  BlackRhino is a Debian based GNU/Linux operating
system.  It contains over 1,200 software packages to aid in using and creating
programs for the PS2 and requires Sony's <a
href="http://www.us.playstation.com/purchase/hardware/">PS2 Linux Kit</a>,
which sells for $US199.</p>

<p><strong>New Experimental PPP Package.</strong> Russell Coker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00449.html">announced</a>
that he has made <a href="http://www.coker.com.au/ppp/">available</a> a new
experimental PPP package.  among other things, it includes Brian May's dialer
script.  Russell is currently not in a position to test the package and would
appreciate any testing assistance.  In the next day or two, Russell intends to
put another test release online with pppoa support and then by the end of the
week he may have an upload with pppoa and many of the other things people are
clamoring for.</p>

<p><strong>New OpenLDAP 2.1 Preview.</strong> Torsten Landschoff <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg00412.html">announced</a>
that the first trial package of a ready-to-install OpenLDAP 2.1 is now <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~torsten/openldap2.1/">available</a>.  A lot of
work remains before an unstable upload, for example upgrades do not work and
reconfiguration depends on removing the old directory first.  However,
installing seems to work and a new directory can be created using a very
simple configuration script.  Torsten would appreciate testing and feedback,
including wanted features in the final maintainer scripts.</p>

<p><strong>Licensing Clarification on GnuMICR Font.</strong> Eric Sandeen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0303/msg00058.html">noticed</a>
that there was some confusion over the licensing of his GnuMICR font package.
He has now clarified in the documentation that the package is released under
the GNU <a href="http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html">General Public
License</a> (GPL).  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0303/msg00085.html">pointed out</a>
that there was some vagueness in the documentation that seemed to suggest
restrictions beyond the GPL.  He thought it best to simply indicate which
files are the 'source' code and which are the 'executable form' of the
fonts.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
