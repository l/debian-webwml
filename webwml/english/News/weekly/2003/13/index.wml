<p>Welcome to this year's 13th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a> made an
interesting <a
href="http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20030401-newsletter.xml">move</a> to
adopt RPM as its package format and abandon its source archive.  This leaves
<a href="http://www.rocklinux.org/">RockLinux</a> as the only distribution that
provides <code>make world</code>.  Additionally, a security flag was <a
href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc3514.txt">added</a> to the IPv4
header in order to distinguish between packets that have malicious intent and
those that are merely unusual.</p>

<p><strong>Martin Michlmayr is the new DPL.</strong> Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00025.html">\
announced</a> that the winner of this year's Debian project leader (DPL) <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2002/vote_0001">election</a> is Martin Michlmayr.  He won
over Bdale Garbee by only four votes.  Congratulations!  The new DPL quickly
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00027.html">\
thanked</a> everyone who voted in this election and noted that the first
three candidates were very close.  He will therefore look at the
other candidates' platforms again in detail and incorporate some of their
ideas into his program.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up Sid on a Laptop.</strong> Jay Docherty has written an <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6742">article</a> for <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a> in which he describes how
to get a laptop up and running with a base installation of the unstable (sid)
version of Debian GNU/Linux.  The article covers how to compile and install a
2.4.20 Linux kernel using <code>apt-get</code> and <code>make-kpkg</code>.
The laptop used was an IBM ThinkPad R32 and users may also find Thomas Hood's
<a href="http://panopticon.csustan.edu/thood/tp600lnx.htm">Debian GNU/Linux on
IBM ThinkPad 600 and 600X</a> page useful.</p>

<p><strong>Independent Count of Votes.</strong> In response to Moshe Zadka's
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00018.html">\
request</a> for an independent count of votes in the Debian Project Leader
Elections, Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01656.html">announced</a>
the appointment of Ryan Murray to produce an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00026.html">\
independent count</a>.  Ryan is well-known and
trusted within the project and has agreed to audit the scripts used to process
raw votes.  He will then run them himself shortly after voting closes on a
copy of the mailbox containing the raw votes to independently determine the
results of the election.  If the two counts result in different winners, Bdale
will refer the matter to the Technical Committee Chairman for resolution.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Helping System.</strong>  Mark Howard <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01503.html">proposed</a>
an advanced bug helping system to coordinate bug fixing efforts.  He thought
that the help tag in the current bug tracking system (BTS) is under-utilized
and that a more advanced system could encourage developers who have the time
and skills to help fix bugs in other packages.  Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01506.html">thought</a>
this could be achieved through the current BTS and Hwei Sheng Teoh <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01507.html">believed</a>
it wouldn't be too different from having dedicated mailing lists and posting
requests when you need help.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Desktop User's Guide.</strong>  John Pisini is actively
working on a <a
href="http://cafecomputer.com/guide/users-guide.en.html">Debian Desktop
User's Guide</a>, which is based upon the <a
href="http://archive.progeny.com/progeny/debian/doc">Progeny Debian User's
Guide</a>.  John's <a
href="http://cafecomputer.com/guide/proposal.html">goal</a> is to bring the
manual up to date for the next release of Debian.  This will include bringing
all Gnome related info in line with the 2.2 version and eventually
incorporating KDE 3.1 to broaden its use.  John would like volunteers to
help with writing material, fixing errors and generating screenshots.</p>

<p><strong>New-Maintainer Process improved.</strong> In the past the Debian
project <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint-0209/msg00024.html">\
received</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint-0209/msg00070.html">many</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint-0210/msg00014.html">complaints</a>
about the tedious procedure for adopting new Debian developers.  After some
months of work on the reorganisation Martin Michlmayr and Andreas Schuldei
proudly <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00027.html">\
announced</a> an improved <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~andreas/newmaint.html">new maintainers'
corner</a>.  From now on the registration, the philosophy &amp; procedures and
tasks &amp; skills tests can be passed online.  Every day a new combination of
questions is generated from a spool of hundreds of questions.  According to
Martin it should now be possible to join the project within three days.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux illegal for Adolescents in Germany?</strong> Today a new
<a href="http://www.usk.de/JuSchG/">law</a> to save young people from
suffering from violent computer games takes <a
href="http://www.ixsoft.de/pr030330-de.html">effect</a> in Germany.  From now
on no games may be sold to underaged, if the games are not explicitly marked
harmless for certain age levels.  Boxed GNU/Linux distributions, however,
often if not always contain games like gcompris or tuxracer that were not
explicitly marked.  Depending on the interpretation of this law, GNU/Linux
boxes may not be sold to young people anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Alioth provides SourceForge for Debian.</strong> Raphaël
Hertzog, Wichert Akkerman, and Roland Mas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00024.html">\
announced</a> the availability of a Debian server running
SourceForge software.  Hosted as <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org/">alioth.debian.org</a>, it
allows collaboration on Debian-related free-software
projects.  Debian developers can use their existing Debian
accounts to access the alioth system.  All developers of Free Software may
use the system, though new projects must have a Debian
developer on their core team.  (Projects without a Debian
affiliation should consider the Free Software
Foundation's <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a> service.)</p>

<p><strong>New Archive Sections.</strong> James Troup <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00028.html">\
announced</a> a change in the Debian archive.  Six new sections have been
added.  The section <code>embedded</code> was added in response to the
recently added <a href="http://opie.handhelds.org/">Opie</a> packages.  The
other new sections were added to help reduce the size of some of the biggest
sections in the archive.  The sections <code>gnome</code> and <code>kde</code>
are designed to help split up the <code>x11</code> section.  The other new
section <code>libdevel</code> is for library development packages and almost
halves the size of <code>devel</code>.  And finally, the sections <code>perl</code> and
<code>python</code> are designed to help split up the
<code>interpreters</code> section.</p>

<p><strong>HTML summary for local Repositories.</strong> Jarno Elonen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01285.html">announced</a> a
<a href="http://elonen.iki.fi/code/parse-apt-files.inc">PHP script</a> to
create an HTML summary page for Packages.gz files that were created for
private archives of Debian packages.  This script produces a nice web-based <a
href="http://elonen.iki.fi/code/unofficial-debs/">frontend</a> to a local
repository.</p>

<p><strong>Scanning orphaned Packages against local System.</strong> Steve
Robbins <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01309.html">\
remembered</a> a nifty <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0103/msg01386.html">script</a> from
Arthur Korn that sends mail when it sees an installed package marked as
orphaned or up for adoption on the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">WNPP</a> list.  Since
the script had <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01309.html">\
stopped</a> working he wondered if somebody had fixed it already.  Jack Moffitt,
however, has released a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01331.html">rewrite</a> in
Python.</p>

<p><strong>Closing Bugs for removed Packages.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01341.html">noticed</a>
that about 300 bugs are still open for packages that were <a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/removals.txt">removed</a> by the release
manager prior to the woody release.  He wondered what the best action for them
would be since you cannot reopen archived bugs.  Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01374.html">mentioned</a>
that adding code for this would be very easy.  Martin also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01346.html">plans</a> to
close bugs that were reported particularly against potato.</p>

<p><strong>Manual Pages and UTF-8.</strong> Vineet Kumar <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01520.html">reported</a>
problems he experienced with several manual pages and the UTF-8 locale
he uses.  When using a UTF-8 locale, those pages use incorrect characters.
Groff converts many of these characters to reasonable characters in ASCII
locales, but some things break in UTF-8 locales.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting the EKG Package.</strong> Marcin Owsiany <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01682.html">reported</a>
about the need to split the EKG package, an instant messaging program.  The
new version can link against both readline and SSL libraries.  However, since
they have conflicting licenses this must not be done in the same package.
Junichi Uekawa <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01698.html">proposed</a>
using the GNU-TLS library instead, however this doesn't <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01700.html">seem</a> to be
possible.  James Troup <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01706.html">suggested</a>
using editline instead of readline, there are even two copies in the
archive.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Wallpaper Package.</strong> Steve Kemp <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0303/msg01687.html">announced</a>
two wallpaper packages for Debian.  They intend to be independent of the used
window manager or desktop environment.  The base <a
href="http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/wallpapers/">package</a> contains a
couple of images and the script needed to do the real work.  The second <a
href="http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/wallpapers/lotr.html">package</a> is a
collection of Tolkien inspired artwork.  There is also a third <a
href="http://www.steve.org.uk/Software/wallpapers/starwars.html">package</a>
which is a collection of images inspired by, and taken from the Star Wars
films.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Accessibility Manual.</strong> Boris Daix <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility-0303/msg00022.html">\
posted</a> the first draft of the Debian GNU/Linux Accessibility Manual, which
contains only the structure of the document.  Currently it only has illustrations for
those with impaired sight, but other stuff will be included as it
comes.  Boris seeks feedback about the structure.</p>

<p><strong>Building a GNU/Linux Mainframe.</strong> Kenneth Geisshirt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-beowulf-0303/msg00048.html">wondered</a>
if it would be possible to build a mainframe-like computer based on Free
Software.  One could use <a href="http://openssi.org/">OpenSSI</a> or <a
href="http://www.openmosix.org/">OpenMosix</a>, <a
href="http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/mpi/mpich/">MPI</a> for process management
and <a href="http://www.plex86.org/">Plex86</a> or <a
href="http://bochs.sf.net/">Bochs</a> to create virtual server.
Useful information for a such project is already <a
href="http://www.linuxvirtualserver.org/links.html">collected</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Installation for blind People.</strong> Mario Lang has
been playing with the debian-installer since November and recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility-0303/msg00026.html">\
managed</a> to do a complete installation with the brltty enabled
debian-installer <a href="http://people.debian.org/~mlang/net-brl-1440.img">\
disk</a>.  However the driver still has to be added to the command line.</p>

<p><strong>Handling of multiple Library Versions.</strong> Stephen Frost <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0303/msg00000.html">contacted</a>
the technical committee in order to find an answer to the following problem and to
document it in the
policy.  He seeks a decision on how to properly handle multiple library
versions which end up linked into the same process.  Versioned symbols would
potentially break compatibility with other distributions and the LSB, while
conflicting library packages would render several packages uninstallable.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Port Status.</strong> Alastair McKinstry is
working on a <a href="http://people.debian.org/~mckinstry/ports-status.html">\
status page</a> to track the builds of debian-installer on various
architectures.  He believes that we need to get builds happening on all ports
soon if debian-installer is to be released this year.  Volunteers on non-x86
platforms are wanted.  Sebastian Ley has also done some good <a
href="http://www.mmweg.rwth-aachen.de/~sebastian.ley/d-i/">work</a> on the
graphical installer.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
