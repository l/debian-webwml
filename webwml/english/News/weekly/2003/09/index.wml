<p>Welcome to this year's 9th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Today's issue is a little bit short, so the next one will
probably be a little bit longer.  Marek Habersack <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0302/msg00048.html">informed</a>
us about an <a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/?article=7598">article</a>
about Linux security - a continuing joke.  It made us laugh.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2.2 for Debian Woody.</strong> Jamie Strandboge <a
href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8212380009.html">announced</a> on
DesktopLinux.com that he has backported GNOME packages from Debian unstable,
to run on Debian stable.  The list of packages also
include Gnucash, Mozilla, Galeon and Evolution.  To use the packages you only
need to add a line to your sources.list file.</p>

<p><strong>New Mailing Lists created.</strong> Anand Kumria <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0302/msg00014.html">\
announced</a> several new lists to support work for non-english languages.
Additionally the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/deity/">deity</a> list has been
opened to the public and a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~mlang/DebianAccessibilityProject.html">\
debian-accessibility</a> list has been created.  Earlier he <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0302/msg00000.html">\
announced</a> that he had installed razor and crossassassin to reduce the number
of spam mails distributed through the Debian lists.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Support for RISC Architectures.</strong> Andrew Buckeridge
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0301/msg00052.html">pointed
out</a> that HP, SGI, Sun and IBM are supporting their own architecture
together with their own proprietary operating system.  All four, however, also
push the x86 architecture together with GNU/Linux.  He asks anybody interested
in these ports to contact their hardware vendors to clarify support for
GNU/Linux, since Debian <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">supports</a> all on them.</p>

<p><strong>New Maintainer Reports.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0302/msg00076.html">recently</a>
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0302/msg00077.html">\
announced</a> 18 new maintainers that were accepted by the Debian project.  He
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0302/msg00015.html">\
says</a> that since Debian is growing so much, it's good to have a <a
href="http://nm.debian.org/~tbm/nm-report.html">listing</a> of new members
together with a little background of them.</p>

<p><strong>Out of sync Packages in Testing?</strong> Jérôme Marant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01770.html">proposed</a> to
let a package enter the testing distribution when they compile on some
architectures without the need to compile on all.  He believes that a package
should enter testing as soon as possible so it can be tested by interested
users.  Anthony Towns <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01880.html">said</a> that
this would be problematic since there is only one source package per suite.
Colin Watson finally <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01863.html">wondered</a>
why so many people are more concerned with juggling infrastructure details
instead of fixing the bugs.</p>

<p><strong>More Release Proposals.</strong> Jaldhar Vyas <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01801.html">proposed</a> an
update for woody with several backported packages, a central source repository
and the permission for all maintainers to fix bugs, and to stop releasing at
all since this could be done by third parties.  Jesus Climent <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0302/msg01849.html">added</a> that
HispaLinux started to create personalised Debian releases targeted at concrete
groups of users (such as universities, education facilities, government
etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Ceasing unmaintained Documentation.</strong> Adam Di Carlo <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0302/msg00067.html">proposed</a>
removing manuals which are obsoleted or unmaintained.  He would like to clean up
some unmaintained documents and focus our efforts in a single place.  He asked
for opinions about merging the tutorial, user manual, Debian guide, system
administrator guide and the network administrator guide with the well
maintained Debian <a href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/reference/">\
reference</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian used for Security Appliance.</strong> LinuxDevices <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS3541709526.html">reports</a> that <a
href="http://www.innominate.com/">Innominate Security Technologies</a> will
unveil what it calls the "world's smallest security appliance" at the Intel
Developer Forum.  Debian GNU/Linux is the first choice as base operating
system for Innominate when developing standard and customized security
appliances for a long time.  Current products are based on version 2.2 and 3.0.
While using Open Source code for product development, Innominate are of course also
anxious to <a href="http://innominate.org/">contribute</a> their own code.</p>

<p><strong>Report from Hamburger Computer Tage.</strong> Jan Palic finished
his <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0123-hct-report">report</a> about the Debian
presence at Hamburger Computer Tage at the end of January.  Debian was invited
to staff a booth and give two talks in addition to many other talks covering
GNU/Linux.  The Debian booth was subject of interest by many visitors during
the entire exhibition.</p>

<p><strong>Report from FOSDEM.</strong> Christoph Siess sent in his <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0208-fosdem-report">report</a> about the Debian
presence at the Free and Open Source Software Developers' Meeting (FOSDEM).
The Debian project maintained a booth that attracted a lot of developers.
Martin Michlmayr gave a talk about Embedded Debian and Russell Coker spoke
about SE Linux which attracted quite some visitors.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-254">traceroute-nanog</a> --
