<p>Welcome to this year's 51st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Finally, the Debian website is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0312/msg00161.html">functional</a>
again, but not all mirrors are updating yet.  The <a
href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">FSF Europe</a> is <a
href="http://mail.fsfeurope.org/pipermail/press-release-de/2003q4/000021.html">\
seeking</a> <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/help/donate">donations</a> to
secure their work in the future.  Some political factions make clear
statements with regards to the use of Free Software.  So did the new
Queensland Greens party and <a
href="http://qld.greens.org.au/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=78">\
announced</a> that their website is running Free Software on top of the Debian
operating system.  Merry Christmas to all of you who celebrate the birth of Jesus.</p>

<p><strong>Mass pbuilder Installation Testing.</strong> Junichi Uekawa <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01744.html">reported</a>
about his efforts to test the installation of packages in a pbuilder
environment.  About 300 packages failed to install, 20 of them were kernel
packages and about 50 were Emacs 20 packages since Emacs doesn't install when
<code>stdin</code> is directed to <code>/dev/null</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Translation Howto.</strong> Christian Perrier <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0312/msg01066.html">presented</a>
the <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/translations.txt">\
debian-installer translation micro-HOWTO</a>.  People, who offer help with
translating <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>
should read it first.  It suggests a list of priorities so that commonly used phrases
are translated first.  Christian also sent in a translation <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0312/msg01037.html">status report</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Source moved to Alioth.</strong>
Joey Hess
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0312/msg00748.html">announced</a>
that he has moved <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/d-i/">source code</a>
for the new
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>
into <a href="https://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth's</a> CVS
repository.  This should make it easier for translators and
developers without accounts on the main Debian systems to
contribute.</p>

<p><strong>Support Free Software by purchasing Books.</strong> Thorsten Ehlers
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0312/msg00062.html">\
told</a> us about the <a href="http://www.bookzilla.de/">Bookzilla</a>
project which sells books online for a German distributor.  The entire
commission which is 5&nbsp;% of the price is donated to the <a
href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>.  The FSF
Europe was <a href="http://www.bookzilla.de/shop/action/magazine?mpid=2187">\
chosen</a> as it works on general and political issues from which all Free
Software projects benefit.  He added that if you are planning to buy some books, CDs or
DVDs, you may want to consider doing this at Bookzilla to support Free
Software.</p>

<p><strong>Two Years debianforum.de.</strong> The German speaking web forum <a
href="http://debianforum.de/">debianforum.de</a> for
Debian Users celebrated its second anniversary. With discussions starting like "How
to install a program" debianforum.de has turned into an important site
for both the Debian beginners and the professional users in German speaking
countries. The forum is also awaiting its 100,000th posting soon.</p>

<p><strong>Extracting SSH Keys from LDAP.</strong> Matt Zimmerman was
interested in a way to extract SSH keys from Debian's <a
href="https://db.debian.org/">LDAP database</a> to ensure that the client
connects to the proper machine.  He sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01192.html">Python</a>
program to accomplish this.  Clint Adams added the same in <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01373.html">Z Shell</a> and
Andrew Suffield finally provided the same functionality in <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01443.html">Perl</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Linux Kernel Packages.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01460.html">put</a> his
alternative packages of the Linux kernel in an APT <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~rmh/debian/">repository</a> on gluck, so that
interested people can use it until the ftp-masters enable the overrides.  He
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0311/msg00204.html">believed</a>
that Debian doesn't provide a solution for newbie users to "install &amp;
forget" for kernel packages just like for all other packages, so he tried to
accomplish this.</p>

<p><strong>Support for the Lustre Cluster Filesystem?</strong> Nick Pavlica <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01543.html">wondered</a> if
Debian was interested in adding support for the <a
href="http://www.lustre.org/">Lustre Cluster Filesystem</a>.  Jörg Wendland <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01561.html">thought</a>
that this is something to include in the new Enterprise Subproject and Andres
Salomon even <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01572.html">planned</a>
to package the required tools and patches.</p>

<p><strong>Defining Build Dependencies.</strong> Roland Stigge <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01743.html">noticed</a>
that several packages (about 1871) declare an architecture independent build
dependency against <code>debhelper</code> but use parts of it in the
<code>clean</code> target.  Andreas Metzler <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0312/msg01804.html">countered</a>
that such <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/216747">bugs</a> will be found as
soon as the package is processed by a build daemon.  This is fine for
architecture independent packages (<code>binary-all</code>), though.</p>

<p><strong>Report from Linux World Expo Frankfurt.</strong> Alexander Schmehl
wrote a <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1027-lwe-report">report</a> about the
Debian presence at this year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1027-lwe">Linux
World Expo</a> in Frankfurt.  Debian, KDE and PostgreSQL joined booths so it
looked larger and more inviting.  An interested visitor wondered if there was
a company supporting about 10,000 installations of Debian and another one was
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0312/msg00072.html">unhappy</a>
with the state of Java in the stable release and hence offered money to help
fix it.</p>

<p><strong>HP expanding Debian Support.</strong> John Ribeiro <a
href="http://www.techworld.com/news/index.cfm?fuseaction=displaynews&amp;NewsID=739">\
reported</a> that Bdale Garbee (HP's Linux chief technology officer and
Debian developer) announced HP's plans to expand support for Debian GNU/Linux
at the recent <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1202-bangalore">Linux
Bangalore</a> conference in India.  HP has sponsored Debian in various ways
over the years but has lacked Debian support offerings.  Michael Schulz from
HP Germany later <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0312/msg00067.html">\
confirmed</a> this.</p>

<p><strong>Want to continue reading DWN?</strong> Please help us create this
newsletter.  We still need more volunteer writers who watch the Debian
community and report about what is going on.  Please see the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/contributing">contributing page</a> to find out how
to help.  We're looking forward to receiving your mail at <a
