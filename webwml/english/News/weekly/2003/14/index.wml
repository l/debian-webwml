<p>Welcome to this year's 14th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Since the last issue was released on April 1st, some of you
should've been more careful with its content.  We knew very well that Gentoo's
move to RPM and the additional IPv4 header were just pranks.  However, we
didn't want to leave you witout our own April fools <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~andreas/newmaint.html">prank</a>, courtesy of
Thomas Bliesener and Andreas Schuldei.  However, the new <a
href="http://www.usk.de/JuSchG/">law</a> in Germany was real.</p>

<p><strong>SPI Resolutions about Donations.</strong> Bdale Garbe <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0304/msg00000.html">\
reported</a> about the most recent board meeting of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest, Inc.</a>
(SPI).  Donations prior to January 2002 for which not enough documentation
exist anymore are <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000049.html">\
considered</a> to be earmarked for Debian by 95&nbsp;%.  Donations made later
will be <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2003/000050.html">\
credited</a> entirely to the projects for which they were earmarked.</p>

<p><strong>Acquiring Government Support.</strong> In an article on <a
href="http://newsforge.com/">NewsForge</a> Alex Perry talks about his <a
href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/03/03/25/1539222.shtml">ideas</a> about
how Free Software developers can get more U.S. government contracts.  His idea
is to create very specialized CDs containing a base installation, an office suite
and a full distribution, which would be sold at rather high prices but
including support and training.  This would compete better with proprietary
vendors' offerings and would support Free Software projects if the contractor
would be SPI for example.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Debian Woody.</strong> Jonathan Oxer contributed an <a
href="http://www.linmagau.org/modules.php?name=Sections&amp;op=viewarticle&amp;artid=46">\
article</a> to <a href="http://www.linmagau.org/">linmagau</a> entitled "The
Debian Universe".  He agrees that the current installation program from Debian
is ugly but also notes that some people believe that a not so easy installer
will keep horde of unwashed masses away from Debian who aren't worthy of such
a fine OS!  In the article Jonathan describes in detail how the installer
works and how packages are installed.</p>

<p><strong>Policy compliant init Scripts.</strong> Bill Allombert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00079.html">noticed</a>
that a lot of init.d scripts <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00100.html">fail</a> to
implement policy properly.  Bill wants all init.d script to behave the same
and supposed to standardise on the <a
href="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.3.0/gLSB/gLSB/iniscrptact.html">\
LSB 1.3</a> which has an extended description of init.d scripts behaviour.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Usability Research.</strong> After the entusiasm gathered at
the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0120-linuxconf">Linux Conference
Australia</a>, Enrico Zini <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00127.html">announced</a>
the birth of a new <a href="http://deb-usability.alioth.debian.org">Debian
effort</a>.  The Debian Usability Research is a volunteer research effort
focused on identifying and addressing Debian-specific usability issues, not
necessarily tied to the desktop.</p>

<p><strong>First Metadistros Coordination Meeting.</strong> Teófilo Ruiz Suárez
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00134.html">\
announced</a> the first project coordination meeting for <a
href="http://metadistros.hispalinux.es/">Metadistros</a>, which tries to
simplify the process of building customized Debian based distributions (<a
href="http://metadistros.hispalinux.es/whitepaper.pdf">whitepaper</a>), for
example live CDs.  Hispalinux organises this meeting on April 14th and 15th at
the Universidad Autónoma of Madrid, Spain.</p>

<p><strong>Revised LaTeX Project Public License.</strong> Jeff Licquia <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0304/msg00006.html">posted</a> a
new working draft for the LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).  After the
debate that took place months ago, Jeff and several members of the LaTeX
Project worked off and on towards solving the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00250.html">problems</a>
that had been raised before.  This version, a near-total rewrite, is the
result.</p>

<p><strong>Security Administration with Debian GNU/Linux.</strong>  Jose
Salvador Gonzalez Rivera wrote a <a
href="http://www.linuxgazette.com/issue89/gonzales.html">paper</a> on
security administration with Debian GNU/Linux.  Jose concentrates on
specific issues and situations not considered frequently, such as the use of
limits and files attributes.  He hopes that the article can help people get a
little bit more interest in GNU/Linux security, and specifically with Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Apt-get for Users.</strong>  Thomas Petazzoni <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00348.html">wondered</a>
if it would be possible to enable normal users to install software in their
home directories with <code>apt-get</code> on systems where only the
administrator has root access.  Chad Walstrom <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00385.html">pointed
out</a> several problems with the idea, including binaries with hardcoded
paths.  Emile van Bergen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00391.html">thought</a>
these could be overcome, although Corrin Lakeland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00395.html">suggested</a>
that it might only be achieved by using <code>apt-src</code> instead of
<code>apt-get</code> because so many packages need to be configured at
compile time.</p>

<p><strong>Installing WINE.</strong> The issue of <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=phpBB_14&amp;file=index&amp;action=viewtopic&amp;topic=1179">\
installing</a> <code>wine</code> was raised this week in the <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">DebianHelp</a> forums.  A user discoverd
that <code>apt-get install wine winesetuptk</code> gave him an installation
without the necessary <code>wine.conf</code> file and his attempts to run
<code>winesetup</code> were unsuccessful.  The problem stemmed from trying to
run <code>winesetup</code> as root.  After installing <code>wine</code>,
<code>winesetup</code> should be run in normal user mode.</p>

<p><strong>Debconf Template Translation Management.</strong> Andre Luis Lopes
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00366.html">\
planned</a> to provide patches for packages that aren't using po-debconf for
managing debconf template translations yet.  This, however, requires a build
dependency against po-debconf.  He wonders if a stronger dependency against
debconf would be sufficient.  Andre Luis also has the impression that changing
packages to use po-debconf will actually make things worse for backporters who
are trying to make packages build correctly on woody.</p>

<p><strong>Familiar Packages for Debian?</strong> Russell Coker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg00398.html">pondered</a>
packaging the <a href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/">Familiar
distribution</a> of Linux for Debian.  It consists of a
boot loader (non-linux binary), an image of the root file system (JFFS2 file
system image) which is about 13M, a kernel patch for 2.4.19, gcc and binutils
for cross-compiling ARM code on an i386 platform and finally a complete tool
chain.  This is a total of about 130&nbsp;MB.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure

<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-275">lpr-ppd</a> --
