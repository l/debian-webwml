# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 44th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Bruce Perens <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02212.html">reserved</a>
nonfree.org as a possible home for non-free if it ever spins off of Debian.
Currently it's just a CNAME to ftp.debian.org but with a little work it could
be a good facility to manage a non-free cut-over.</p>

<p><strong>Debian faster than Gentoo?</strong> Matt Garman
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.user/50924">wondered</a>
why his C++ program ran dramatically slower when compiled on
a Gentoo machine than when compiled with Debian Sid.  He later
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.user/50973">reported</a>
that recompiling the Gentoo C++ libraries with less
aggressive optimization flags (<code>-O2</code> instead of <code>-O3</code>) eliminated
the speed difference.  William Kenworthy <a
href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.user/50953">added</a> that
Debian and other distributions are conservative, but set up by very
experienced people.</p>

<p><strong>System Recovery with Knoppix.</strong> IBM Developerworks has an <a
href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-knopx.html">\
article</a> by Carla Schroder that describes how to rescue a non-booting Linux
system, edit files, mount networked filesystems, and do a bare-metal rebuild
with only a <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> disk and an
Internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>Improving KDE Maintainership.</strong>
Some people may have been alarmed to see that many of the core KDE
packages were orphaned last week by Chris Cheney. Fortunately, this was
done to pave the way for the Qt/KDE Maintainers group of which Chris Cheney is
a member. A <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qt-kde/">mailing list</a>
for this group was created and a draft <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~madkiss/debian-kde-policy.html">policy
document</a> is being discussed.</p>

<p><strong>Amendment of the Social Contract.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00106.html">proposed</a> to
amend the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>.  Some of his
<a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~dark/draft-sc-amendment-20031030.html">\
amendments</a> change the meaning of the Social Contract, whereas others are
only editorial. One of his key proposals is that Debian's commitment to a
non-free archive be deleted.  This means that Debian would be free to stop
providing non-free software if it chose.  The proposal was <a
href="http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/03/10/30/1618243.shtml?tid=185&amp;tid=90">\
discussed</a> on Slashdot, where Bruce Perens <a
href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=84151&amp;cid=7352420">\
suggested</a> <a
href="http://developers.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=84151&amp;cid=7352723">\
how</a> removing non-free might work.  The proposal would also make the Social
Contract a bit separate from the Debian Free Software Guidelines.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in the Enterprise?</strong> James Maguire <a
href="http://www.newsfactor.com/perl/story/22602.html">wondered</a> if there
is a place for Debian in the enterprise world.  He talks about certification
or rather the lack of and missing vendor support which is compensated by third
party support from different companies.  Use of Debian depends on the
requirements of the end user.  If they were technically self supporting, and
they don't want to pay a different vendor, they could deploy Debian -- and it
would lead to greater return on investment.</p>

<p><strong>Draft Position Statement regarding GNU FDL.</strong> Manoj
Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0310/msg00178.html">\
reported</a> about the effort writing a document that attempts to address some
concerns that members of the Debian project have about the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">Free Documentation License</a>
(FDL). This <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement.html">\
document</a> attempts to present the reasoning behind the conclusion that the
GNU FDL is not regarded as a license that can easily satisfy the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Constitutional Amendment Results.</strong>  Proposal A in the <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/vote_0003">vote</a> to disambiguate <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">Constitution</a> section 4.1.5 <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0310/msg00114.html">succeeded</a>
over the other options.  This means that the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Debian Social Contract</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> are now "Foundation Documents", and may be modified by a
3:1 majority of Developers.  The amendment also clarified the status of
non-technical documents, ensuring that Developers may issue, supersede and
withdraw various statements, including position statements about issues of
the day.</p>

<p><strong>Debconf Templates Style Guide.</strong>  Christian Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0310/msg01686.html">announced</a> a
style guide for writing debconf templates.
During his work translating debconf templates to French, Christian often
found templates which seemed to be inconsistent with some written or
unwritten rules.  It became evident that some formalisation of writing rules
and recommendations could help package maintainers to prepare "well-written"
debconf templates.  General style harmonisation could also greatly improve
the perception of Debian, giving it a more "professional" presentation.</p>

<p><strong>NetBSD Status Report.</strong>  Joel Baker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0310/msg00009.html">posted</a>
a NetBSD status report.  Joel will be restarting the archive using <code>debpool</code>
(which should handle uploads via HTTPS PUT, without needing logins on the box
itself).  The archive will be based on -current again (aka, pre-2.0), since
he has run into problems which can only be resolved by having working POSIX
Thread support.  He is also continuing to work on the 4-to-3-clause BSD
license conversion, with the permission of the NetBSD Foundation (contacting
authors and asking them to relicense, submitting patches, and working with
the Core team to get them integrated cleanly).  So far, this has been
dramatically successful.</p>

<p><strong>Getting HP Hardware supported for Debian.</strong> Kianusch Sayah
Karadji is <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0310/msg06517.html">\
trying</a> to convince <a href="http://www.hp.com/">HP</a> to add Debian
support to their hardware.  HP claims, that since Debian has no figures on how
many users it has on HP servers, they do not know if supporting Debian would
make sense.  If you do, please get in touch with Kianusch at
<a href="mailto:debian@sk-tech.net">debian@sk-tech.net</a>.  Several HP employees <a
href="http://www.opensource.hp.com/opensource_projects.html">are</a> members
of the Debian development community.</p>

<p><strong>Tasksel and custom Debian Distributions.</strong> Andreas Tille <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02048.html">wondered</a>
how tasksel is supposed to support custom Debian distributions such as <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Jr.</a> or <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a>.  Currently tasksel displays
the <code>debian-jr</code> task but ignores the others.  Of course, a more
sophisticated solution should be found to handle them equally.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple PostgreSQL Packages.</strong> Oliver Elphick <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02058.html">pondered</a>
whether and how to have multiple versions of the PostgreSQL packages <a
href="http://cvs.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/common/postgresql-client.html?cvsroot=pkg-postgresql">\
installed</a> at once.  This is to get round problems with upgrading major
versions, and to allow people to have multiple database clusters, possibly at
different software versions.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project at COMDEX.</strong> There'll be a Debian <a
href="http://www.comdex.com/lasvegas2003/exhib/index.php?s=ic_open_spkr">installation
festival</a>
at this year's <a href="http://www.comdex.com/lasvegas2003/">Comdex</a> in Las
Vegas on Thursday, November 20th, from 12:00pm to 1:30pm.  Everybody is
welcome to help or be helped.  Also at Comdex, in the "Open Source and Linux
Innovation Center", on Tuesday 18th from 1:30pm to 2:00pm a half hour talk
introduces Debian to corporate users and, in the Open Source conference track,
on Wednesday 19th from 3:30pm to 4:45pm a <a
href="http://education.key3media.com:8080/comdex/lv2003/education/FMPro?-DB=K3Sessions.fp5&amp;-lay=webform&amp;-format=session_detail.html&amp;Session_ID=3733&amp;-Find">\
discussion panel</a> titled "A Practical Guide to Open Source Operating
Systems" will include Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Alternative Postscript- and PDF-Viewer.</strong> Matthias Urlichs
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02091.html">noticed</a>
that there are virtual packages for postscript-viewer and pdf-viewer, but no
alternatives, i.e. there's no <code>/usr/bin/postscript-viewer</code>.  Mark
Brown <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02109.html">\
explained</a> that Debian uses a MIME handler registration system which viewer
programs should be making use of.  The <code>run-mailcap</code> program can
be used to find an appropriate program for a given MIME type.</p>

<p><strong>Localised Bug Reports.</strong> Magosányi Arpád <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02141.html">wondered</a> if
there is a known or planned way to report bugs to the Debian Bug Tracking
System in a non-english language.  He proposed that if a non-english language
is detected, the bug report is sent to a language package instead the real
package.  The maintainers of the language package would then mediate the
communication between the user and the package maintainer.</p>

<p><strong>Request for a Debian Kernels List.</strong> Francesco Paolo
Lovergine <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02173.html">\
proposed</a> to create a new mailing list debian-kernels in order to ease the
coordination and maintenance of kernels and patches in Debian.  This list
would not be limited to Linux kernels but also include Hurd and *BSD.  He also
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/218923">requested</a> the list to be
created.</p>

<p><strong>Circular Build Dependencies.</strong> Anthony DeRobertis <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg02223.html">wondered</a> if
he is the only one who believed that one could build Debian from source,
starting with only essential and build-essential packages.  In particular he
stomped over the cdbs - libgd-gd2-*-perl - cdbs chain.  Joel Baker would <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0311/msg00012.html">like</a> to see
Debian main in stable and testing as closed sets in terms of
build-dependencies.  The current situation is a pain for porters to a new
architecture or kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Split Kernel Header Files.</strong> Otto Wyss <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0311/msg00033.html">wondered</a>
why <a href="http://packages.debian.org/libc6-dev">libc6-dev</a> suddenly
depended on <a href="http://packages.debian.org/linux-kernel-headers">\
linux-kernel-headers</a>.  Mark Brown <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0311/msg00037.html">explained</a>
that there have always been some kernel headers included in libc6-dev. They
have just been split out into a separate package now.  Several of these
headers are referenced by headers provided by glibc which would break those
headers if linux-kernel-headers is not installed.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-396">thttpd</a> --
