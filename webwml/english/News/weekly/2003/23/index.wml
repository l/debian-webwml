# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 23rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  There is a nice little <a
href="http://bbspot.com/News/2003/01/os_quiz.php">quiz</a> up at BBspot which
correlates your personality with an operating system.  Amazingly enough,
Debian is one of the possible outcomes.  Find out if you are a true Debian
user!</p>

<p><strong>Debian X Strike Force Subversion Repository.</strong> Branden
Robinson <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0306/msg00039.html">\
announced</a> that Debian's XFree86 packages are becoming team-maintained.  In
practice they have always been to some extent, thanks to contributions large
and small from many people.  As another improvement Branden has established a
Subversion <a href="http://necrotic.deadbeast.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/">\
repository</a>.  With the Debian XFree86 packages under version control, he
expects the quality and pace of the work to increase.</p>

<p><strong>Freedesktop Menu System.</strong> Chris Cheney <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg02035.html">asked</a> what
was going to happen to plans for the Debian menu system to migrate to the <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/menu/draft/menu-spec/menu-spec.html">\
desktop menu specification</a> from freedesktop.org.  Bill Allombert, the menu
system maintainer, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg02051.html">replied</a>
that he wasn't sure what the Debian menu system needed to do.  Colin Walters
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg02071.html">\
explained</a> that the Free Software world seems to have settled on the
.desktop format as the standard for menus.  The whole idea was to supplant the
myriad of incompatible menu systems used by various distributors.</p>

<p><strong>Status of Sarge Release Issues.</strong> Drew Scott Daniels <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00112.html">posted</a>
another updated list of sarge release issues. This is a list of things to be
done before sarge can be released, with status information and an estimated
priority (of 1-3). Debian-Installer <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/TODO?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">\
work</a> and <a href="https://people.debian.org/~mckinstry/ports-status.html">\
porting</a> remain high on the list and the <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~rmurray/c++transition.html">transition to GCC
3.3</a> needs attention.  Other issues include <a
href="https://release.debian.org/britney/testing_probs.html">problems in
testing</a>, the Linux kernel needs to be <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01334.html">handled
differently</a>, the <a href="https://people.debian.org/~branden/xsf/">X Strike
Force</a> could use some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0305/msg00134.html">help</a> getting
4.3.0 ready, <a href="https://people.debian.org/~walters/gnome2.html">\
GNOME&nbsp;2</a> should be in testing soon and libpng is in <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0304/msg01880.html">transition</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Version Control for Packages File.</strong> Glenn McGrath <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00128.html">suggested</a>
putting the <code>Packages</code> file under some sort of version control in
order to minimise bandwidth requirements.  Most people <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00236.html">agreed</a> that
this would be a positive move.  Anthony Towns <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00209.html">pointed out</a>
that <a href="https://people.debian.org/~bjb/"><code>apt-pupdate</code></a> can
do this, and Nicolas Kratz <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00176.html">suggested</a>
trying <a href="http://home.tiscali.cz:8080/~cz210552/aptrsync.html"><code>\
apt-rsync</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problems Linking to OpenSSL.</strong> As has been <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2002/debian-legal-200210/msg00113.html">\
discussed</a> at length, the OpenSSL license is incompatible with the GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a> (GPL).  This
week, MySQL developers planned to <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00061.html">allow</a> MySQL
to link with OpenSSL by offering a blanket exception covering combined work
licensed under one or more OSI approved licenses.  The developer of the
gaim-encryption plugin found himself in a similar position, but plans to <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00107.html">rewrite</a> his
code to cease dependence on OpenSSL.</p>

<p><strong>ACPI Howto.</strong>  Emma Jane Hogbin <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0306/msg00985.html">announced</a>
the second draft of her <a
href="http://xtrinsic.com/geek/articles/acpi.phtml">Advanced Configuration
and Power Interface Howto</a>.  ACPI allows control of power management from
within the operating system.  The document summarises the process of installing
and using ACPI on a Debian laptop with a patched 2.4.20 Linux kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Debian's 10th Birthday.</strong> The word is out as Alexander
Neumann <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00058.html">\
noticed</a> and Debian will turn 10 this August.  Anniversary parties are
planned on several places on this planet.  Details are not yet available and
there will probably be more parties organized, but preparations for events in
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00061.html">\
Japan</a>, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00066.html">\
Australia</a>, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00075.html">Germany</a>, <a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/debian-uk/2003-June/001487.html">\
Great Britain</a> and the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00202.html">US</a> were
already started.</p>

<p><strong>Recommendations for Knoppix DVD.</strong> Klaus Knopper <a
href="http://mailman.linuxtag.org/pipermail/debian-knoppix/2003-June/003062.html">\
announced</a> that he is currently working on a DVD edition of Knoppix for <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2003/en/index.html">LinuxTag 2003</a>.  He would
like to know which software people would like to see on a full featured
edition, which will probably contain Fabian Franz' new Knoppix installer as
well.  Additional software packages need to be free, stable and available in
binary and source form.</p>

<p><strong>Call For Votes: Voting Method GR.</strong>  The Debian Project
Secretary has <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0306/msg00004.html">posted</a>
a call for votes in a Voting Method General Resolution (GR).  Developers are
asked to vote on a General Resolution to <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/vote_0002">amend the constitution</a>
to update the Voting Mechanism.  Votes may either be cast in favour of the
Clone Proof SSD Condorcet Amendment, or in favour of further discussion.
Votes must be received by 23:59:59, Friday, June 20th, 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/FreeBSD Self-Hosting.</strong>  Robert Millan <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0306/msg00002.html">announced</a>
that he has managed to get <a href="https://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/">\
GNU/FreeBSD</a> installed self-hosting.  The kernel
runs init, which initialises swap and filesystems, and spawns 8 nice gettys.
He has built a new base <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/pub/">tarball</a> (26.9&nbsp;MB), with
only the minimal utilities plus APT.  He has also <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0306/msg00004.html">set
up</a> an APT repository for his GNU/FreeBSD packages, including the
<code>toolchain</code> and XFree86.</p>

<p><strong>Accessing CVS with Kerberos.</strong> Jennifer Vesperman, author of
the book <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/cvs/index.html?CMP=IL7015">\
Essential CVS</a>, wrote an <a
href="http://linux.oreillynet.com/pub/a/linux/2003/05/22/cvs_gssapi.html">\
article</a> about using CVS with Kerberos 5 and <a
href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/kerberos-faq/general/section-84.html">GSSAPI</a>
(Generic Security Services API) on an unstable Debian system.  The document
explains how to compile <a href="http://www.cvshome.org/">cvs</a> to use GSSAPI and demonstrates its use.
Jennifer also explained several problems that are likely to occur and how to
fix them.</p>

<p><strong>Running Debian on an Acer Tablet PC.</strong> Dean Townsley managed
to install Debian GNU/Linux on the <a
href="http://global.acer.com/products/tablet_pc/tmc100.htm">Acer Travelmate
C100</a> which is a tablet PC that can also act as normal notebook.  Anyone
who has setup a few systems and compiled their own kernel before should be
able to install and set up Debian on such a machine.  He <a
href="http://prometheus.physics.ucsb.edu/~dean/TmC100/AcerTmC100.html">\
described</a> in detail how the system is booted from the network and how X
needs to be configured in order to support the pen.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on a Rocket.</strong> Andrew Greenberg and Brian O'Neel from
the Portland State Aerospace Society <a
href="http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,59144,00.html">built</a> a 12
pound rocket which shall launch this September and will travel at three times
the speed of sound to 55,000 feet.  The <a
href="http://www.usenix.org/events/usenix03/activities.html#rocket">team</a>
builds <a href="http://twiki.psas.pdx.edu/bin/view/PSAS/Projects">suborbital
rockets</a> that are smaller than commercial rockets, but larger and more
powerful than hobby ones.  In addition, the project relies on <a
href="http://twiki.psas.pdx.edu/bin/view/PSAS/Usenix2003Paper">Free
Software</a>, such as Debian, and hardware, which can dramatically improve the
performance of the rockets.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging large I18n Files.</strong> Ben Burton would like to <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0306/msg00445.html">package</a>
internationalisation (i18n) files for <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/koffice">koffice</a>, but unfortunately this
would add another 21&nbsp;MB to the archive.  He came up with three scenarios
which all have drawbacks.  Adding 37 different packages, one for each
language, or adding one large package containing all languages, or adding these
language files to the kde-i18n-lang packages.  All three don't seem
favourable.</p>

<p><strong>Open Software License.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00025.html">dug out</a> a
new license which is used by elfutils, which is included in RPM 4.2.  However,
Walter Landry <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00043.html">pointed out</a>
that this license is not compatible with the GNU GPL.  Branden Robinson even <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0306/msg00050.html">considered</a>
the license to be not compliant with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Status of UTF-8 Debian Changelogs.</strong> Jérôme Marant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0306/msg00021.html">asked</a>
about the status of using UTF-8 in Debian changelog files, since he's seen
some UTF-8-encoded debian/changelog files.  However, he hasn't seen anything
yet mentioning it is allowed in Debian Policy.  Josip Rodin <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0306/msg00025.html">explained</a>
that the Debian policy does not need to precede the implementation.</p>

<p><strong>DebConf Registration ends.</strong> Andreas Schuldei <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0306/msg00005.html">\
announced</a> that due to logistical and organisational reasons they have to
close the registration for DebConf&nbsp;3 and DebCamp on June 16th.
Accommodation in Oslo is available for free, in a gym hall in close proximity
to the camp and conference location.  People who would like to participate but
weren't able to register in time are welcome as well, but they can't expect
the same care from the organisers as the early birds.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
