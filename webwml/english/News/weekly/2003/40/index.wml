<p>Welcome to this year's 40th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  DivisionTwo.com wrote an amusing <a
href="http://www.divisiontwo.com/articles/barbieOS.htm">article</a> about a
fictitious Barbie OS based on Debian.  LinuxIT <a
href="http://www.linuxit.com/Press/Press030903.html">announced</a> it would
release its Linux Professional Institute Certification <a
href="http://www.linuxit.com/lpi.html">training manuals</a> under a free
license.</p>

<p><strong>emDebian at UK Linux Expo.</strong>  LinuxDevices.com <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS4146203121.html">reports</a> that
Debian's Vincent Sanders will attend the upcoming <a
href="http://www.linuxexpouk.co.uk/Exhibition/Visiting/">Linux Expo UK</a> to
discuss ideas about emDebian at Debian's stand in the <a
href="http://www.linuxexpo.org.uk/">.Org Village</a>.  <a
href="http://www.emdebian.org/">emDebian's</a> aims are to improve Debian as
a whole for embedded use and to provide a set of tools to generate embedded
device images simply and quickly.  LinuxDevices.com's annual <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT7301151332.html">Embedded Linux
Market Survey</a> showed Debian to be the third most popular GNU/Linux
distribution for embedded development.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project at European Conferences.</strong> The Debian project
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2003/20031005">announced</a> that its members and
affiliates will attend four exhibitions and conferences that cover Free
Software and GNU/Linux in Europe.  On October 7th and 8th <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1007-opensaar">Opensaar</a> takes place in
Saarbrücken, Germany, with a talk about mail services with Debian by Marko
Jung.  On October 8th and 9th <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1008-linuxexpo">\
Linux Expo UK</a> will take place in Olympia, London, U.K.  This is followed
by <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1011-plgiessen">Practical Linux</a> in Gießen
Germany on October 11th, where Alexander Schmehl will give a talk and a
workshop about Debian.  Finally from October 14th to 16th <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/1014-linuxkongress">Linux Kongress</a> will take
place in Saarbrücken, Germany, where Thomas Lange will give a <a
href="http://www.linux-kongress.org/2003/tutorials/index.html#1_1_6">\
tutorial</a> about building a beowulf cluster.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of the Debian-Installer DebCamp.</strong> Joey Hess sent in
a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0309/msg00850.html">summary</a>
of the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~pere/debian-installer/di-debcamp-2003-1.html">\
DebCamp</a>.  He reported that more than ten debian-installer developers met
for four days in <a href="http://oldenburger.linuxtage.de/Oldenburg2003/">\
Oldenburg</a> and worked quite successful on the new installer as the flood of
CVS messages demonstrated.  As a result PowerPC is perhaps better supported by
debian-installer right now than is i386.  Quite a lot of work was done on
general user interface issues.  Many issues have been resolved or worked
on.</p>

<p><strong>BrailleSpeak Debian Mini-Distribution.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.brlspeak.net/">BrailleSpeak</a> project <a
href="http://search.luky.org/cola.2003/msg01030.html">announced</a> the <a
href="http://www.brlspeak.net/release/">release</a> of their "BrlSpeak
Debian-based Braille-Loopback Mini-Distribution".  It provides a (temporary)
<a href="http://brlspeak.net/brlspeak-deb/iso/">solution</a> for those who
prefer installing a distribution on their FAT32 partition without having to
repartition the hard disk.  However, installation currently lacks speech
support.</p>

<p><strong>Installing different Sets of Debian Machines.</strong> Joseph
Rawson <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0309/msg01585.html">\
announced</a> paella, which is based on <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> and intends to support
installing different suites of software simultaneously.  To achieve this <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/paella/">paella</a> uses a PostgreSQL
database to store most of the configuration.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge Release Status.</strong> Scott James Remnant <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00018.html">checked</a> how
much of Anthony Towns' <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00010.html">release
timetable</a> has been met already.  The debian-installer has been tested and
proven to work on i386 and PowerPC already.  Package removals also dropped the
number of release critical bugs a lot.  Scott resumed with the statement that
we are roughly 14 days behind the schedule.</p>

<p><strong>Free Debian Logo License?</strong> Simon Law sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0310/msg00002.html">\
proposal</a> to change the Debian logo <a href="$(HOME)/logos/">license</a>
which is currently not free according to the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.  Mako Hill <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00206.html">added</a> that
there are a number of problems with Debian trademark policy.  This was part of
the rationale behind the creation of a <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/cgi-bin/listinfo/spi-trademark">trademark
committee</a> at SPI that is trying to draft some new legal policy
recommendations.</p>

<p><strong>Aptitude Annoyances and Improvements.</strong> Nathanael Nerode <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00074.html">complained</a>
about several annoying things in <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/aptitude">aptitude</a>.  Daniel Burrows <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00079.html">explained</a>
that he currently does not have enough time to get <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/aptitude">aptitude</a> working the way
he likes.  He also called for codevelopers who submit patches for the issues
he outlined.</p>

<p><strong>Package Description Quality.</strong> Wolfgang Borgert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00186.html">noticed</a>
some package descriptions that were not quite helpful such as "Foo is a GTK+
application, that enables bar".  He wondered where guidelines for good package
descriptions are located.  Mathieu Roy <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0310/msg00188.html">pointed out</a>
Colin Walters' <a href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/descriptions.html">\
guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>License Requirements for DSP Binaries.</strong> Thomas Hood <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg01020.html">wondered</a>
about the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/mwavem">mwavem</a> package that
includes binaries for the Mwave digital signal processor (DSP) chip found on
some ThinkPad laptops.  IBM distributes the driver in a <a
href="http://oss.software.ibm.com/acpmodem/">tarball</a> that says it is
licensed under the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a>.
However no source is distributed.  Glenn Maynard <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0309/msg01025.html">explained</a>
that the package cannot even be distributed in non-free if the source code is
not available.</p>

<p><strong>Embedded Debian Device won Prize.</strong> The German company <a
href="http://www.innominate.de/">Innominate</a> has won the Wolfsburg AG
Competence Prize, this year <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8505038381.html">awarded</a> for the
IT category in the field of Network Embedded Systems.  The awarded mGuard
security appliance runs a hardened Linux kernel 2.4 based on Debian 3.0 that
Innominate developed in-house.</p>
