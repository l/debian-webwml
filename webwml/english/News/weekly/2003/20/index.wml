<p>Welcome to this year's 20th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  While Debian is still fighting with some GCC 3.2 gotchas,
the compiler developers apparently <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.3/">\
released</a> version 3.3 already.  <a
href="http://www.libranet.com/">Libranet</a> has released version 2.8 A warm
fuzzy review of this release is <a
href="http://www.madpenguin.org/slashdot/libranet28.html">here</a> and yet
another one <a
href="http://www.distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-libranet">\
here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Leader Delegations.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00005.html">\
reported</a> about work he did during the last few weeks.  Manoj Srivastava
will continue to act as project secretary and Matt Zimmerman has become a full
member of the security team.  If you are interested in <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0109/msg00225.html">helping</a>
out with security then just go ahead and help.  Furthermore, Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/misc/memberships">memberships</a> in other organizations and
representatives are now documented.</p>

<p><strong>Report from Webb.it.</strong> Federico Di Gregorio wrote a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0509-webbit-report">report</a> about the Debian
presence at the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0509-webbit">webb.it</a>
conference that took place from 9th to 11th of May in Padova, Italy.  More
than 1000 workshops were held during this conference.  Italian Debian people
met a lot of other people interested in Free Software, installed Debian on
some machines, signed GPG keys, participated and held workshops and showed to
visitors a cluster of 4 Xbox machines running Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Debian MIA Check.</strong> James Troup <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00006.html">\
announced</a> actions that will be taken to handle maintainers that are
missing in action (MIA).  On the 12th March he sent out a maintainer ping to
191 possibly inactive Debian developers.  34 mails even bounced, 28
maintainers replied asking to be retired, 10 replied that they were still
active and 90 people didn't reply within the 2 month deadline.  Some accounts
will be disabled in the near future.</p>

<p><strong>Handling Donations for Debian.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00007.html">\
announced</a> that Mako Hill will compile a list of donations to the Debian
project that were collected outside of <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">\
SPI</a> and <a href="http://www.ffis.de/">ffis</a>, two non-profit
organisations that partner with Debian.  The people who hold still Debian
money (e.g., from previous trade shows) are asked to <a
href="mailto:accountant@debian.org">contact</a> him.</p>

<p><strong>Icon or no Icon in Menus?</strong> Somebody <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00629.html">suggested</a>
to use a default icon for applications in window-manager menus when the
application doesn't provide an icon.  Lars Wirzenius <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00679.html">argued</a>
against this idea, since the point of an icon is to be a visual symbol for the
application and not a random graphic.</p>

<p><strong>Some important orphaned Packages.</strong> Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00654.html">announced</a>
that he has orphaned several packages.  Many of these packages have either
outstanding release-critical bugs or have not been uploaded by the maintainer
recently.  He seeks for volunteers to fix those bugs and eventually adopt
these packages.</p>

<p><strong>Important Change in lm-sensors.</strong> David Maze <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00755.html">reported</a>
that the binary interface in libsensors1 has changed between lm-sensors 2.6.5
and 2.7.0 without a corresponding change in the library's soname.  The correct
action would be a changed soname which has to be done upstream, who did not
yet respond.  It has been suggested that he changes the soname of the library
within Debian in the meantime.</p>

<p><strong>Translation Dispute about changed Layout.</strong> There is a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-french-0305/msg00121.html">\
dispute</a> between the Apache maintainers and the French translation team.
The cause is a changed format of the package description for the French
translation which is not coherent with the original anymore.  Matthias Urlichs
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00946.html">added</a>
that in his opinion there is a perfectly valid reason to reformat the
description since English text usually is shorter than the equivalent in other
languages.</p>

<p><strong>Security Support for testing.</strong> Chris Leishman wrote a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00887.html">text</a> in
which he describes why Debian should support security in testing as well.
Matt Zimmerman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00886.html">explains</a>
that fixed packages will automatically migrate from unstable to testing.  If
unstable does not yet contain fixed packages it would be a waste of time
preparing updates for both, testing and unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Going to DebConf 3.</strong> Joachim Breitner <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00907.html">wondered</a> if
<a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0718-debconf">DebConf</a> is worth attending even
if one is not yet a registered developer.  Andreas Tille <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00918.html">explained</a>
that DebConf in Bordeaux was his most productive time to work for Debian.  He
adds that the fun thing is that there are a lot of competent people to ask for
help solving problems.</p>

<p><strong>Activating GNOME Font Settings.</strong> Sander Smeenk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00909.html">noticed</a>
that his font settings are stored but not activated when he restarts his X
session.  Ross Burton <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00912.html">explained</a>
that the XSETTINGS database is not populated because Sander doesn't start
GNOME via <code>gnome-session</code>.  In such a case
<code>gnome-settings-daemon</code> has to be executed from the startup script
manually.  Mateusz Papiernik <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00915.html">explained</a>
how such settings are written into the configuration file.</p>

<p><strong>Translation of Manual Pages.</strong> Denis Barbier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01089.html">noticed</a>
that there is currently no consensus whether translated manpages should be
shipped along with original manpages or within manpages-xx packages.  This
leads to conflicts when a translation is first shipped by the latter, then
incorporated into the former (e.g. when it becomes part of upstream
tarball).</p>

<p><strong>New-Maintainers' Package Repository.</strong> Daniel K. Gebhart <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg00756.html">announced</a>
the <a href="http://mentors.debian.net/">Debian Mentors Project</a> which
implements a package repository for people who have applied to become a Debian
developer but are not yet accepted.  Since only registered Debian developers
are allowed to upload packages directly into the official Debian archive,
prospective Developers are invited to use this service.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting off non-free Documentation.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0305/msg00250.html">announced</a>
that he finally split non-free components off of the <code>doc-linux</code>
package.  The new package <code>doc-linux-nonfree</code> is waiting for
ftpmaster approval, and may take a little while since it has a monster
copyright file.  Currently, just under 10&nbsp;% of the HOWTO and mini-HOWTO
documents are in non-free.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/FreeBSD Milestone.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0305/msg00002.html">announced</a>
that his GNU/FreeBSD chroot jail is finally self-hosting and that he was able
to build working packages of glibc 2.3, GCC 3.2.3 and binutils inside the
jail.  The <a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/">tarball</a>
has been uploaded, but explicitly states that this tarball is useless for
anything other than development or bug fixing.</p>

<p><strong>DFSG Analysis of Default LDP License.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0305/msg00282.html">investigated</a>
the <a href="http://www.tldp.org/manifesto.html">default license</a> of the <a
href="http://www.tldp.org/">Linux Documentation Project</a> (LDP) in detail.
It is also the most popular license among LDP documents.  He proposed to
rewrite several sections though, but the license basically is compliant with
the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">"Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New IPv6 Packages.</strong> Fabio Massimo Di Nitto <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6-0305/msg00000.html">announced</a> a
few changes that happened to the archive.  Until now the policy was to keep
all IPv6 packages aligned to the versions distributed in main.  It is time to
break this rule with two packages because we need to accelerate the testing
process.  The first package is <code>ntp-unstable</code>, a CVS snapshot of
ntp that supports IPv6 with one exception.  The second package is XFree86 4.3
from Daniel Stone which includes the IPv6 patch from X.org.</p>

<p><strong>Constitutional Amendment.</strong> Manoj Srivastava posted this <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00010.html">formal
proposal</a> to amend the Debian Constitution to introduce Condorcet/Clone
Proof SSD vote tallying in elections and general resolutions.  The proposed
changes are a result of the hard work of an election methods committee.  The
proposal received the necessary seconds and the official <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01286.html">discussion
period</a> ends on Friday May 30 23:59:59 UTC 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Testing the new Voting Scripts.</strong> Manoj Srivastava is
currently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0305/msg01289.html">conducting</a>
a vote to test the new voting scripts.  He is running this vote on his home
machine, pending the resolution of the fact that devotee does not run on
potato (vote.debian.org runs potato).  This vote includes a good test of the
super majority calculations, since two of the options require super majority.
The test vote involves picking one of nine colors and as Manoj said: "May the
best color win."</p>

<p><strong>Support for the Ogg Media Type.</strong> Ray Dassen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0305/msg00012.html">\
reported</a> that the Ogg bitstream format has been designated an official
MIME type in <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3534.txt">RFC 3534</a>.  It
would be good to see Debian support this MIME type as much as possible.  The
Ogg bitstream format is the container format employed for the well-known Ogg
Vorbis audio code.  Ray added an incomplete list of packages that require
modifications.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Stance on the SCO Allegation.</strong> It was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0305/msg00056.html">asked</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0305/msg00063.html">twice</a>
last week whether the <a
href="http://www.sco.com/scosource/complaint3.06.03.html">allegations</a> of
SCO, formerly know as Caldera, a GNU/Linux-oriented business, affect the
Debian project.  Ray Dassen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0305/msg00058.html">explained</a>
that the issue so far consists of allegations and rumors from a company that
is far along the way to obsolescence.  They have yet to produce anything that
could be remotely considered evidence, while there have been concrete
indications of SCO itself violating the GPL by the inclusion of GPLed
filesystem code from the Linux kernel into its proprietary (Unixware?) kernel.
A detailed <a href="http://www.opensource.org/sco-vs-ibm.html">analysis</a>
was released earlier by the Open Source Initiative.</p>

<p><strong>Report from the IFIT Conference.</strong> A <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0509-ifit-report">report</a> about the Debian
presence at the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0509-ifit">IFIT</a>
(Informationday Free Information Technology) that took place on 9th and
11th of May in Innsbruck, Austria, is online.  The conference started with a
panel discussion with politicians and continued with several workshops that
gave a detailed view of many projects, including the Debian development
model.</p>
