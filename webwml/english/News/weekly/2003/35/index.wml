# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 35th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The discussion about legalizing <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/">software patents</a> in Europe was held so <a
href="http://www.heise.de/newsticker/foren/go.shtml?read=1&amp;msg_id=4088125&amp;forum_id=46660">\
controversial</a> that the vote was postponed, as Ciaran O'Riordan from the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a> reported.  At the 10th international
conference of <a href="http://www.eajs.org/">European Association for
Japanese Studies</a> in Warsaw Janusz Bie&#324; gave a <a
href="http://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~jsbien/slajdy/JSB-EAJS03-s.pdf">talk</a> on
Debian GNU/Linux as a Japanese language teaching platform.</p>

<p><strong>Opteron Support for Debian.</strong> The Debian project has <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00035.html">received</a>
full access to a Dual Opteron <a
href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi?host=pergolesi">machine</a> for <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/amd64/">porting</a> efforts.  Mattias Wadenstein also
maintains a similar machine and hands out accounts to interested developers.
This port aims at supporting a mixed 32/64&nbsp;bit userland, which requires
significant <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00046.html">changes</a> in
the Debian infrastructure that will most probably not happen in time for the
release of sarge.  The developer list has also been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00104.html">renamed</a> to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/">debian-amd64</a> to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64-0308/msg00022.html">reflect</a> the
general architecture name.</p>

<p><strong>Per-User Init System.</strong> Jerry Haltom <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03466.html">wondered</a>
what others thought about a per-user init system that would be able to start
user-based services upon system startup without handing out root access to the
users.  However, Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03476.html">pointed</a> out
that this can already be achieved with an <code>@reboot</code> line in the
normal crontab.</p>

<p><strong>Binary Packages from multiple Sources.</strong> Glenn McGrath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03560.html">investigated</a>
lists of source and binary packages and discovered that, according to the
<code>.dsc</code> files, several binary packages were provided by more than
one source package.  In his opinion a virtual package should be used when a
binary package is provided by multiple source packages.</p>

<p><strong>LWN Subscription for Debian Developers.</strong> Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00019.html">\
reported</a> about HP sponsoring LWN subscription for Debian developers since
many people asked whether this offer still stands.  If you are a Debian
developer and want full access to <a href="http://lwn.net/">lwn.net</a>, go to
their website, create an account for yourself, then send a mail to
lwn-subscription@debian.org containing your LWN account name and sign this
mail with your key on the Debian keyring.  Eventually, Bdale will process the
request and send an acknowledgement.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Archive Growth.</strong> Jason Andrade <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03887.html">noticed</a>
that the Debian archive is about to hit the 100&nbsp;GB mark on his <a
href="http://ftp.au.debian.org/debian/">mirror</a> and wondered if there is
any way to reduce the size of the archive over the next weeks before he can
insert a new disk.  Josip Rodin <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03914.html">answered</a>
that about 7&nbsp;GB will be freed when potato is moved to <a
href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/">archive.debian.org</a>.
Marcelo Magallon <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03929.html">added</a> the
size of all binary packages belonging to the given architecture in the
specified suites.</p>

<p><strong>Survey about the Freeness of the FDL.</strong> Branden Robinson
posted the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0308/msg00017.html">\
results</a> of a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0308/msg01031.html">survey</a> to
measure the level of consensus on whether the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
(FDL) is considered a free license according to the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>
(DFSG) or not.  The majority of Debian developers and also the majority of
non-developers don't regard the GNU FDL as a license that can easily satisfy
the DFSG.</p>

<p><strong>Installer Packages spread throughout "main" and "contrib".</strong> Tore
Anderson <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03987.html">\
wondered</a> why installers of non-free software are located in supposedly
free sections.  He <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03990.html">explained</a>
that one would not expect non-free software to be installed on the system,
when using the contrib section.  Mathieu Roy <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0308/msg03991.html">added</a> that
software in contrib that has only the purpose of installing non-free software
in its postinst script is a good candidate for non-free itself.</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Morphix Founder.</strong> Prakash Advani conducted
an <a href="http://newsforge.com/newsforge/03/08/19/1518217.shtml">\
interview</a> with Alex de Landgraaf, the founder and the lead maintainer of
the <a href="http://morphix.sourceforge.net/">Morphix</a> project.  He
explained that Morphix, which is based on <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a>, has a modular design to
build a live CD, which would relieve all remasterers and let them work on the
actual task at hand.</p>

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-374">libpam-smb</a> --
