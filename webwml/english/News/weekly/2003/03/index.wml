# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's third issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The <a href="http://www.eff.org/">Electronic Frontier
Foundation</a> is <a href="http://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer.html">\
seeking</a> nominations for their annual Pioneer Awards, honoring those who
extend freedom and innovation in the information technology.  Nominations are
due by February 1st, 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Rescuing /var.</strong>  Nicholas
Petreley of <a href="http://www.linuxworld.com/">LinuxWorld.com</a> somehow
managed to backup the <a
href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0113.petreley.html">wrong
partition</a> and found himself with a Debian system missing the
<code>/var</code> directory.  All the important package information lives in
<code>/var/lib/dpkg</code>, in particular the
<code>/var/lib/dpkg/status</code> file.  Nicholas describes the <a
href="http://www.linuxworld.com/2003/0113.petreley-p2.html">three
lessons</a> he learned in recovering from the accidental deletion of the
<code>/var/lib/dpkg</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>Debian older than Humanity?</strong>  Tomas Pospisek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01114.html">reported</a>
that the <a href="$(HOME)/logos/">Debian Swirl</a> can be
cleary seen on one of the <a
href="http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/1996/01/image">pictures</a>
taken by NASA's orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  For example, check the
lower right hand corner of the <a
href="http://imgsrc.hubblesite.org/hu/db/1996/01/images/e/formats/full_jpg.jpg">image</a>.
Perhaps this is proof that the seeds for Debian were sowed long before the dawn
of humanity.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Presentations.</strong> Wolfgang Borgert was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00991.html">looking</a> for
a set of slides on dpkg, apt-get and debconf.  Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01022.html">intends</a>
to provide a 'presentations' section in the <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/ddp/?cvsroot=debian-doc">Debian Documentation
Project</a> (DDP) and has already created an <a
href="http://dat.etsit.upm.es/~jfs/debian/www/ddp/slides/">archive</a> of
slides.  Whilst the Debian web site does link to <a
href="$(HOME)/events/talks">talks</a> given by developers and
some <a href="$(HOME)/events/materials/slides/">sample
slides</a>, it is difficult to gather this information and publish it in a
homogeneous way.  Talks should be reported to events@debian.org and forwarded
to him.</p>

<p><strong>Making Debconf Mandatory for Prompting Users?</strong>  Adrian
Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00949.html">suggested</a>
to change the Debian policy to require all user prompts in maintainer
scripts to be performed by <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/debconf">debconf</a>.
This would greatly ease things like automated upgrading of multiple
computers.  Petter Reinholdtsen provided a list of <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg00988.html">packages</a>
that he had trouble with because they do not use debconf.
And as a bonus, debconf templates can easily be translated.</p>

<p><strong>MingW32 for all Architectures?</strong> Currently, the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/mingw32">MingW32</a>
package is only released for the IA-32 architecture for no technical reason.
However, Steven G. Johnson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00182.html">reported</a>
that he has modified the build process and <a
href="http://jdj.mit.edu/~stevenj/mingw32/">built</a> the package on the
PowerPC platform.  He emphasises that the only code that is actually compiled
for a non-x86 host belongs to gcc and binutils.  Hence, the package should
work on all architectures, unless there is a bug in GCC.  Ron Lee indicated
that new packages will be uploaded, which should run on all architectures.</p>

<p><strong>Antialiasing with GNOME.</strong> Bill Moseley <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0301/msg01826.html">discovered</a>
antialiased fonts, which however he wanted to turn off, Michael Sullivan also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0301/msg01834.html">noticed</a> a
major upgrade with regards to font antialiasing.  Fonts should look smoother
but some people find that they just seem blurred, that they are more difficult
to read, and even hurt the eyes.  GTK 2.2 provides support for them but
this feature can easily be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01152.html">turned off</a>
with an environment variable.</p>

<p><strong>Documenting Package Tuning.</strong> Andreas Tille noted that there
are several situations where packages have to be configured to work together
under certain circumstances of operation or hardware technology.  This may be
difficult.  He came up with an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01164.html">idea</a> to
collect some kind of knowledge base for those cases.  This should probably be
written by the community and could be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0301/msg01353.html">maintained</a>
as a Wiki, <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/ddp">DDP</a> document or database.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting out Documentation Packages.</strong> Adam Heath almost <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00173.html">ran</a> out of
space and noticed that his <code>/usr/share/doc</code> directory contains
380&nbsp;MB of documentation.  Adrian von Bidder <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00183.html">concluded</a>
that documentation which uses a significant amount of space should be split
out into a documentation package and neither of them should depend on each
other.  Jochen Voss finally proposed a policy <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0301/msg00208.html">\
recommendation</a> for such a package split.</p>

<p><strong>License Problem with Glibc.</strong> Johan Walles <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0301/msg00288.html">reported</a>
about <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/171659">bug #171659</a> that reveals that
glibc contains sourcecode from Sun Microsystems, Inc.  Brian Carlson says that
it places restrictions on distribution as an independent work, failing <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a> paragraph 1. It also fails DFSG paragraph 3
because it prohibits distribution of modifications of the original work as
modifications.  Jeff Bailey is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-glibc-0301/msg00291.html">working</a>
with upstream to start a reimplementation.</p>

<p><strong>KDE&nbsp;3.1 and Ägypten for Woody.</strong> Ralf Nolden <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0301/msg00485.html">announced</a>
that he has uploaded Debian packages for KDE&nbsp;3.1 and woody and i386 to the <a
href="http://ktown.kde.org/~nolden/kde/woody/">KTown</a> server.  While he was
at it he added a complete set of woody packages for <a
href="http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/">&Auml;gypten</a>.  This includes required
packages that were backported from unstable where available.</p>

<p><strong>Conferences in January.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2003/20030119">announced</a> that it will be present at
three conferences this month.  The first one refers to the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0120-linuxconf">Debian Mini-Conf</a> prior to the <a
href="http://www.linux.conf.au/">Linux Conference Australia</a> where many
Debian developers will attend and give <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/lca2003/schedule/">talks</a> on various topics.
From January 22nd to 24th Debian will maintain a booth at the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0122-lwce-ny">Linuxworld Conference and Expo</a> in
New York and from January 23rd to 26th the Debian project will maintain a
booth at the <a href="$(HOME)/events/2003/0123-hct">Hamburger Computer
Tage</a> in Hamburg, Germany.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at CeBIT Exhibition?</strong> The Debian project has been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0301/msg00018.html">\
offered</a> to participate in the upcoming CeBIT exhibition in Germany.  This
could include installations on customers' notebooks, a booth, presentations and
talks.  Even though booths don't have to be present on all days, it would be
easier to maintain if at least one person would be around on all days.
Michael Meskes <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0301/msg00020.html">\
offered</a> to give some talks and Roland Bauerschmidt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0301/msg00019.html">\
volunteered</a> for the booth.  The time to organize things is very tight, so
active people are needed.</p>
