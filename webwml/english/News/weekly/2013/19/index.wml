<toc-add-entry name="bits-rt">Bits from the Release Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Niels Thykier <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/10/msg00004.html">announced
in the bits from the Release Team</a> that Jessie, the current testing
version of Debian, will be frozen next year on 5 November 2014, at 23:59 UTC.
A draft of the freeze policy, describing the changes that can be considered
for inclusion in Jessie after the freeze, is already
<a href="https://release.debian.org/jessie/freeze_policy.html">available</a>.

Niels also summarised the results of the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/09/msg00002.html">porter roll-call</a>
of architectures in unstable and testing, and indicated that the 
<a href="https://release.debian.org/jessie/arch_qualify.html">architecture qualification page</a>
has been updated to include the names of the current porters.

To conclude, he itemised the list of release goals that have been proposed and
that will be reviewed by the Release Team for possible adoption, and indicated that
Britney, the testing migration script, and build services are now able to
understand and process <q>pkg:any</q> multiarch dependency relationships.

<toc-add-entry name="s390">s390 removed from the archive in favour of s390x</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Julien Cristau announced the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/10/msg00005.html">removal
of the s390 architecture from Jessie</a>. s390 was an official architecture
for IBM servers since Woody and has been replaced by s390x, its 64-bit
counterpart, since the release of Wheezy. The process was completed by the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/10/msg00323.html">removal
of s390 from Sid</a> as reported by Mark Hymers.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="manpages">manpages.debian.net now an official service</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Thanks to
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-doc/2013/10/msg00026.html">Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña</a>
and the Debian System Administrators Team, the service providing on-line
versions of any manual page available in Debian, previously available from the
unofficial debian.net domain, can now be reached at
<a href="https://manpages.debian.org">https://manpages.debian.org</a>.

The service is especially useful for users who need to read manual
pages from packages that are not installed.

<toc-add-entry name="webservers">Debian increases its popularity on web servers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
According to a
<a href="http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/debian_ubuntu_extend_the_dominance_in_the_linux_web_server_market_at_the_expense_of_red_hat_centos">recent
W3Techs survey</a>, Debian continues to be the
most popular GNU/Linux distribution on web servers, and has increased its
popularity from 29.4% in January 2012 (when it overtook CentOS to take
the lead) to 32.7% in October 2013. Debian's derivative
Ubuntu is also growing, and the two together have a double lead (58.5% of
Linux web servers use Debian/Ubuntu). The survey is based on the analysis of
the top million web sites according to Alexa, in order to select a
representative sample of established sites, and focused only on the
technologies used for web sites (and not individual web pages or
desktop installations).
