<toc-add-entry name="opwmatch">Debian Outreach Program for Women matching fund 2013</toc-add-entry>
<p>
In an effort to get more women involved in FOSS, the Debian Project will be
participating in the GNOME Foundation's 
<a href="https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">Outreach
Program for Women (OPW)</a>, which is an internship program similar to Google's
Summer of Code.

Unlike the Google program, OPW does not require participants to be students,
and as well as coding projects it can also cover non-coding tasks such as
translation, graphic design, documentation, bug triage and
marketing. 

In order to aid this effort, one of Debian's generous sponsors has offered to
start a matching fund in USD to fund Debian's participation in OPW.

For details, and to give a donation, please see 
<a href="http://debian.ch/opw2013">our <q>Donate now</q> page</a>.

Please do think about getting involved and sharing your ideas with us, to help
us make OPW an even more useful program for Debian in the future.

If you wish to apply as an intern participant, please review the available
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2013/Projects">coding</a>
and
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen/NonCodingProjects">non-coding</a>
internships and follow 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">the instructions for
application</a>.

Among other topics, Lucas called for more developers for dak (Debian Archive
Kit), the software suite behind the Debian archive,
and debbugs, the software behind the Debian bug tracking system.
If you want to contribute to one of these two critical pieces of software from Debian's
infrastructure, you can contact their respective teams directly via their
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-dak/">mailing</a>

<p>
Niels Thykier, on behalf of the Release Team,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/09/msg00006.html">announced</a>
that autoremoval of packages with release-critical bugs has been activated in
the testing suite:
if a non-<a href="http://udd.debian.org/cgi-bin/key_packages.yaml.cgi">key</a>
package suffers from a bug considered as critical for the release in testing
and unstable suites, and this bug hasn't seen any activity for 14 days, it will
be automatically marked for removal from the testing suite.
