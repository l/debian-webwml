<toc-add-entry name="pointrelease">Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.7 released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The seventh <a href="$(HOME)/News/2013/20130223">update for Debian 6.0
(codenamed <q>Squeeze</q>)</a> has been released. This update mainly adds
corrections of security problems to the stable release, along with some
adjustments for serious problems.

<toc-add-entry name="gsoc">Call for projects and mentors for Debian GSoC 2013</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Paul Tagliamonte, newly appointed <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00006.html">administrator
for Debian participation in the Google Summer of Code
program 2013</a>, asked all Debian contributors for <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/02/msg00007.html">projects
and mentors</a> to help Debian participate in the initiative this year.
<q>Everyone (member of the Debian project or not, student or
not) is welcome to submit
their ideas, and to try and find people willing to mentor the
projects</q>, explained Paul in his mail. Information on how to
submit proposals is available in the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2013">relevant wiki page</a>.
You can also contact Paul and the other GSoC administrators for Debian on their
<a href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/soc-coordination">mailing
list</a> or on their IRC channel, <tt>#debian-soc</tt> on irc.debian.org.

<toc-add-entry name="wheezy">Wheezy release progress</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Niels Thykier, release team member, noticed that the
<a href="http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2013/02/28/wheezy-release-progress-february/">current
pace of <acronym title="Release-Critical">RC</acronym> bug fixes
is slowing down</a>, with only 1.1 RC bugs fixed a day since
<a href="http://nthykier.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/wheezy-release-progress-january/">his
last report</a>.
About 200 RC bugs are left to be fixed, and if the pace
of RC bug fixes does not pick up, the release team may
need to remove packages along with their reverse dependencies.

<p>
Hideki Yamane reported about <a
href="http://henrich-on-debian.blogspot.com/2013/02/open-source-conference-2013-tokyospring.html">Debian
participation at Open Source Conference 2013 Tokyo/Spring</a> at Meisei
University, in Tokyo, Japan. Debian was present with a booth where Hideki
and other contributors talked with users and enthusiasts. Takahide Nojima
delivered a talk titled <q>Debian Update</q> focused on the latest Debian
achievements.

<toc-add-entry name="arm">arm64 image available</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Wookey announced the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2013/02/msg00413.html">availability
of the arm64 image</a>. This is the culmination of a
three year long effort to make Debian bootstrappable, which has been 
used for the first time on the port to the 64-bit ARMv8
architecture. Whilst it should be considered alpha-grade for now, it
represents a great achievement: <q>all these packages were cross-built on
raring, untangling cyclic dependencies with build profiles making this the first
(non x86) self-bootstrapped Debian port ever</q>, explained Wookey.
<q>Getting this port working has been <q>interesting</q> because it's
attempting four new things all at once: multiarch (file layouts and dependencies),
crossbuilding (tools and packaging support in a distro that historically
was always natively built), arm64 (aarch64) support in
packages that need it, and build-profiles to linearise the
build-order</q>, he added.
The <a href="http://people.linaro.org/~wookey/buildd/raring-arm64/status-bootstrap.html">current
status of the bootstrap</a> is online,
whilst more information on the port (and how to build
images) is available on the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Arm64Port">wiki page of the project</a>.

QA tool</a> for finding packages' inadequacies (broken symlinks, missing
copyright files, obsolete conffiles, etc.) called
