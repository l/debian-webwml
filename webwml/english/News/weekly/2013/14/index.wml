of obsolete delegations</a>, Lucas Nussbaum has updated the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00004.html">delegation
for the Policy Editors</a>, welcoming Jonathan Nieder to the team, and the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00005.html">delegation 
for the summer of code administrators</a>, welcoming Sukhbir Singh officially
among them. More updates will follow.

Lucas Nussbaum mentioned that Debian does now have a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/06/msg00132.html">Trademark
Team</a>. A more official announcement is still to come.

the Trademark Team is currently working on getting the Debian logo registered,
and on clarifying the status of Debian-related domain names.

<p>
During their previous

Administrators (DSA) set a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2013/06/msg00606.html">list of
requirements</a> they consider necessary to support a port for the next stable
release. They listed some specific concerns for the following architectures:
armel, armhf, hurd, mips, mipsel, sparc, and s390/x. Most of them are
currently being addressed, but porters may welcome help.
