passwords reset</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve McIntyre, administrator of the Debian wiki, announced that 
due to a security breach,
<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/01/msg00000.html">all
<tt>wiki.debian.org</tt> account passwords are being reset</a>.
In order to regain access to your wiki account, you'll need to
follow the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/FrontPage?action=recoverpass">password
recovery process</a>.
In the mail, Steve explained that the Debian Security Team recently
found a
<a href="http://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2593">vulnerability</a>
in the moin package which had been succesfully exploited for
<tt>wiki.debian.org</tt>.
The wiki has already been moved to another server and an audit of the old
server is ongoing.
