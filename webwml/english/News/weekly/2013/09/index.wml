<p>
Neil McGovern, on behalf of the Release Team, announced 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/04/msg00006.html">that the
next stable version of Debian, <q>Wheezy</q>, will be released during the first weekend
of May (4/5 May)</a>.
Help with the final touches is welcome: 
<q>release notes, installation guides and documentation in
general, especially translations can always do with some work. Please
see previous mails on these, and help if you can</q>, explained Neil.


And to show Debian your love, you can organise a

<toc-add-entry name="qt5">First Qt 5 packages in experimental</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer announced that
<a href="http://perezmeyer.blogspot.it/2013/04/on-road-to-qt-5-qt-5-base-tools.html">the
first Qt 5 packages have been accepted in the experimental suite</a>.
For now they are available only for the 64-bit PC (amd64) architecture, but soon they will be
available in the 32-bit PC flavour as well. As for the ARM based ones, it will take a bit more time.
These packages have no GLES2 or Wayland support, but
non-official packages with GLES2/Wayland enabled will be provided at some point, for testing
purposes.
<br />
As for future plans, Lisandro said that <q>other parts of Qt 5 are on the way. And remember, 
these packages would not have been possible if it weren't for the great Debian's pkg-kde team</q>.
