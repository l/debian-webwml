Lucas Nussbaum also sent his
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/07/msg00002.html">monthly
report of DPL activities for June 2013</a>.
Among other things, Lucas mentioned the current state of the NEW queue, where
<a href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/new.html">nearly 300 packages are waiting</a>.
The FTP team welcomed
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/07/msg00003.html">four
new members</a> ten days ago to help them process the NEW packages, but they are
still <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2012/18/#ftpteam">looking for help</a>.
He also mentioned that Debian is now part of the
<a href="http://networktimefoundation.org/">Network Time Foundation</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="community">Community distribution</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Debian topped a poll on the
<a href="http://fossforce.com/2013/07/debian-tops-our-community-distro-poll/">FOSS
Force blog</a> asking readers to name a <q>legitimate community
distribution</q>. 255 people took part in the poll, and as multiple
choices were allowed a total of 855 votes were cast. Debian received
173 votes (20%), with Arch Linux (141 votes, 16%) and Linux Mint
(95 votes, 11%) behind it. Interestingly, the results were in line
with the opinions of the blog's editors about what it means to be a
community distribution.
