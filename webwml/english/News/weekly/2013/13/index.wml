<toc-add-entry name="debconf">DebConf13 will have its DebCamp</toc-add-entry>

<p>
When the DebConf team 
<a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf13/ma_dc13_venue_and_dates.dc">announced
the official location and dates for DebConf13</a>, there was much uncertainty about whether
a DebCamp could be organised, for budget reasons.
The DebConf team has now <a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf13/dr_dc13_debcamp_and_reconfirmation.dc">announced</a>
that DebConf13 will have its DebCamp, which will last for almost a full week,
starting from August 6, at the main conference venue.
</p>

<p>
If you plan to go to DebConf13, you have until June 30 to
<a href="http://lists.debconf.org/lurker/message/20130619.142526.7e2cb16b.en.html">reconfirm</a>
your attendance and thus validate your registration.

<toc-add-entry name="codesearch">Debian Code Search on video</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Debian Code Search is a search engine written by Michael Stapelberg
for source code distributed by Debian. It can be used from codesearch.debian.net.
Michael Stapelberg 
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~stapelberg//2013/06/17/debian-code-search-talk.html">wrote
on his blog</a> that the video of the talk he gave at GPN13 about Debian
Code Search is
<a href="http://ftp.ccc.de/events/gpn/gpn13/gpn13-debian-code-search.mp4">available</a>.
He explains the motivation behind this project and how the code works.
The talk is in German, but Michael created 
<a href="http://t.zekjur.net/gpn13-debian-code-search.srt">English subtitles</a>, so that more people can enjoy the video.

<toc-add-entry name="dsasprint">Bits from the Debian System Administrators</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Peter Palfrader sent a 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/06/msg00164.html">report
on the DSA team sprint</a>, which took place recently in LinuxHotel,
Essen, Germany.

During this meeting, Debian system administrators discussed among other
things the progress of the migration of services from physical to
virtual machines, the deployment of a Content Delivery Network for
static data served by webservers, the possibility of authenticating
alioth users via Debian's Single Sign-On server, and longer term goals
for configuration management.
They listed the points of contact for the DSA team and
their current guidelines.

The DSA team thanks the LinuxHotel and the Electrical &amp; Computer
Engineering and Information Technology departments of the University of
British Columbia, who made this meeting possible.
