<toc-add-entry name="gsoc">Welcome to Debian GSoC Students</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian project is proud to announce that 
<a href="http://bits.debian.org/2013/05/welcome-gsoc-students-2013.html">this
year, 16 students have been accepted into the Google Summer of Code program</a>
to work on improving Debian. This is the highest number of students accepted
since Debian started participating in this program.

The list of selected students and the projects they're working on is
<a href="http://bits.debian.org/2013/05/welcome-gsoc-students-2013.html">publicly</a>
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2013/debian">available</a>.

If you are interested in one of these projects, you are encouraged to come and
join the #debian-soc IRC channel, or to contact the students and their
mentors directly.

<toc-add-entry name="opw">Outreach Program for Women, the result of the experiment</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Mònica Ramírez Arceda <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2013/06/msg00002.html">announced
the result</a> of Debian participation in the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/OutreachProgramForWomen">Outreach Program for
Women</a>. One of the four applicants was accepted, but also received a
slot for the Google Summer of Code. As a consequence, this internship was not used.
Since the Outreach Program for Women is run twice a year, Mònica has opened the
discussion about further Debian participation with a call for more volunteers.
Join the #debian-opw IRC channel if you are willing to help with this initiative.

<toc-add-entry name="dplbits">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Lucas Nussbaum sent his
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00000.html">monthly
report of DPL activities for May 2013</a>. Among other things, Lucas reminded
readers that it could still be possible to submit talks for
<a href="http://debconf13.debconf.org/">DebConf13, in Vaumarcus, Switzerland</a>,
and called for the creation of a Debian trademark team, handling the trademark use
requests that are being received following the publication of the
<a href="$(HOME)/trademark#policy">Debian trademark policy</a>. He also
mentioned that discussions which occurred during the last DPL campaign have
been summarised by Brian Gupta on a
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL/Ideas">dedicated
page of the Debian Wiki</a>, and encouraged people to contribute to maintaining
this page when ideas are raised on Debian lists.

<toc-add-entry name="dmo">Expiration of debian-multimedia.org</toc-add-entry>

<p>
debian-multimedia.org was a popular unofficial repository of Debian
packages. Last year, this service moved to a new domain, and despite efforts
from Debian, the debian-multimedia.org domain recently expired, and has now
been registered by someone unknown to Debian.

<q>This is a good example of the importance of the use of cryptography to secure
APT repositories</q>,
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/06/msg00000.html">DPL
Lucas Nussbaum said</a>.

The Debian project would like to emphasise the need to consider possible
security issues when using third-party repositories and the importance of not
blindly adding keys to the APT keyring.
