<p>
27 months after the release of Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>, a new
stable version of the Debian operating system, Debian 7.0
<q>Wheezy</q>, <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2013/20130504">was released
on May 4, 2013</a>. Among other improvements, this release
brings to its users <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110726b">multiarch
support</a>, <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120425">various tools to
deploy private clouds</a>, an improved installer supporting software
speech, which makes accessibility one of its strong points,
and an expanded set of multimedia codecs.
<br />
Adam D. Barratt, Release Team manager, has already announced a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2013/05/msg00003.html">first
point release planned for next month</a> and given advice to maintainers about
further uploads to <q>unstable</q>: the development of <q>Jessie</q> is already
starting.  <br />
Joerg Jaspert, Debian FTP master, gave some <a

workflow needed by the FTP team to release a new stable version of Debian</a>,
while Raphael Geissert <a
href="http://rgeissert.blogspot.com/2013/05/almost-one-million-requests-per-day.html">noted</a>
that <q>in the first 48 hours after its log files were rotated last Sunday, <a
href="http://http.debian.net">http.debian.net</a> handled almost 2 million
requests, for an average of 11 requests per second</q>.  <br />
Meanwhile, <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ReleasePartyWheezy">Debian users and
enthusiasts from all over the world are organising parties</a> to celebrate the
release of <q>Wheezy</q>: the <a

<toc-add-entry name="coding-freedom-book"><q>Coding Freedom</q>: a closer look at Debian contributors</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Gabriella Coleman announced the recent publication of her book,
<a href="http://codingfreedom.com/">"Coding Freedom: The Ethics and Aesthetics 
of Hacking"</a>, which was mostly inspired by Debian's community and active 
members. The book strives to identify and explain the key factors that have
influenced the development of free software projects, while examining the
social impact they have had. A good portion was based on Debian, following two years
of ethnographic research. There is one chapter dedicated to the project and 
many others draw on interviews with Debian developers.
<br>
The book is available under a Creative Commons license and freely
<a href="http://codingfreedom.com/buy_download.html">available for download</a>.
