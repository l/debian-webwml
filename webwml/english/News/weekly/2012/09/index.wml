<toc-add-entry name="cloud">Deploy your own <q>cloud</q> with Debian
<q>Wheezy</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Project 
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120425">has announced the
availability, for its testing distribution, of some packages to create
a private cloud</a>: among others,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/xcp-xapi">xcp-xapi</a>
and <a href="http://packages.debian.org/wheezy/nova-xcp-plugins">nova-xcp-plugins</a>.
<q>Preserving user freedoms in the cloud is a tricky business and one of
the major challenges ahead for Free Software. By easing the deployment of
Debian-based private clouds we want to help our users in resisting the
lure of giving up their freedoms in exchange of some flexibility,</q>
said Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader.

<toc-add-entry name="DebianTour">Debian Tour in Nicaragua</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Nicaraguan community is organising the 
<a href="http://linuxtour.org/Debian_tour">Debian Tour</a>: from April to
June, members of the local Debian community will deliver talks in several
universities in Nicaragua, helping students to learn
about the Debian Project and Free Software in general.
The tour started in the city of Masaya, and will touch other cities such as 
Managua and León.
On May 5th, Debian Tour will take place at UCA (the future DebConf12 venue) 
and special visitors, the Debian Developers and DebConf chairs, Gunnar Wolf 
and Holger Levsen, will attend this time.

<p>
Jérôme Kieffer noticed that 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-science/2012/04/msg00044.html">the
European Synchrotron in Grenoble</a> is migrating its computing
infrastructure to Debian: the computer controlling the
particle accelerator has already been migrated, as well as some data
analysis servers and part of the computer cluster.
The <a href="http://www.esrf.eu">European Synchrotron Radiation
Facility</a> (<q>ESRF</q>) is a joint facility supported and shared by
various European countries which operates the most powerful synchrotron
radiation source in Europe.
<q>For data analysis Debian offers both the richest environment including
the most used software and libraries in our field of research, and a rock
solid distribution with security fixes,</q> added Jérôme in
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2012/04/msg00157.html">another
mail</a>.

Japan to SPI.
Stefano also gave
