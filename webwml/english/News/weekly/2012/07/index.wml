<toc-add-entry name="med">Bits from Debian Med team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Andreas Tille sent some 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00009.html">bits
from the Debian Med team</a>, where he talked about recent initiatives of the
team including the <a href="http://debian-med.alteholz.de/advent/"><q>Debian
Med Bug Squashing Advent Calendar 2011</q></a> and the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/MoM"><q>Mentoring of the Month</q>
(MoM)</a> project.
Andreas also reminded us that in January the Debian Med project
reached 10: in ten years, Debian Med has grown from a one man project to a
<q>strong team maintaining a set of over 200 highly specialised packages
with a high quality standard</q>, as Andreas said in a 
<a href="http://debianmed.blogspot.com/2012/01/10-anniversary-of-debian-med-posted-by.html">related
blogpost</a>.
The Debian Med project not only provides and maintains specialised packages
for biology and medicine, but is — like other Debian Blends — <q>a nice
entry point for people to join Debian because newcomers can identify
themselves with a known topic (the scope of the Blend — in this case
medicine and bioinformatics) first and learn Debian rules in a team with
common interest</q>, added Andreas in the mail. 
This idea was confirmed by the results of a 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/Developers">survey focused on
why Debian Med team members became Debian Developers</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="OSI">Debian joins the OSI</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian project announced that it is
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120330">joining the <q>Open
Source Initiative (OSI)</q></a> as an affiliate. The OSI was founded in
1998 with the aim of explaining, advocating, and protecting the term 
<q>open source</q>.
For many years now, the OSI has helped the <q>Open Source</q> trademark
gain recognition, particularly in the corporate world.

<toc-add-entry name="admins">Report from DSA Team sprint</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Luca Filipozzi wrote a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/03/msg00032.html">report
from the Debian System Administrators (<q>DSA</q>) team's sprint</a> held
over the weekend of 16-18 March in Oslo, Norway. 
During the meeting the team discussed a long-term plan for Debian's
infrastructure, reviewing the machines currently administrated, and
formulating procedures regarding account and group management.
One of the main points discussed at the meeting was the necessity to
renew the set of machines — which are now old and long out of warranty —
and how to do it. While in the past Debian's hardware requirements were
met by donations of new and used hardware from individuals and
organizations, this is no longer true.
The team elaborated a <q>Five Year Plan</q> for
a hardware refresh cycle to avoid to having machines more than five years
old.
<q>A clear outcome of our work on the Five Year Plan is an understanding
that hardware has now become one of the biggest expense categories for
Debian</q>, said Luca.
Various machines are also needed in order to support the whole set of
architectures for which Debian is shipped.
For more information on how to donate equipment to the Debian Project,
please contact the <a href="mailto:hardware-donations@debian.org">hardware donations
team</a>.
<br />
The DSA sprint was made possible by
<a href="$(HOME)/donations">donations</a> to Debian
and by Varnish Software who hosted it and provided food and
drink. Thank you!

<toc-add-entry name="trek"><q>Fascinating</q>: a Debian based tricorder</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Peter Jansen, a cognitive science researcher, 
<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2012/03/researcher-publishes-specs-for-real-linux-powered-star-trek-tricorder">brought
to life Spock's tricorder</a> from the popular Star Trek television series. 
Peter, in fact, developed a handheld device able — thanks to its
embedded sensors — to measure various environmental parameters (like
temperature, humidity, magnetic fields, etc.). The device runs Debian
GNU/Linux on an ARM920T-based Atmel microcontroller: the hardware
specifications and schematics, and the software are licensed respectively 
under TAPR non-commercial and GPL 3 and are available on 
<a href="http://www.tricorderproject.org/">the project website</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="alexmeike">So long, and thanks for all the news</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The year was 2006. The place: Oaxtepec, Mexico. The event: DebConf6.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/06/msg00005.html">This 
is how the Publicity team was born</a>, during a BoF titled
<q>Representing Debian</q>. And among others there were two Debian
contributors (who later became Debian Developers), Alexander Schmehl and Meike
Reichle.
If you are a regular reader of Debian Project News, or a contributor to
the Publicity Team, you'll surely recognize their names: they worked
every day for the last six years to bring us news about the Debian world
and to announce important changes inside the project.
Alexander and Meike have now decided to 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00011.html">step
down from the Press and Publicity team</a> and start 
<a href="http://blog.alphascorpii.net/english/personal/to-those.html">another,
different adventure</a>. The Publicity Team would like to thank them for their tireless
effort, their creativity and their inspiring work.

<br />
So long, and thanks for all the news!

Jan Hauke Rahm wrote a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00014.html">report
from the Front Desk and DAM sprint</a> that was recently held in 
Mönchengladbach, Germany. During the meeting, the members of both teams
worked on the <a href="https://nm.debian.org/"><q>New
Members</q> web interface</a>, as well as on
long-outstanding cases of NM applicants. The meeting turned out to be a great chance to discuss
face-to-face and in person delicate cases and
to work on the pending requests.
Both teams would like to thank Credativ who hosted the meeting.
