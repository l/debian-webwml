<toc-add-entry name="artwork">New artwork for <q>Wheezy</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <q><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/Joy">Joy</a></q> theme has been
<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/d/desktop-base/news/20120623T111737Z.html">selected</a>
as the default artwork for Debian systems for the upcoming release of Debian 7.0 (Wheezy).
The theme is intended to appeal by being efficient with a light and simple theme.
There is also a fancier variant called <q>Joy Inksplat</q> available in the
desktop-base package for those who prefer a more fun desktop. For the release
after Wheezy, there are early thoughts about introducing multiple themes, more
fine-grained theme packages and metapackages for selecting among them.

<toc-add-entry name="debconf">Reports from DebCamp</toc-add-entry>
<p>
DebCamp took place last week at the Universidad Centroamericana in Managua,
Nicaragua. This week has been very productive,
as can be seen from people's reports: Christian Perrier
described <a href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/07/06#debcamp-work">on his blog</a>
his work on internationalisation, localisation and Samba packaging; Joey Hess
mentioned his progress on
<a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/git-annex-assistant_milestone/">git-annex
assistant</a> and
<a href="http://joeyh.name/blog/entry/debian-cd_work_at_DebCamp/">Debian
CDs</a>; Gregor Herrmann wrote about
<a href="http://info.comodo.priv.at/blog/archives/2012/07/#e2012-07-06T22_59_21.txt">his work
within the Debian Perl Group</a>;
Steve McIntyre wrote about his <a href="http://blog.einval.com/2012/07/06#debcamp1">preparations</a>
for the six sessions he is running; and Gunnar Wolf reported that
<a href="http://gwolf.org/blog/arrived-nicaragua-debcamp-has-officially-started">DebCamp
has officially started</a>.
<br />
DebCamp is followed this week by DebConf12, the conference for Debian
developers, which started with the <a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120706">Debian
Day</a>, an open event for enthusiasts, users, developers and anyone interested
in finding out more about Debian and Free Software. The whole of DebConf is
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120707">covered on video</a> (which makes many
people <a href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf12/hl_dc12_video.dc">happy</a>).
The schedule of the
conference and the relevant links for the video streaming are available on the
<a href="http://debconf12.debconf.org/video.xhtml">dedicated DebConf page</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli sent his <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/07/msg00001.html">monthly
report</a> on DPL activities from DebConf12. During this month, Debian joined the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/secure-boot-vs-restricted-boot/statement">FSF campaign on secure boot</a>,
and DuckDuckGo sent the first report of a donation after the agreement on revenue
sharing. Stefano also mentions some
interesting discussions for project evolution, in particular the proposals
 <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/06/msg00029.html">to
change the way DM permissions are handled</a> and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/06/msg00125.html">
to change the policy ruling the debian.net domain</a>.
</p>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli delivered his final
<q><a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc12_schedule/events/881.en.html">Bits from the DPL</a></q>
talk on the first day of <a href="http://debconf12.debconf.org/">DebConf12</a>. In his talk
(<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/talks/2012/20120708-dc12-dpl.pdf">slides</a>) he
spoke about the early history of Debian, where we are today, how our place in the wider
free software community has evolved, and our principles; he summed up by stating that
<q>we play a <b>fundamental role</b> in Free Software</q>. He then explored the challenges
that we face in meeting our responsibility to live up to our role in the Free Software community,
including keeping contribution levels healthy, increasing the diversity of our community,
being on time with releases, keeping release freezes short, collective code ownership,
low company involvement and how the <acronym lang="en" title="Debian Project Leader">DPL</acronym>
role might need to evolve in the future.

<toc-add-entry name="udd">Debian Maintainer Dashboard, a new UDD frontend</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Lucas Nussbaum <a href="http://www.lucas-nussbaum.net/blog/?p=722">announced on his blog</a>
the creation of the <a href="http://udd.debian.org/dmd.cgi">Debian Maintainer Dashboard</a>, a service
relying on <acronym lang="en" title="Ultimate Debian Database">UDD</acronym> to
expose as much useful information as possible about a maintainer’s packages.
The Debian Maintainer Dashboard is in its early days and is waiting for contributors.
<br />
In related news, UDD has been
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2012/06/msg00085.html">migrated to
ullmann</a>,
one of the new machines recently set up by DSA.
