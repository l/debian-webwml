<toc-add-entry name="dilanguage">Help your language reach 100% support in
the Debian Installer</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Christian Perrier recently sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2012/11/msg00036.html">message
to the Debian translators mailing list</a> looking for people
interested in translating the Debian installer into the following
languages: Lithuanian, Bosnian, Tamil, Lao, Hungarian, Icelandic, Macedonian,
Dzongkha, Nepali, Norwegian Nynorsk, Albanian, Amharic, Kurdish, Tagalog,
Wolof (which is currently disabled because too many important strings are
missing) and Tibetan. These languages are almost complete, but the
regular contributors have not responded to the usual calls. Currently 55
out of 70 supported languages have reached 100% completion, the highest
number ever.

<p>
Cyril Brulebois <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20121122">announced
the fourth beta release of the installer for Debian 7.0</a>. This release
features, among other things, many updates to the Linux kernel as well as 
some major improvements in the netcfg package, which is the tool used to
configure the network during the installation. As usual, the Debian
Installer team asks users to test this new release: installer
CDs, other media and everything you might need to install Debian on one of the
thirteen architectures supported are available from the 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">web site</a>.
