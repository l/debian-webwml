<toc-add-entry name="pointrelease">Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.4 released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The fourth <a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120128">update for
Debian 6.0 (codenamed <q>Squeeze</q>)</a> has been released. This update
mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="bitsRT">Bits from the Release Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Niels Thykier sent some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00009.html">bits
from the Release Team</a> where he announced various bits of news:
the addition of armhf and s390x to testing (though these architectures may
be temporarily out of sync with the others), the acceptance of a new
release goal (<q>security hardening build flags</q>), and the completion of
more than fourteen transitions to testing (including GNOME 3, Perl 5.14,
Python 2.7, etc.). Niels also issued a reminder that the freeze is due in
June, even if an exact freeze date has not been selected.
</p>
<p> 
In addition, Niels announced that Cyril Brulebois joined the Release
Team, becoming Release Assistant: congratulations Cyril!
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="bitspiuparts">Bits from the piuparts maintainers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Holger Levsen sent some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00007.html">bits
from the piuparts maintainers</a> announcing that piuparts is again
maintained by a team and they're receiving various patches and other
contributions.
piuparts is an important tool
for Quality Assurance within Debian as it runs various tests in order to
verify that packages can be installed, upgraded and removed without
problems. Tests results are publicly available on the <a
href="http://piuparts.debian.org">piuparts website</a>, where they are
updated on a daily basis. 
Holger urged maintainers to regularly check their personal status pages
on piuparts in order to fix issues related to their packages.
In addition to their regular tests, since December 2011,
the piuparts maintainers have been testing the <a
href="http://piuparts.debian.org/squeeze2wheezy/">upgrade of
individual packages from <q>Squeeze</q> to <q>Wheezy</q></a>: 158
packages failed the test (and another 130 failed it due to dependencies)
while 33,708 passed it.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="med">Report from Debian Med sprint</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Andreas Tille sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2012/01/msg00452.html">report
from the Debian Med sprint</a> held in Southport, UK on 27-29 January.
Among other activities, the Debian Med team fixed some bugs, mentored
new members and students (consolidating the effort
made via the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/MoM"><q>Mentoring of
the Month</q> initiative</a>) and packaged new software.
<br />
For more information on Debian Med activity, you can check their <a

<toc-add-entry name="debianedu">Setting up a new school with Debian Edu/Squeeze</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Petter Reinholdtsen announced on his blog that
the next version of Debian Edu/Squeeze
will contain a <a
href=http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Setting_up_a_new_school_with_Debian_Edu_Squeeze.html>new
tool, called sitesummary2ldapdhcp</a>, which allows all the computers of a school
to be quickly set up with a minimal number of manual steps.
Once the central server is installed, this tool collects data from the network
to generate system objects in the LDAP database. After a few modifications of
the configuration from a GUI, the network of computers is ready to use.
<br />
A third beta version of Debian Edu based on <q>Squeeze</q> and containing this tool has just been released.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="questions">Answering Debian users' questions</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Raphaël Hertzog wrote a useful blogpost about <a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/01/24/answering-questions-of-debian-users-on-various-support-channels/">how
to answer the questions of Debian users</a> and, in general, how to support
new users. There are many places for helping users (<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/users.html#debian-user">mailing lists</a>,
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/IRC">IRC channels</a>, <a
href="http://ask.debian.net">questions &amp; answers websites</a>, etc.) each
with different characteristics, but the golden rule for every support channel is to
be respectful and courteous (as stated in the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/">Debian Community
Guidelines</a>).

<toc-add-entry name="gamesparty">Debian/Ubuntu games screenshot party</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Paul Wise announced a <a 
href="http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/02/03/debian-ubuntu-games-screenshot-party/">Debian/Ubuntu
games screenshot party</a> to be held on 25 and 26 February and
organised by the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Games/Team">Games
Team</a>. The idea is to create screenshots for as many games in
Debian/Ubuntu as possible and upload them to <a
href="http://screenshots.debian.net/">screenshots.debian.net</a> in order
to have them available to <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/goplay">goplay</a> (a games package browser).

<toc-add-entry name="GNOME">GNOME Shell 3.2 in <q>Wheezy</q>: a retrospective</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Jordi Mallach wrote an article on the <a
href="http://oskuro.net/blog/freesoftware/gnome-shell-3.2-in-wheezy-2012-01-31-01-23">\
transition from GNOME 2 to GNOME 3 in Debian</a> from the Debian GNOME
Team point of view. <q>When you’re dealing with dozens of GNOME source
packages at the same time, many of which introduce new libraries, or
worse, introduce incompatible APIs that affect many more unrelated
packages, things get hairy, and you need a plan</q> Jordi said. But even
with a plan for a smooth transition, they encountered a lot of
difficulties, such as failures to build from source on various
architectures and incompatibilities with
other packages. Finally GNOME Shell 3.2 has transitioned to Debian's
testing suite and Jordi thanks not only all Debian GNOME Team members,
but also Release Team members Julien Cristau and Cyril Brulebois and
FTP assistant Luca Falavigna, who helped in reaching this goal.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="interviews">Interviews</toc-add-entry>

	<p>There has been a
<q>People behind Debian</q> interview with
<a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/01/27/people-behind-debian-josselin-mouette-founder-of-the-debian-gnome-team/">Josselin
Mouette</a>, founder of the Debian GNOME team.

</p>

<p>Didier Raboud announced the birth of a <a

new mailing list dedicated to everyone interested in discussing mobile
inferfaces in Debian</a>. The <a

<p>
Micheal Gilbert wrote an <a
href="https://lwn.net/Articles/477062/">article on a recent
security flaw</a> (<a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0064">\
CVE-2012-0064</a>) and how it was handled by
distributions. Thanks also to the detailed
research by the discoverer of the issue, Debian reacted really
fast and the issue was already fixed in Debian unstable less than six
hours after the disclosure.
</p>

<p>
Andrew Pollock wrote some <a
href="http://blog.andrew.net.au/2012/01/21">bits from the ISC DHCP
Maintainer</a>: during a meeting with upstream, he gave them an overview
of his packages on Debian advocating GNU/Hurd patches. A nice example of
good distribution maintainer practices.

<p>
Ben Hutchings announced that <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00012.html">Debian

href="http://liorkaplan.wordpress.com/2012/01/22/php-5-4-debian/">PHP 5.4.0</a>

Lior worked in particular on PHP extensions in order to make them compatible with PHP 5.4.
