<p>
Cyril Brulebois 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/News/2012/20121018">announced
the third beta release of the Debian Installer 7.0</a>.
One of the major improvements in this version of the Debian Installer is
EFI support for 64-bit PCs, which allows installation in EFI mode
instead of using the legacy BIOS. This is a first step towards
full support for UEFI Secure Boot, which is not yet present.
Another interesting new feature in the installer is full IPv6 support
during the installation process.
You can check the 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/errata">errata</a> for
details and a full list of known issues.

<p>
Arno Töll, <tt>mentors.debian.net</tt> maintainer, drafted an initial
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/09/msg00654.html">proposal</a>
last month for a simple procedure for salvaging unmaintained packages.
After some discussion, Lucas Nussbaum, QA team member, put forward an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/10/msg00469.html">updated proposal</a>
for allowing contributors to orphan an unmaintained package, and make it easy
to adopt the package after this first step.
While the discussion is still ongoing, Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader, is
confident that a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/10/msg00575.html">consensus</a>
will emerge from it.
