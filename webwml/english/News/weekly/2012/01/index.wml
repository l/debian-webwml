<toc-add-entry name="DPL">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli sent some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00001.html">bits
from the DPL</a> in which he reported about the work done by Martin

<toc-add-entry name="xserver">Forthcoming new release of the X server</toc-add-entry>

<p>Cyril Brulebois blogged about the <a
href="http://blog.mraw.org/2012/01/01/XServer_1.12RC1/">forthcoming
X server release 1.12</a>: one major change is the addition of
XI2.2 patches, which are related to multitouch support. Another
significant change is the addition of support for Intel's Sandy Bridge New
Acceleration in the Debian packages.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="pnas">Scientific article on Debian in PNAS</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Michael Hanke <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/12/msg00000.html">noted</a>
that the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (<q>PNAS</q>) of the United
States of America has a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/11/14/1115960108.abstract">\
paper on the evolution of software in Debian</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="infographic">New Debian Infographic</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Claudio Filho has published a beautiful <a
href="http://claudiocomputing.wordpress.com/infographic-of-debian/">infographic
about Debian</a>. The main motivation was, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2011/12/msg00066.html">as
Claudio said</a>, <q>to "draw" for final users how Debian can be good for
them</q>. 
<br />
Similar efforts have been made by <a
href="http://ascendances.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/timeline_debian_1993_20111.png">Stéphane Blondon</a> and
<a href="http://chris-lamb.co.uk/2008/03/09/timeline-of-the-debian-project/">Chris
Lamb</a>, who created the <a href="http://timeline.debian.net/">Debian
Timeline website</a> and the related <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/sid/debian-timeline">Debian package</a>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="debtags">New interface for Debtags website</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Enrico Zini announced a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/01/msg00000.html">\
new interface for the Debtags website</a>. Debtags is a project to
classify Debian packages by adding tags to them: <q>Debtags attaches
categories (we call them tags) to packages, creating a new set of useful
structured metadata that can be used to implement more advanced ways of
presenting, searching, maintaining and navigating the package
archive</q>, Enrico said <a
href="http://debtags.alioth.debian.org/paper-debtags.html">while presenting the project in 2005</a>.
Using the new interface, it is possible to <a
href="http://debtags.debian.net/search/">search packages</a>, take a look
at <a href="http://debtags.debian.net/statistics/">statistics about
Debtags</a> and, obviously, <a
href="http://debtags.debian.net/getting-started/">help with the tagging
effort</a>. For more information about Debtags, you can visit the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debtags">related wiki page</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="defoma">apt-get purge defoma</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Paul Wise reported that <a
href="http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/log/2012/01/07/apt-get-purge-defoma/">the
transition from defoma to fontconfig is finally complete</a>. Defoma is
the Debian-specific font manager, long unmaintained, while the
replacement (fontconfig) is cross-distribution and also has wide support
from upstreams. In the past three years the <a
href="http://pkg-fonts.alioth.debian.org/">Debian Fonts Task Force</a>
has worked a lot in order to gain this result, thanks especially to the
work of Christian Perrier and Paul Wise. Please note that the transition
is not completely smooth: <q>Xorg does not yet support fontconfig so for
now programs relying on server-side fonts will only be able to use the
<tt>xfonts-</tt> packages shipping their fonts in the directories known
by the X server</q> and in addition <q>there are some <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/gs-undefoma">issues</a> with Ghostscript and
CJK</q>, Paul said.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="interviews">Further interviews</toc-add-entry>

	<p>Since the last issue of the Debian Project News, 
two new issues of the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian"><q>This week in
	Debian</q> podcast</a> have been published:  with
<a href="http://frostbitemedia.org/node/35">Jonathan Nadeau</a>,
about the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest; and with
<a href="http://frostbitemedia.org/node/31">Raphaël Hertzog</a>,
about the Debian handbook.
</p>

	<p>There has also been a
 <q>People behind Debian</q> interview with
<a href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/12/13/people-behind-debian-ben-hutchings-member-of-the-kernel-team/">Ben
Hutchings</a>, member of the kernel team.
</p>

<p>
In addition the <a href="http://neuro.debian.net/">NeuroDebian team</a> was
<a href="http://incf.org/newsroom/stories/neurodebian-the-value-of-an-integrated-tool-suite">interviewed</a>
by the <acronym lang="en" title="International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility">INCF</acronym>.

howto on using OpenVPN on Debian GNU/Linux</a>.</p>

<p>
Jonas Smedegaard reported that <a
href="http://aceh.tribunnews.com/2011/12/11/ayo-jadi-hacker">the
Indonesian newspaper <q>Serambi</q> dedicated an article to his
Debian involvement</a> after his presence at a radio talkshow in Aceh,
Indonesia. Jonas was travelling Asia in order to deliver a series of talks
dedicated to <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends">Debian Pure Blends</a>. 
More information about his trip are available on a related <a
href="http://wiki.jones.dk/DebianAsia2011">wiki page</a>.
</p>

<p>
The web team is pleased to announce that <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=567781">all
languages have finished their migration to UTF-8</a>, so the <a
href="$(HOME)">Debian website</a> is now available for everyone
in UTF-8, thanks to all the translators who worked on this issue.

<p>
Asheesh Laroia wrote an <a
href="http://www.asheesh.org/note/debian/short-key-ids-are-bad-news.html">interesting
article about short key IDs with OpenPGP and GNU Privacy Guard</a>,
arguing that using them is fundamentally insecure as it's easy to
generate collisions for short key IDs.
</p>

<p>The Debian Project was mentioned in an article by Bruce Byfield on
Datamation titled <a
href="http://www.datamation.com/open-source/2011-the-year-of-linux-disappointments-1.html"><q>2011:
The Year of Linux Disappointments</q></a>. According to the author, in
fact, while various Open Source projects saw a decline in 2011, the
Debian project <q>spent much of 2011 reinventing itself. In the past few
twelve months, it has — among other things — tried to encourage
cooperation among its derivatives, revamped its new member process, and
experimented with IRC training sessions.</q>
</p>

<p>
Martin Zobel-Helas announced that <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2012/01/msg00040.html">he has
applied the main theme of Debian website to db.debian.org, the
internal LDAP directory of Debian Developers</a>. In the previous days, thanks
to Cristoph Berg, the <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">Debian Quality
Assurance website</a> had also switched to the main theme.

<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

	<p>According to the <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search
        interface of the Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 7.0 <q>Wheezy</q>, is currently affected by
797 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
532 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
	release to happen.</p>

	<p>There are also <a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/rc-stats/7.0-wheezy/2012-01">more detailed
	statistics</a> as well as some <a
	href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProjectNews/RC-Stats">hints on how to
	interpret</a> these numbers.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="l10n">Status of Debian Installer localisation</toc-add-entry>

<p>
In his last report on <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/01/05#di-l10n-update-2012-03">\
Debian Installer localisation</a>, Christian Perrier noted that
eighteen languages are currently up to date for D-I's core files;
ten (Czech, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Kazakh, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian and Slovak)
are 100% complete for the moment.
</p>

<p>
Christian informed us <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/01/02#di-l10n-update-2012-02">previously</a>
that <q>A very important and critical fix to
partman-zfs broke a string in sublevel 4.</q>
That explains why the results are lower than the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2011/14/#di">last time</a> we relayed the
translation status, but translators are quickly working to make
the Debian Installer completely available in many languages.
