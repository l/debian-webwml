<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Debian project leader elected</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The Debian project has just reelected <a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120415">Stefano Zacchiroli
for a third year as Debian Project Leader</a>.  More than 80% of voters 
put him as their first choice (or equal first) on their ballot papers.
</p>

<p>
Stefano's large majority over his opponents shows how satisfied the Debian project is
with his work so far, and its wish for him to represent the project during one last
term — Stefano has already announced he won't be seeking reelection again next year.

Wouter Verhelst and Gergely Nagy also gained a lot of support from
Debian project members, both coming hundreds of votes ahead of the
"None of the above" ballot choice.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dc12">Registration open for DebConf12</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The Debian project is pleased to announce that 
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120412">registration is now open for the
DebConf12</a> conference, which will take place in Managua, Nicaragua, from Sunday 8
July to Saturday 14 July 2012.
The conference will be preceded as usual by a week-long DebCamp, from
Sunday 1 July to Saturday 7 July.
It will only be possible to apply for food and accommodation grants
and/or travel grants until 15 May.
</p>
<p>
Debian also invites 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/04/msg00002.html">submissions
of proposals</a> for papers, presentations, discussion sessions
and tutorials for DebConf12 until 1 June 2012.

<toc-add-entry name="permanentBSP">Personal BSP initiatives</toc-add-entry>
<p>
We usually give information about BSPs where a group of people meet over a weekend,
but today we'd like to mention two personal initiatives.  Gregor Herrmann has reported

bug addicts who are constantly helping to make our distribution better.

<toc-add-entry name="s390x">The state of Debian s390x</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Philipp Kern posted an update on the <a href="http://debblog.philkern.de/2012/04/state-of-debian-s390x.html">current
state of the Debian s390x port</a>. Work started on this port <a
href="http://blog.aurel32.net/59">last summer, during
DebConf11</a>, and in less than a month it already had almost 65% of
packages built. Unfortunately, a new GLib release created some problems
on this architecture; but recently a <a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/g/glib2.0/news/20120330T073522Z.html">new
major release of GLib</a> fixed all the issues. The next steps for
this port will be to fix <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?tag=s390x;users=debian-s390@lists.debian.org">open
bugs</a> and to make Iceweasel build successfully.

<p>Guido Günther sent out some
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/04/msg00000.html">bits
from the fifth Debian Groupware Meeting</a>,
which was held at the Linux Hotel in Essen, Germany.
During the weekend the group fixed various issues and was able to
push new versions of <a href="https://packages.debian.org/icedove">icedove</a>
and <a href="https://packages.debian.org/d-push">d-push</a> to <q>unstable</q>
while <a href="https://packages.debian.org/iceowl">iceowl</a> (dead upstream)
remains in <q>experimental</q>.
Some work was also done on OpenChange, Zarafa ZCP and SOGo, and several
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=evolution;dist=unstable">evolution
bugs</a> were worked on.
</p>

<p>
Michael Larabel did some benchmarks <a
href="http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTA4NTY">to compare
Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD/PC-BSD
9.0</a> on a dual AMD Opteron 2384 system with 4 GB
of RAM and a 160 GB Western Digital SATA drive. 
It appears that Linux is generally 
faster than kFreeBSD for now, but kFreeBSD won on a few tests.
For more details, you can
consult the <a href="http://openbenchmarking.org/result/1202215-BY-FREEBSD9683">complete results page</a>.
