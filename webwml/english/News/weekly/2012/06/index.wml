<toc-add-entry name="edu">First <q>Squeeze</q>-based Debian Edu released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The first <q>Squeeze</q>-based version of Debian Edu was
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120311">released</a>

Debian Edu (aka <q>Skolelinux</q>) is a Debian Pure
Blend specifically targeted at schools and other educational institutions,
and provides a completely configured school network environment out of
the box.

Petter Reinholdtsen started a series of blogposts dedicated to Debian Edu
/ Skolelinux, which will include
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Nigel_Barker.html">interviews
with Debian Edu users and administrators</a> and
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Writing_and_translating_documentation_in_Debian_Edu.html">explanations of the team's workflows</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="kernel">The Debian Kernel Team rocks!</toc-add-entry>

<p>
In a recent article, Stefano Zacchiroli pointed out how much 
<a href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2012/03/debian_contributions_to_the_linux_kernel/">the
Debian Kernel Team is contributing to upstream</a>.
Not only can members of the team often be spotted among the most active
contributors to specific Linux releases, but they were
<a href="http://www.kroah.com/log/linux/2.6.32-stable.html">also publicly
thanked by Greg Kroah-Hartman</a>, current Linux kernel maintainer for the
-stable branch, with these words:
<q>I would personally like to thank the Debian kernel developers,
specifically Ben Hutchings, Maximilian Attems, Dann Frazier, Bastian
Blank, and Moritz Muehlenhoff. They went above and beyond what any
<q>normal</q> developer would have done, ferreting patches out of the
kernel.org releases and the different vendor kernels and bug tracking
systems, backporting them to the 2.6.32 kernel, testing, and then
forwarding them on to me. Their dedication to their user community is
amazing for such a <q>volunteer</q> group of developers.
I firmly believe that without their help, the 2.6.32 kernel would not
have been the success that it was. The users of Red Hat and SuSE products
owe them a great debt.</q>
