<toc-add-entry name="ftpteam">Bits from the FTP Team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Joerg Jaspert sent some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00001.html">bits
from the FTP Team</a>, announcing the ongoing sprint
during which the team is working on optimising the current code behind
the main archive, finalising a proposal for Debian Personal
Package Archives (PPAs), and merging backports.debian.org into the main
archive host.
This year, participation in the Google Summer of Code initiative
helped the team in implementing a true multi-archive capability, making
it possible to merge separated parts of the Debian archive (like security
and backports) into the main archive.
Joerg also added a call for volunteers: if you are a Debian Developer and
want to help one of the key teams of the Debian infrastructure, please
consider joining them.
