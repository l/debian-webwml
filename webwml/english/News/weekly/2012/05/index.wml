<toc-add-entry name="clang-rebuild">Rebuild of the Debian archive with clang</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Sylvestre Ledru performed a 
<a href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2012/02/29/rebuild_of_the_debian_archive_with_clang">study
that rebuilt the Debian archive using clang</a>, a new C/C++/Objective-C compiler.
The goal was to evaluate the current capabilities of clang for
compilation and C/C++/Objective-C support. Results are available
on the <a href="http://clang.debian.net/">Debian clang web pages</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="debian-peru">Debian Peru revival</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Rudy Godoy blogged about a 
<a href="http://blog.stone-head.org/debianperu/">revival of the Debian
Peru local group</a>. The Debian Peru users group was founded in 2004 and
was quite active in spreading the word about Debian and Free Software,
but then slowed down its activity. However, in the two last weeks, the
group has become active again and they're planning various events
and meetings aimed at helping people to contribute to Debian.
You can find more information in the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPeru">group wiki page</a> or on
their <a href="http://listas.apesol.org/listinfo.cgi/debian-apesol.org">mailing
list</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="dc11report">DebConf11 final report is out</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The DebConf organisation team released the final report of the 2011
Debian Conference, which was held in Banja Luka, Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The report can be downloaded from the 
<a href="http://media.debconf.org/dc11/report/">DebConf media
website</a>.

<br />
In related news, the DebConf committee decided that DebConf13
<a href="http://www.debian.org/News/2012/20120301">will take place in
Switzerland</a>, likely in the middle of August. The Swiss bid narrowly
won over the bid from Riga, Latvia.

<toc-add-entry name="debutsav">Debian Utsav</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Shirish Agarwal reported on the
<a href="https://flossexperiences.wordpress.com/2012/02/08/debian-utsav-coep-04-02-2012/">Debian
Utsav</a> which took place in Pune last month. <q>Debian Utsav is
celebration of Debian folks — meet at one place, eat,
drink and work on Debian!</q> as Praveen — one of the
main organisers — explained in an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-dug-in/2012/01/msg00003.html">announcement
message</a>.
During the meeting there were some interesting talks and workshops, such as
<q>Debian history</q>, <q>What goes on in making Debian</q> and
<q>Introducing to packaging</q>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>The 29th issue of the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/03/msg00000.html">miscellaneous news for developers</a> 
has been released and covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>New Iceweasel add-on to help looking up developer sites</li>
  <li>Realtime collaborative text editing services for Debian</li>
  <li>DEP9: Availability of reconf-inetd (replacement for update-inetd)</li>

<p>
Sylvestre Ledru wrote a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2012/03/msg00000.html">report
from the Parisian bug squashing party</a> at IRILL's offices.
104 bugs were fixed.
One of the key achievements of this BSP was that Cyril Brulebois fixed
the last few packages that had been still using the Yada packaging tool.
</p>

<p>
Leandro Gómez sent out a 
<a href="http://leogg.wordpress.com/2012/02/26/debconf-needs-you/">call
for volunteers for DebConf12</a> on his blog. Leandro explained how
DebConf brings a lot of benefits to the Debian project: during the
conference, Debian contributors can share knowledge and have
discussions in order to improve various aspects of Debian, including
packages, translations, and the infrastructure.
