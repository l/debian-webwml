<toc-add-entry name="pointrelease">Update for Debian 6.0: 6.0.6 released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The sixth <a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20120929">update for
Debian 6.0 (codenamed <q>Squeeze</q>)</a> has been released. This update
mainly adds corrections of security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="BSP">Reports from the latest BSPs</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="http://beta.howtorecognise.mine.nu/blog/Dublin_BSP.html">bug
squashing party held in Dublin</a> on Saturday, 8 September
was hosted in Google office space and gathered 15 people.
In addition to its impact on the Release-Critical bugs list it triggered
the bootstrapping of a local Debian community with the desire to
hold a second such party in October. 
</p>

<p>
The following weekend, another
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/2012/09/msg00008.html">bug
squashing party held in Berlin</a> gathered approximately 25 people who also
worked on German translations besides dealing with Release-Critical bugs.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="gsoc">Results from Debian's Google Summer of Code</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Ana Guerrero sent a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/09/msg00011.html">report
about Debian's Google Summer of Code</a>. Debian has been participating in the
Google Summer of Code since 2006, and sponsored 15 projects this year, of which 12
finished successfully.

Students supervised by Debian mentors worked on various aspects of the
project, including improvements to mentors.debian.net, the development
of multi-arch cross-toolchains, and metrics for team activities, to
name just three. Some of these results have already been included into Debian.

The Debian project thanks those who took part, including especially the
students for their contributions, and invites them to continue being involved
in making Debian better.
