<toc-add-entry name="rmll">Debian's presence at RMLL 2012</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The yearly Libre Software Meeting, better known
by its French name <a href="http://2012.rmll.info/">Rencontres Mondiales du
Logiciel Libre (RMLL)</a>, took place in Geneva, Switzerland, from 7 to
12 July; Anne Forker
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2012/08/msg00041.html">sent a report</a>
about the Debian presence there, completing the
<a href="http://debianmed.blogspot.de/2012/07/debian-med-bits-report-from-lsm-geneva.html">report</a>
by Andreas Tille mentioned in a
<a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2012/15/#med">previous issue</a>.

The Debian project was well represented with a booth, four lectures and a
workshop. At the booth, T-shirts, umbrellas, Swiss army knives and other
goodies could be purchased. The booth was also a meeting point for fans and
contributors of Debian, a place to discuss computer issues and for socialisation 
between conference attendees.

Some pictures of the event taken by Marc <q>Duck</q> Dequènes are available on his
<a href="https://photos.duckcorp.org/v/users/duck/GeekAttitude/20120707_RMLL/RMLL/">website</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="64-bit PC">64-bit PC: primary Debian architecture</toc-add-entry>

<p>
According to the <a href="http://popcon.debian.org">Debian Popularity
Contest</a>, 64-bit PC is now the primary architecture in terms of number of
submissions via the popularity-contest package, which periodically and
anonymously sends statistics about the usage of installed packages.

With a bit more than 60,000 submissions, 64-bit PC just overtook 32-bit PC. These
leading architectures are followed by armel and powerpc, for which the number of
submissions is several orders of magnitude behind.

<toc-add-entry name="mirrors">New mirrors closer to Debian users</toc-add-entry>                      
                                                                                                                
<p>The Debian mirrors team, together with our sponsors, is happy to announce three
new mirrors: in <a href="http://ftp.ru.debian.org/debian/">Russia</a>, provided
by the <a href="http://mephi.ru/">National Research Nuclear University
<q>MEPhI</q></a> whose administrators are <q>pleased to provide a full Debian mirror
to Russian users</q>; in <a href="http://mirror.debian.vn/debian/">Vietnam</a>,
provided by MAYCHU; and in <a href="http://archive.mmu.edu.my/debian/">Malaysia</a>,
provided by the <a href="http://www.mmu.edu.my/">Multimedia University of Malaysia</a>.
                                                                                                                
For other countries, the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">full list of mirrors</a>
is available online, as well as the <a
href="http://http.debian.net/">experimental redirector</a> which will
automatically take into account these new mirrors.
There are still countries lacking good connectivity to a Debian mirror;
sponsors interested in hosting are invited to <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/submit">contact the mirrors team</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="thesis">Debian translation workflows in a Master's thesis</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Laura Arjona recently defended her
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2012/06/msg00110.html">Master's degree thesis</a>
entitled <q>Translations in
libre software</q>. Many aspects of Debian are included,
such as a case study about translation projects and teams in Debian;
another one about <q>The Debian Administration Handbook</q>; and an interview
with Javier Taravilla, a member of the l10n-spanish (Spanish localisation) team.
<q>The more I see of the Debian community, the more I like it and it amazes
me</q>, she said when she announced <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-spanish/2012/06/msg00320.html">\
her project</a> to the Debian mailing list.

Laura started to contribute to the spam cleaning efforts, and she plans to help
in the l10n-spanish team soon. 

The manuscript of her thesis as well as the slides are available from her
<a href="http://larjona.wordpress.com/2012/06/25/presentation-of-my-master-thesis-translations-in-libre-software/">blog</a>.
