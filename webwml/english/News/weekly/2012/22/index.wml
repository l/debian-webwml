<toc-add-entry name="codesearch">Code search engine for Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Michael Stapelberg announced the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/11/msg00001.html">\
birth of Debian Code Search</a>, a search engine for source code
within Debian.
<q>It allows you to search all ≈ 17000 source packages,
containing 130 GiB of FLOSS source code (including Debian
packaging) with regular expressions</q>, explained Michael.
The <a href="http://codesearch.debian.net/">search engine</a>
is already available for use.

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli sent his 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/11/msg00000.html">monthly
report of DPL activities for October</a>: among other things, Stefano
reported the boost of activity in the recently created <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cloud/">debian-cloud mailing
list</a>. This new mailing list is dedicated to discussions of the
development and use of Debian on public and private clouds, such as for
instance the ongoing discussion about the integration of Debian
on popular clouds like Windows Azure or the Amazon Web Services Marketplace.

<p>
Neil McGovern sent an 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2012/11/msg00003.html">update
on the state of the <q>Wheezy</q> freeze</a>, explaining that
the Release Team is now particularly focused on managing unblock
requests (where these comply with the
<a href="https://release.debian.org/wheezy/freeze_policy.html">freeze
policy</a>) and removing buggy leaf packages.
Meanwhile, the Release Critical bug count is decreasing, thanks also to the
great number of Bug Squashing Parties held during recent months.
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2012/20121110">More Debian Bug Squashing Parties</a>
are scheduled for the upcoming
weeks: you can help Debian to release sooner by participating!

<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>
<p>
According to the <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search
interface of the Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
Debian <q>Wheezy</q>, is currently affected by 425 Release-Critical bugs.

Ignoring bugs which are easily solved or on the way to being solved,
roughly speaking, about 220 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved
for the release to happen.
