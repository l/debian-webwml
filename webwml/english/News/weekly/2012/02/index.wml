<p>Welcome to this year's second issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="w3techs">Debian ahead on web servers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
According to a <a
href="http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/debian_is_now_the_most_popular_linux_distribution_on_web_servers">\
recent W3Techs survey</a>, Debian has just surpassed CentOS to become the
most popular GNU/Linux distribution on web servers.
The survey is based on the analysis of the top million web sites
according to Alexa, in order to select a representative sample of
established sites, and focused only on the technologies used for web sites (and
not individual web pages or desktop installations).
In fact, at the beginning of 2012, Debian was used by 29.4% of all
Linux-based sites (and by 9.7% of all web sites), while CentOS was used
by 29.1% of all Linux-based sites (and by 9.5% of all web sites).
Debian <q>is also the fastest growing operating system at the moment: every
day 54 of the top 1 million sites switch to Debian</q>, said Matthias
Gelbmann in the article.
With regard to the geographical distribution of web sites using Debian, the
most are in Europe (with 39.7% of all sites in Germany, 36.1% in
Poland, 33.6% in France and 26.4% in Russia).

<toc-add-entry name="dummy">Dummy web server in Debian?</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Thomas Goirand recently proposed to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2012/01/msg00148.html">\
relax or even remove some dependencies</a> of web applications on a
web server package.
This would help users wanting to install such web applications in chroots,
while the web server is installed only outside the chroot.
During the following discussion, several solutions were proposed,
such as providing a dummy web server package in Debian. It was
pointed out that such dummy packages are actually very easy to create
with the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/equivs">equivs</a> package,
which deserves to be better known.

<toc-add-entry name="aptitude">Aptitude strikes back</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Christian Perrier blogged about the <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2012/01/14#aptitude-revival">\
recent revival of the aptitude package manager</a>. As the main
maintainer had less time to dedicate to it, the number of bugs
against aptitude was continually growing and reached more than 800.
But last November, Daniel Harwig and Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo
started working on it, triaging bugs and preparing a possible new
version.
If you want to help them, join the <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/aptitude-devel">aptitude-devel</a>
mailing list on Alioth.

<toc-add-entry name="donations-fu">About donations to Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli blogged about <a
href="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/blog/posts/2012/01/debian_donations-fu/">how
donations to Debian are used by the project</a>. First of all, Stefano
explained how money is used in the Debian Project: to buy hardware and
hardware-related services for Debian infrastructure, to sponsor
contributor sprints, or to support travel expenses in order to allow
Debian Developers to represent Debian at conferences and meetings.
Then, Stefano noted that almost all donations to Debian come from private
citizens and not from big corporate sponsors: corporates mostly sponsor
DebConf (the Debian annual conference).
At the end, Stefano pointed out that it's possible to check
how Debian spends donated money: by reading the <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/meetings/minutes/">minutes of SPI monthly
meetings</a> or the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Sprints">list
of sprints</a>, visiting the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DPL">DPL wiki page</a> and consulting
the <a href="http://media.debconf.org/">DebConf reports</a>. Stefano also
added that over the next month he will be working to further improve the
transparency of Debian's budget.
</p>

<p>
On the subject of Debian's usage of money, Yves-Alexis Perez proposed to
<a href="http://www.corsac.net/?rub=blog&amp;post=1541">\
advocate hardware sponsoring</a>.
Since asking for money for oneself is not always the first reflex, he proposed to
turn the offer the other way around: if you believe that a Debian Developer
could use some money for hardware purposes, you should raise your voice and
propose it yourself, in case the developer was too shy to ask, for example.

<toc-add-entry name="armhf">Armhf status in Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve McIntyre blogged about <a
href="http://blog.einval.com/2012/01/09">the status of the armhf port in
Debian</a>. Since mid-2011, he has been working on armhf as a new
architecture in <q>debian-ports</q>; then in December it was imported into the main Debian
archive. The current state of auto-building can be viewed at the <a
href="https://buildd.debian.org/status/architecture.php?a=armhf&amp;suite=sid">armhf
buildd status page</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="IGMP">IGMP denial of service in Linux</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Ben Hutchings wrote an interesting report on <a
href="http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/igmp-denial-of-service-in-linux-cve-2012-0207.html">a
security issue in Linux</a> found by himself while working on <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/654876">bug #654876</a>. As his laptop
running Linux 3.0 or 3.1 crashed repeatedly, Simon McVittie — the bug
submitter — thought it could be a driver bug. But, analysing the log of
the crash, Ben noted that <q>a packet received through the wireless
interface was being processed by IGMP, which then divided by zero.</q>
IGMP packets are used to support multicast routers: as Ben explained,
<q>every multicast address corresponds to a dynamic set of hosts, called
a multicast group</q>. In order to know which hosts belong to which groups,
the router sends packets and the computer replies at intervals. There are
three different versions of the IGMP protocol used to define the Maximum
Response Time (MRT) of the computer. Ben found that the crash was caused
by a division by 0 of packets with an MRT of 0.
The patch is included in Linux 3.0.17, 3.1.9, 3.2.1, and the Debian
packaged version 3.1.8-2.
<br />
Well done, Ben!

<toc-add-entry name="interviews">Interviews</toc-add-entry>

	<p>There has been one
 <q>People behind Debian</q> interview: with
<a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2012/01/13/people-behind-debian-steve-mcintyre-debian-cd-maintainer-former-debian-project-leader/">Steve
McIntyre</a> (Debian CD maintainer and former Debian Project Leader).

<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>


<p>
Gerfried Fuchs wrote an interesting article about a <a
href="http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/2012/01/19">Release Critical
bug-squashing effort for Stable</a>. Stable RC bugs are often not noted, as people
usually concentrate on Unstable RC bugs, but - as Gerfried noted - <q>it
is one of our supported releases and thus should receive quite some
attention, at least by the corresponding package maintainers
themself.</q>
</p>

<p>
Enrico Zini announced that <a
href="http://www.enricozini.org/2012/debian/debtags-for-derivatives/">the
Debtags web site also works for derivative distributions</a>: the site now shows
packages from Ubuntu too, and can be extended to all Debian derivatives.

<toc-add-entry name="rcstats">Release-Critical bugs statistics for the upcoming release</toc-add-entry>

	<p>According to the <a href="http://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search
        interface of the Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 7.0 <q>Wheezy</q>, is currently affected by
736 Release-Critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
495 Release-Critical bugs remain to be solved for the
	release to happen.</p>
