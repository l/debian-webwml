<p>Welcome to this year's fifteenth issue of DPN, the newsletter for the

<toc-display/>


<toc-add-entry name="help">Volunteers needed for publicity team</toc-add-entry>

<p>
As you may have noticed, it has been quite some time since the last edition of
Debian Project News. To improve the frequency of
<acronym lang="en" title="Debian Project News" >DPN</acronym> and expand its
other activities, the Debian Publicity team is looking for new contributors.
Did you ever want to help Debian, but every piece of software you were interested
in was already packaged? You don't consider yourself a <q>technical person</q>? You
have basic skills in written English? Perfect! Have you considered
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/11/msg00055.html">joining
the Publicity Team</a>? If you are a Debian member, the Press team is also looking
for new contributors.

<toc-add-entry name="javarm">Removal of sun-java6 from the archive</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The release of Java update 29 from Oracle marks not only security updates,
but a change to the licensing, removing Debian's ability to distribute the
non-free JVM. The clause in the Java license under which we were able to
distribute Java, the <acronym lang="en" title="Operating System Distributor License for Java" >DLJ</acronym>,
has been removed. As a result, the sun-java6 package is no longer suitable
for the archive, and has been removed, as documented in
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/646524" >Debian Bug #646524</a>. Sylvestre Ledru
<a href="http://sylvestre.ledru.info/blog/sylvestre/2011/10/25/removal_of_sun_java6_from_debian" >suggests</a>
that sun-java6 installs be migrated to openjdk, the open-source alternative, using the
following command: <code>apt-get --purge remove sun-java6-jre &amp;&amp; apt-get install openjdk-7-jre</code>.
Kai Wasserbäch has also been pointed out <a href="http://www.carbon-project.org/Removal_of_sun_java6_and_ElsterOnline.html" >elsewhere</a>
that this upgrade path might not be suitable for all Java programs, and special
attention should be paid to re-testing installed Java applications on OpenJDK.

<toc-add-entry name="sdl">Debian SDL packaging team revival</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/DebianSdlGroup">SDL packaging
team</a> has recently been seriously <a href="http://ddumont.wordpress.com/2011/11/19/sdl-team-revival/">revived</a>,
with Dominique Dumont reorganising the team and Manuel A. Fernandez Montecelo
joining the effort. Packaging is progressively moving to Git for easier
collaboration, and developers maintaining SDL-related packages not in the team's
repository have been invited to join, too. A lot of old bugs have already been
fixed and new SDL 1.3 and sdl-perl packages have been uploaded to experimental.
SDL 1.3 brings support for newer OpenGL <acronym lang="en" title="Application
programming interface">APIs</acronym>, input improvements like multi-touch,
gestures and force feedback device support, better Unicode support and support
for multiple windows and displays.

<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli sent his <q>Bits from the <acronym lang="en" title="Debian Project Leader">DPL</acronym></q>
for <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/11/msg00001.html">October</a>
and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/12/msg00000.html">November</a>.
He reminds us that the New Maintainer Process has been renamed as
the New Member Process, and that a list of <q>easy hacks</q> is
a very effective way of attracting contributors to teams.
He notes that Ubuntu plan to deprecate their package review platform
(REVU) in favour of converging on <tt>mentors.debian.net</tt>.
This will need some Debexpo changes and also
more package sponsorship by Debian members.
Stefano has approved funds for the recent DebConf
video team sprint and also hardware replacements for
<tt>lists.debian.org</tt> and <tt>ftp.debian.org</tt>,
which have now arrived and are in the process of being set up by
<acronym lang="en" title="the Debian System Administrators">DSA</acronym>.
He reports that Fathi Boudra represented
Debian at the Software Freedom Day in Algeria.
Stefano also reported on his trademark-related activities, including a contact
point for inquiries related to the Debian trademark, seeking legal advice
on how trademark law applies to Debian packaging activities, and starting a
discussion on the relationships between the <acronym lang="en" title="Debian
Free Software Guidelines">DFSG</acronym> and trademark restrictions.
He is also working on a statement to make explicit the position of the Debian
Project on software patents.
The <acronym lang="en" title="Open Source Initiative">OSI</acronym>
have invited the Debian Project to their upcoming affiliation programme.
There is also work in progress to have the Debian Project become a member of
the forums for <acronym lang="en" title="Internet Systems Consortium">ISC</acronym>
software that we distribute.
Stefano also mentioned his continuing work in creating a discussion forum for
companies that have a strategic interest in Debian.

<toc-add-entry name="ubuapprdeb">Ubuntu appreciates Debian</toc-add-entry>

<p>As part of Ubuntu's recent <a href="http://wiki.ubuntu.com/UCADay">Community
Appreciation Day</a>, Michael Hall sent Debian
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/11/msg00626.html">a message
of appreciation</a>, stating <q>Without you we wouldn't be able to make the
contributions we do. Ubuntu is great because Debian is great, and we appreciate
all of the work that goes into making it that way.</q> Michael
<a href="http://www.jonobacon.org/2011/11/17/welcoming-our-new-horseman-michael-hall/">will 
be joining</a> Canonical's Community Team, focusing on projects that are
upstream for Ubuntu.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="indiamangalore">India mini-DebConf, Mangalore edition</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Christian Perrier <a href="https://lists.debian.org/20111105184310.GD4138@mykerinos.kheops.frmug.org">reported</a>
on his participation in the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianIndia/MiniDebConf2011/MangaloreEdition">mini-DebConf
in Mangalore, south-west India</a>. The conference was held at Nitte MahaLinga
Adyanthaya Memorial Institute of Technology and organised by Vasudev Kamath and
a team of computer-science students from the college with support from staff,
including the college principal, Dr. S. Y. Kulakarni. Christian gave the opening
talk, introducing Debian, how to contribute, and information about Debian
internationalisation and localisation. Later Jonas Smedegaard presented a talk
about Debian Pure Blends, focusing on how distributions derived from Debian can
work inside Debian instead of outside of it. This was part of his
<a href="http://dr.jones.dk/blog/debianasia2011/">trip</a> promoting Debian and
Debian Pure Blends in Asia. The talks were followed on the second day with
sessions on localisation, packaging, OpenPGP keys and contributing to Debian.
The event was publicised in one of the major newspapers in India, namely <q>The
Hindu</q>. Events such as these are vital to local communities. The participation
of <q>international</q> contributors in these events often brings more attention to
them and is highly appreciated by the local community.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="mirror">New mirror in El Salvador</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Debian mirrors team is happy to announce the first mirror in <a
href="http://ftp.sv.debian.org/debian/">El Salvador</a>, sponsored by <a
href="http://www.salud.gob.sv/">the Ministry of Health</a>, with the help of
René Mayorga and Carlos Juan Martín Pérez.
Salvadorian Debian users are invited to update their
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code> in order to use
<code>ftp.sv.debian.org</code>.

To quote Carlos Juan Martín Pérez <q>For us, the Ministry of Health, and as
members of the Salvadorian Community of Free Software, is an honour to belong
to the great Debian family.</q>

For other countries, the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">full list of mirrors</a>
is available online.
There are still many countries lacking good connectivity to a Debian mirror;
sponsors interested in hosting are invited to contact the mirrors team.

<toc-add-entry name="debexpo">Debexpo maintainers call for contributions</toc-add-entry>

<p>Discussing the potential integration of packaging teams into Debexpo, the
software behind the <a href="http://mentors.debian.net/">mentors.debian.net</a>
service, Arno Töll issued a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/4ECD5330.40104@toell.net">call for
contributions</a>, since the current team members are busy.
</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Debexpo">Debexpo</a> is maintained as an
<a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/debexpo/">Alioth project</a>.

<toc-add-entry name="bsp">Bug Squashing Party marathon started</toc-add-entry>

<p>
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathon">Similarly</a>
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathonEtch">to</a>
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathonLenny">previous</a>
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathonSqueeze">releases</a>,
a marathon of Bug Squashing Parties (BSPs) has been started with concurrent BSPs
being held in <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/1202-hildesheim-bsp">Hildesheim</a>,
Germany and <a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2011/1204-ubulocjam-debbsp">Portland</a>,
OR, USA. While the first one concentrated on fixing Release Critical bugs, the
second concentrated on creating multiarch patches for different libraries.
</p>

<p>
Both BSPs were quite successful. In Hildesheim <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/events/bsp-hi-2011-3">60 Release Critical bugs
were addressed</a> and several improvements to the <a
href="http://blog.ganneff.de/blog/2011/12/04/bsp-hildesheim.html">archive
software</a> introduced, while in Portland <a
href="http://web.dodds.net/~vorlon/wiki/blog/Making_jam_from_bugs/">14
multiarch patches</a> were created! They also noted down how to <a
href="http://www.outflux.net/blog/archives/2011/12/05/ec2-instances-in-support-of-a-bsp/">prepare
cloud instances</a> in preparation for Bug Squashing Parties.
</p>

<p>The next Bug Squashing Parties in Mönchengladbach, Germany (January or
February) and Paris, France (17 to 19 February) are <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSPMarathonWheezy">already being organised</a>.
The Debian Wiki has <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HostingBSP">more information
about organising a BSP</a>, should you consider organising your own.</p>

<p>Debian would like to thank <a
href="http://pengutronix.com/index_en.html">Pengutronix</a> (in Hildesheim) and
<a href="http://puppetlabs.com/">Puppet Labs</a> (in Portland) for their support
in organising these two events.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="fosdem-cft">Call for talks: FOSDEM 2012</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Wouter Verhelst sent a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/20111111113115.GZ17352@grep.be">call for talks
for the distribution developers room</a> at the upcoming 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/events/2012/0204-fosdem">FOSDEM 2012</a>, the
Free and Open Source Software Developers' European Meeting.
The FOSDEM takes place in Brussels, Belgium in early February 2012.
Acceptable sessions can be any wide range of things, including talks,
BoF sessions, and round tables. Two cross-distributions devrooms are intended to be
for people from any participating distribution project, and may cover
Debian-specific subjects, or indeed targeted at Debian developers only.

	<p>According to the <a href="https://udd.debian.org/bugs.cgi">Bugs Search
        interface of the Ultimate Debian Database</a>, the upcoming release,
	Debian 7.0 <q>Wheezy</q>, is currently affected by
1005 release-critical bugs. Ignoring bugs which are easily solved
	or on the way to being solved, roughly speaking, about
849 release-critical bugs remain to be solved for the
