<h2>Updated Debian: 6.0.1 released</h2>
<p>
The first <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110319">update for Debian 6.0
(codename <q>Squeeze</q>)</a> has been released.
This update mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with some adjustments for serious problems.
</p>


<a name="2"></a>
<h2>Nicaragua to host DebConf12</h2>
<p>The DebConf committee has announced that DebConf12, the Debian
developer conference for 2012,
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110325">will be held in Managua, Nicaragua</a>.
The Managua bid beat a bid from Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
More details can be found on the <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf12">organizers' wiki</a>.</p>


<a name="3"></a>
<h2>Debian Derivatives Exchange project launched</h2>
<p>Stefano Zacchiroli and Matt Zimmerman launched a new project called the
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110318">Debian dErivatives eXchange project (DEX)</a>.
The main goal of this project is to reduce the technical differences
between Debian and its derivatives. The first such group is the
<a href="http://dex.alioth.debian.org/ubuntu/">Ubuntu DEX Team</a>,
which aims to start integrating packages and changes available in
Ubuntu back into Debian. A gNewSense DEX Team is also expected soon.
</p>

<p>The Debian Project invites all Debian based distributions and other projects to join the
DEX project and work together on a common base.</p>

<a name="4"></a>
<h2>Bits from the Debian Installer Team</h2>

<p>Otavio Salvador sent some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2011/03/msg00403.html">bits from the
Debian Installer Team</a>, which summarizes changes that have happened in
the team since the release of <q>Squeeze</q> (such as the switch from Subversion to Git),
and the team's goals for <q>Wheezy</q> (among others, more features for netcfg:
wireless support for WPA networks, IPv6, VLAN network infrastructure
support, and link detection). 
An important part of the mail is dedicated to a
call for help: the right moment to join the team and start contributing is
exactly now, as it's starting a new development cycle.</p>

<a name="5"></a>
<h2>Insider summary of recent developments in DebConf11 organization</h2>

<p>Vedran Omeragic has blogged about <a
href="http://blog.debconf.org/blog/debconf11/vo_insiderssummary.dc">some
recent developments in DebConf11 organization</a>. The
<a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/">official DebConf11 website</a> has
been completed and contains a lot of information for those wanting to
attend this year's Debian developer conference. Another important step
was made (during a meeting held on 22 February) in establishing <a
href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/sponsorship.xhtml">sponsorship levels</a>,
slightly changed from last year, and completing <a
href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/documentation.xhtml#localdoc">sponsorship
brochures</a>, available in three different qualities. There are also some
clarifications about the Bosnian visa regime: all the information can be found on
<a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf11/Travel-Visa">the related wiki
page</a>. At the end, Vedran lists the next steps: opening registration,
working on finding the best routes for attendees, looking for sponsors,
and preparing promotional material. You can contact the DebConf11
organizational team on their mailing list at <a
href="mailto:debconf11-localteam@lists.debconf.org">debconf11-localteam@lists.debconf.org</a>.</p>

<h2>Debian -offtopic mailing list</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted to discuss things completely unrelated to Debian or even
computers with fellow users or developers? On debian-user the custom is
to put [OT] in the subject and fire away.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this can be disruptive for uninterested subscribers,
especially on a high volume mailing list like debian-user. Because of
this, with the kind support of Holger Levsen and the <a
href="http://www.debian-community.org">Debian Community
project</a>, the <a
href="http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/d-community-offtopic">d-community-offtopic
list</a> has been created.</p>

<p>The list is open to anyone, just like most other Debian lists, so all
you have to do is to CC and set Reply-To to the list, so that whoever is
interested will know discussion is moving to that list. Have fun and be
excellent to each other!</p>

<h2>Further <q>This week in Debian</q> interviews</h2>

	<p>Since the last issue of the Debian Project News, two
 new issues of the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian"><q>This week in
	Debian</q> podcast</a> have been published: with
<a href="http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-22">Joe
Shields</a> of the Debian Mono team; and with <a
href="http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-23">Jonathan
Nadeau</a>, about Debian and the Northeast GNU/Linux Fest.
</p>

<a name="8"></a>
<h2>Other news</h2>

<p>Michael Gilbert announced the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00347.html">first
unofficial Debian monthly <q>testing</q> snapshot release</a>. The release is
currently available as mini ISO images for i386 and amd64 architectures.
</p>

<p>Alexander Reichle-Schmehl noticed that the <a
href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/events/cebit-2011/lnm-award-video-online">\
video of the Linux New Media Award ceremony</a>, in which we can see Alexander
himself and Meike Reichle receive two awards on behalf of the Debian Project,
is finally <a
href="http://www.techcast.com/events/cebit11/do11/">available online</a>.</p>

<p>As reported by Ana Guerrero in her mail, the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00972.html">deadline
for proposing Google Summer of Code (GSoC) projects is close</a>. As
you may know Debian has again this year been accepted as a mentor
organization for the GSoC. The submission of student proposals opened
today, but we are still missing project proposals and mentors: you can
visit <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010#SelectedProjects">last
year's projects page</a> to find some inspiration, or simply think of
an project in your team and propose it.</p>
