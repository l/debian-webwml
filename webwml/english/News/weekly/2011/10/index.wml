<p>
Holger Levsen sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/201106141624.46478.holger@layer-acht.org">\
report from the Debian Edu developer gathering in Hamburg, Germany.</a>
The main goal of the sprint was preparing the release of Debian Edu <q>Squeeze</q>.
Debian Edu developers discussed and worked on various things like documentation,
Samba integration, and testing of <q>Squeeze</q> installation images.
More than 200 commits were pushed to the Debian Edu's Subversion repository and 18 bugs fixed (and a bunch of
bugs filed against <tt>bugs.skolelinux.org</tt>). Participants also had a long discussion with two persons
from <q>Chaos macht Schule</q>, which is a CCC subproject. In the end of his mail Holger thanks
CCC Hamburg, Opensides.be, the OLPC.de association and the Debian sprints
program for their financially supporting the event.

<p>
Christian Perrier noticed that the <a

bug #630000</a> has been reported Friday, 10 Jun 2011.
</p>

<p>
Daniel Barlow blogged about 
<a
href="https://www.debian-administration.org/article/669/Cloning_a_Debian_system_-_identical_packages_and_versions">how
to clone a Debian system</a> installing on it identical packages and
versions.
</p>

<p>
Martin Zobel-Helas wrote an interesting article on <a
href="http://blog.zobel.ftbfs.de/2011/06/how-you-can-help-debian-1.html">how
start contributing to Debian</a>. He listed various ways to help Debian:
from reporting bugs and try to reproduce them, to write documentation or
translate the existing one, to organize events or deliver talk on
Debian-related topics. And, if you haven't time to actively work with
Debian, you could always help it donating money or hardware. As Martin 
said: <q>Find your own area to work on within
Debian, and don't think you can't help. Even graphic designers, lawyers
or clerks can help Debian!</q>.

## Maybe it need some rewrites: the end doesn't sound really ok, to me.
