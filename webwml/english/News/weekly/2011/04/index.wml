<p>Welcome to this year's fourth issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="award">The Debian project wins awards at CeBIT</toc-add-entry>
<p>The Debian project won the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110304">Linux New Media award
in two categories</a> at the recent CeBIT conference in 
Hanover, Germany. Not only was Debian named as the <q>Best Open Source Server
Distribution</q> for its <q>pioneering work</q> both in the technical
field and in the definition of free software standards and processes, but
it also won the prestigious award for <q>Outstanding contribution to Open
Source/Linux/Free Software</q>,
presented by Karsten Gerloff, president of the Free Software Foundation
Europe, who donned a snazzy Debian tie just for the occasion.
</p>

<p>
The <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110307084157.GU15429@melusine.alphascorpii.net">full
text of his speech</a> has been made available, including a short
explanation of why this award is so important: the jury consists of over 300
FLOSS community members, developers, journalists, and companies,
selected through secret ballot. The award is not awarded by
a publisher, but by the representatives of the entire Free Software
Community!</p>


<toc-add-entry name="linux">Debian named the most important GNU/Linux distribution</toc-add-entry>
<p>IT journalist Bruce Byfield published an
<a href="http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3926941/Linux-Leaders-Debian-and-Ubuntu-Derivative-Distros.htm">\
article analyzing in detail the <q>market share</q> and influence
of the Debian distribution</a>. Gathering various data (e.g. the <a
href="http://distrowatch.com/search.php?category=All&amp;origin=All&amp;basedon=All&amp;notbasedon=None&amp;desktop=All&amp;architecture=All&amp;status=Active">number of
active Debian derivatives</a> according to <a
href="http://distrowatch.com/">DistroWatch</a>; 63% of these are directly or indirectly
based upon Debian) he also lists various specialties of Debian and its
derivatives. His conclusion: <q>It's not quite true to say
that, if you can think of a specialty, then there is at least one Debian or
Ubuntu derivative is designed for it. However, it is not much of an
exaggeration, either.</q>  This was also mentioned on <a
href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> under the title <q><a
href="http://linux.slashdot.org/story/11/03/05/013205/Debian-Is-the-Most-Important-Linux">Debian is the
most important Linux</a></q>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="cebit">Report from CeBIT 2011</toc-add-entry>

<p>Alexander Reichle-Schmehl sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.orgt/2011/03/msg00020.html">report</a>
of this year's <a href="http://www.cebit.de/home">CeBIT</a> where he and other Debian Contributors has
represented Debian joining the booth of Univention, a company which bases its
product on Debian. In three days nearly two hundred people had visited the Debian
booth, mostly asking how to help and join the Debian Project or asking
more specific questions regarding, for example, Debian's stance on LibreOffice
or the internal structure of the project and its governance. Many people also
visited the booth simply to express their appreciation for the release of
<q>Squeeze</q>, the new website layout, and the new spacefun theme.
At the booth a Debian GNU/kFreeBSD box was also present, as a technological
preview, which attracted some interest from visitors.
<br />
Alexander wants to thank our sponsors <a
href="http://www.univention.de/">Univention</a> and Deutsche Messe AG, as well
as the Debian folks who help with the booth.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the Debian Project Leader</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110306183248.GA5144@upsilon.cc">email describing the aftermath
of the <q>Squeeze</q> release</a>. One of the important points in his email is
the discussions between Debian and the Free Software Foundation. The 
discussions touch on the different areas of focus of the two projects 
even though both projects are working to develop Free Software. Stefano
also lists a number of interviews in various places regarding the <q>Squeeze</q>
release. There are also some links in the email to talks given
and clearly he's been quite busy.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="fsf">Happy birthday, FSFE!</toc-add-entry>
<p>The <a href="http://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe</a> is
<a href="http://fsfe.org/news/2011/news-20110310-01">celebrating its 10th
birthday</a>!  Congratulations!  To celebrate this important date, it is
planned to highlight important events in <a
href="http://fsfe.org/about/history/birthday10">FSFE's history</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="election">Upcoming elections for the Debian Project Leader</toc-add-entry>
<p>Debian Project Secretary Kurt Roeckx published the time line for this
year's <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110304183818.GA24016@roeckx.be">Debian
project leader elections</a>.  The Nomination period has already ended on Friday,
March 11.  The current Debian Project Leader
Stefano Zacchiroli will again be a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110306152941.GA1628@upsilon.cc">candidate</a>.
From Saturday, March 12 until
April 1, candidates will campaign and discuss, followed by the
actual voting period from Saturday, April 2, 2011 until Friday, April
15 2011.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="geodns">Geographical mirror selection as default?</toc-add-entry>
<p>The topic of using some kind of GeoMirror for new installations has been
brought up on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/201103050951.00942.elmig@debianpt.org">debian-boot</a>
mailing list, and later also on the general <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/1299747535.3524.12.camel@havelock.lan">debian-devel</a>
list.  Various pros and cons were exchanged including possible
problems with DNSSEC and different approaches based upon <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/apt-spy">apt-spy</a> or <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/netselect-apt">netselect-apt</a>, or DNS
based approaches.  APT developer Michael Vogt posted some hints that apt
recently had a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110310195547.GA24278@localhost">useful
feature</a> added
for a similar purpose, allowing general <tt>deb mirrors://</tt> lines
to be specified as apt sources.  Just the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg00512.html">server
side</a> is missing,
but that's already being <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110311112014.GD9247@anguilla.noreply.org">worked on</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="cupt">New version of Cupt coming up</toc-add-entry>
<p>Eugene Lyubimkin blogged about an <a
href="http://jackyf.livejournal.com/115115.html">upcoming release of
Cupt</a>, an alternative front-end for the dpkg package manager.  The most
notable feature: if there's no solution to satisfy the actions requested
by a user, Cupt will not only show an error message, but also show why the
dependencies couldn't be resolved.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="arm">Bits from ARM and embedded sprint</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The ARM and embedded Debian teams had the opportunity to meet up
at ARM offices in Cambridge for a 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/20110301110302.GA25977@enorme">Debian Sprint</a>.
There are lots of things happening on ARM and in embedded land.
There is an ongoing effort to build a new Debian port (named
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatPort">armhf</a>)
which will provide a more efficient userland, suitable for modern ARM
chips (v7), as found in recent netbooks, tablets, nettops, and smartphones.
</p>
<p>
There have also been great improvements in support for <q>multiarch</q>.
This will make it possible to cross-install libraries from a foreign
userland, and thus run things like i386 non-free Flash on amd64 systems.
Cross-building support is also being integrated into Debian itself,
so developers should soon be able to easily create applications
on their desktops to run on their ARM devices running Debian.
</p>
<p>
Inspired by Eben Moglen's vision of a small, cheap, and simple
computer that serves freedom in the home, the teams are building a Debian
based platform for distributed applications which could help replace
centralized services provided by the cloud.
FreedomBox is about privacy, control, ease of use, and decentralization.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="bts">More graphs for the Debian Bug Tracking System</toc-add-entry>
<p>Mike Hommey added several new features to the <a
href="http://glandium.org/blog/?p=1817">graphs of Debian's Bug
Tracking System</a>.  Besides having per package graphs, it's now also
possible to have data for multiple packages consolidated into a single
graph, or <a
href="http://qa.debian.org/data/bts/graphs/by-maint/tolimar.png">graphs per
maintainer</a>.</p>



<toc-add-entry name="twid">Further <q>This week in Debian</q> interviews</toc-add-entry>

	<p>Since the last issue of the Debian Project News, 
three new issues of the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ThisWeekInDebian"><q>This week in
	Debian</q> podcast</a> have been published:  with
<a
href="http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-19">Stefano
Zacchiroli</a>, Debian Project Leader; with
<a
href="http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-20">Jon
<q>Maddog</q> Hall</a>, about Project Cau&atilde;; and with <a
href="http://frostbitemedia.libsyn.com/this-week-in-debian-episode-21">Adnan
Hodzic</a>, about Debconf 2011 in Bosnia.
</p>

	<p>There has also been 
one further <q>People behind Debian</q> interview: with
<a
href="http://raphaelhertzog.com/2011/03/03/people-behind-debian-christian-perrier-translation-coordinator/">Christian
Perrier</a>, translation coordinator.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>The 26th issue of the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/1299689793.12966.64.camel@chianamo">miscellaneous news for developers</a> 
has been released and covers the following topics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>DebConf news</li>
  <li>Multiarch support</li>
  <li>win32-loader.exe available from the mirrors network</li>
  <li>Team-specific NM questions</li>
  <li>Debian games team meeting</li>
</ul>

<p>Yves-Alexis Perez gave an <a
href="http://www.corsac.net/?rub=blog&amp;post=1528">update on Xfce 4.8</a>.
The packages for the new upstream release of the desktop environment have
been assembled in Debian's <q>experimental</q> branch and he's now synchronizing 
with the release team over when an upload to Debian's <q>unstable</q> branch will
be possible.</p>

<p>Cyril Brulebois published the <a
href="http://blog.ikibiki.org/2011/03/04/DXN-7/">seventh issue of the
<q>Debian XSF News</q></a>.  He mentions various events concerning Debian's
X.org packages, and closes with an impressive statistic: the number of open
bug reports for X.org-related packages has dropped from 880 in November down to 540
now.</p>

<p>Holger Levsen, Moray Allan, and Gunnar Wolf have been delegated as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/20110309091510.GA22436@upsilon.cc">\
<q>DebConf Chairs</q></a>.  While the organization of the yearly Debian
Conference remains unchanged, the three will now act as liaison between the
Debian Project and the DebConf project.</p>

<p>FTP-Master J&ouml;rg Jaspert announced an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/87ipx0g76w.fsf@gkar.ganneff.de">upcoming
meeting of the FTP-Team</a> from the 21st to the 27th of March in
the <a href="http://www.linuxhotel.de/">LinuxHotel</a> in Essen, Germany.
He also announced the current agenda for the meeting (ranging from internal
stuff like <q>buildd autosigning</q> up to end-user-oriented services like
<tt>data.debian.org</tt>).</p>

<p>Tollef Fog Heen wondered
if it would be useful to harmonize the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/87zkpi5xwo.fsf@qurzaw.varnish-software.com">naming
of flags to enable and disable services</a> via their configuration snippets in
<tt>/etc/default</tt>.  Others added in the thread that there could also be
better (UI-)tools to do so, or to customize runlevels.  It was also
pointed out that the interface has been complicated by the introduction of <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/insserv">insserv</a>.</p>
