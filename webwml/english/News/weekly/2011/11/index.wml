<p>Welcome to this year's eleventh issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>
<toc-display/>

<toc-add-entry name="linux-birthday">Happy Birthday, Linux!</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Twenty years ago a Finnish student mentioned that he was <q><a
href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b">doing
a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won't be big and professional like
gnu)</a></q> thus marking the birth of the Linux kernel.  A lot <a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/20th/images/linux20infographic.png">has
happened</a> since then. But since it was the base of the Debian operating system,
we would like to join the <a
href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/20th/">birthday celebrations</a>.
</p>
<p>
Dear Linux developers, many thanks for a stable, portable and powerful kernel
to base our work on!  Keep up your good work!
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="faq-patent">Community Distribution Patent Policy FAQ</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Project <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110709">has just published</a>
the <a href="$(HOME)/reports/patent-faq">Community Distribution Patent
Policy FAQ</a>, a document meant to educate Free Software developers,
and especially distribution editors, about software patent risks.
It has been prepared by lawyers at the <a
href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">Software Freedom Law Center</a>
(SFLC) at the request of and with input from the Debian Project.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli sent some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/07/msg00001.html">bits
from the DPL</a> in which he covered a lot of interesting topics such as
the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-debbugs/2011/07/msg00000.html">request
for help from the Debbugs Team</a>, the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-derivatives/2011/06/msg00010.html">completion
of the first DEX initiatives</a>, the sprints approved (one for the
Release Team and one for Debian Edu) and various interviews given.
Another exciting news item reported by Stefano is that he has finally filed
the application to extend the Debian trademark to the United Kingdom, Europe, China and Japan.
</p>

<p>
In a previous mail, Stefano officially appointed <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/07/msg00000.html">\
Alexander Wirt and Gerfried Fuchs as members of the Backports Team</a>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="hurd">Bits from the Debian GNU/Hurd porters</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Samuel Thibault sent some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/07/msg00002.html">bits
from the Debian GNU/Hurd porters</a> in which he summarized some interesting
news about the Hurd port. First of all, thanks to Jeremie Koenig, 
a working CD set is now available for installing Debian GNU/Hurd. Samuel
also wrote about the <q>Wheezy</q> release goal: since hurd-i386 is <q>in
not-bad shape</q>, it is now included in the archive, and the idea is to officially
release the port in <q>Wheezy</q> as at least a technical preview.
Meanwhile, the percentage of packages built for Debian GNU/Hurd is
reaching about 68%; the remaining packages are either waiting for other
packages to become available (a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/graph-radial.pdf">graph of these
relationships</a> is also available) or failing for some reason. Also the hardware support
for current hardware is becoming more complete.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="debconf13">Call for DebConf13 bids</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Moray Allan made a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/07/msg00007.html">\
call for DebConf13 bids</a>. As he says: <q>there will be a chance to describe your bid to
the rest of the DebConf attendees during a special session at DebConf11, probably on 30 July.</q>
Even if you can't participate in this event you can send some slides to present your bid. If you
want to organize DebConf in your city, please make a page for your bid in the <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Main_Page">DebConf wiki</a>, and add a link to the <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13">DebConf13 page</a>. Before this don't forget to
read the <a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/LocationCheckList">location checklist page</a>. You can
also look at <a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Category:DebConf11_bids">this year's</a> and
<a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/Category:DebConf12_bids">next year's</a> bids as examples.
You can get additional information in the <tt>#debconf-team</tt> channel on irc.debian.org.

<toc-add-entry name="spamclean">33094 spam messages removed from Debian
Mailing Lists archives</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Christian Perrier blogged about the <a
href="http://www.perrier.eu.org/weblog/2011/07/10#spam-cleaning-status">results
of the Spam Cleaning Campaign</a>. Since 2009 the Debian Listmasters have created a
<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2009/04/msg00012.html">working
toolset</a> to remove spam from mailing list archives in a three
step process:</p>
<ul>
<li>report spam in the archives through the <q>Report as spam</q> button
(when browsing archives via the web) or by bouncing the mail to
report-listspam@lists.debian.org;</li>
<li>review nominated spam: Debian Developers can <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/archive-spam-removals/review/">\
ask for an account</a> and process
through the nominated posts;</li>
<li>posts confirmed as spam by at least three reviewers were removed from
the archives.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There have also been coordinated efforts in reporting and reviewing spam for
some mailing lists:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SpamClean">debian-boot</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/I18n/FrenchSpamClean">French lists
(debian-devel-french, debian-l10n-french, debian-user-french)</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/I18n/ItalianSpamClean">Italian lists
(debian-devel-italian, debian-italian, debian-l10n-italian)</a>;</li> 
<li><a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Publicity/SpamClean">debian-publicity</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/KdeSpamClean">KDE lists (debian-kde and
debian-qt-kde)</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Webmaster/SpamClean">debian-www</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As a result of this initiative, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/archive-spam-removals/review/stats.html">over thirty-three thousand messages were
classified as spam and removed from the archives</a>.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="releaseteam">Bits from the Release Team</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Neil McGovern sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/06/msg00003.html">\
report on the recent sprint</a> the Release Team had
in Antwerp, along with some more information.
He prepared a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Sprints/2011/Release/Detail">\
retrospective</a> of the <q>Squeeze</q> release, referencing good points
(e.g. high quality release, unblock handling, good communications) and bad
points (e.g. freeze announcements, clarity of process, manpower in the team).
Pierre Habouzit chose to leave the team due to other commitments and was
thanked for his hard work, while Niels Thykier was welcomed to the team.
A time-based freeze will be tried for the <q>Wheezy</q>
release, with <b>June 2012</b> picked as the proposed freeze date.
They are also preparing a move to <tt>britney2</tt>, a new generation script
to migrate packages from <q>unstable</q> to <q>testing</q>, and are preparing another
update where various subjects will be presented, among them the release
goals, 0-day NMU policy, CUT/Rolling and the package removal process.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="hardware">Debian hardware certification</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Thomas Goirand asked about the possibility for some companies to have
their <a href="https://lists.debian.org/4DD898DF.4020109@goirand.fr">\
hardware certified as compatible with Debian</a>.
Stefano Zacchiroli <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20110704093224.GA31157@upsilon.cc">asked
for volunteers</a> to provide a wrapper around Kenshi Muto's <a
href="http://kmuto.jp/debian/hcl/">Debian GNU/Linux device driver check
&amp; report</a> web interface as an initial step in that direction.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="multiarch">Multiarch in Debian <q>unstable</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>
Steve Langasek announced <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/06/msg00002.html">the
start of multiarch support on Debian <q>unstable</q></a>, which provides a policy
for combining library packages from an arbitrary number of architectures
on a single filesystem. The next steps towards providing full multiarch
support in Debian will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>conversion of shared library packages to multiarch;</li>
<li>package manager support - so far it is hasn't been possible to
install copies of a package for multiple architectures side by side.</li>
</ul>
<p>
This second step is already being worked on: a preliminary implementation
of multiarch support for dpkg is available from the
<tt>pu/multiarch/full</tt> branch of
<tt>git://git.debian.org/users/hertzog/dpkg.git</tt>.
</p>

## NOTE:
## should be reworded (this time only)!

<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Kenshi Muto announced an <a href="http://kmuto.jp/b.cgi/debian/d-i-2638-squeeze2.htm">\
update of the backported debian-installer for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q></a>. Updated
images are available on <a href="http://kmuto.jp/debian/d-i/">his images archive page</a>.
These images are based on Debian 6.0.2.1 and contain kernel version 2.6.38 with firmware and
a modified DHCP client for buggy Mac OS X DHCP servers. The i386 architecture is now also supported.
Please note that these are unofficial images and you should use them only if you really need this.
