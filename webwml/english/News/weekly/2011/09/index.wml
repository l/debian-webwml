<toc-add-entry name="Linuxtag">Report from LinuxTag 2011</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Jan Hauke Rahm sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/05/msg00046.html">report
from the LinuxTag event</a> held in Berlin, Germany. This year, Debian
shared a booth with Kanotix and aptosid, so one of the main topics was
the relationship between Debian and its derivatives. Users also asked
about various hot topics like the implementation of a <q>rolling</q>
version of Debian, new efforts like <q>/run</q>, etc.
Jan expressed thanks to Annette Kalbow for organizing, and all the
helpers at the booth: a team of about ten to fifteen people everyday.

<toc-add-entry name="hwsupport">Testing new hardware support for Debian 6.0.2</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Ben Hutchings blogged about <a
href="http://womble.decadent.org.uk/blog/testing-new-hardware-support-for-debian-602.html">testing
new hardware support for Debian 6.0.2</a>. Ben has prepared several updates intended
for Debian's point release 6.0.2. Since the kernel team does not have a large
collection of hardware on which to test driver changes, he is asking for test reports from users.
Ben also described changes in drivers, showed where to get the <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~benh/packages/">updated packages</a> and their <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~benh/packages/linux-2.6_2.6.32-35~test1_multi.changes">checksums
in the signed changes file</a> so that users who want to help can verify downloaded packages,
and explained how to test the drivers.

<toc-add-entry name="perlbits">Bits from the Perl maintainers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Dominic Hargreaves sent some <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/05/msg00006.html">bits
from the Perl maintainers</a>, which describe changes in Debian's <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/main/perl">perl</a>
package. First of all, around twelve months after the first upstream 5.12 release,
Perl 5.12.3 was uploaded to <q>unstable</q>. Dominic thanked the Release Team for the
superb work of migrating new Perl packages to <q>testing</q>. Although the
Perl maintainers did their best to minimize Perl 5.12 specific breakage, he pointed out that
there will inevitably be occasional problems to be fixed. An upgrade trigger
is also available in this major version. At the end of his message,
Dominic published plans for the Perl 5.14 release which will be
uploaded to <q>unstable</q> later this year.

<toc-add-entry name="alioth">Report from the Alioth sprint</toc-add-entry>

<p>Roland Mas sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/05/msg00010.html">report
from the Alioth sprint</a> held in Cambridge, England from 20 to 22
May in the course of which the three Alioth administrators (Stephan Gran, Tollef Fog
Heen, and Roland Mas) did an incredible amount of work to redefine the
hosting structure of Alioth.
Basically, they have split the old <code>alioth.debian.org</code> into two different machines:
<code>vasks.debian.org</code> and <code>wagner.debian.org</code>, both running <q>Squeeze</q>.
The former hosts the writable repositories, while the latter provides
anonymous read-only access to repositories, the repository browsers, and the project websites.
So, it's time for a
<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/05/msg00007.html">fingerprint</a>
<a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/05/msg00008.html">update
</a> for the two hosts.
Another important change is that now password-only remote logins
are no longer allowed, and only SSH logins via RSA key are possible.
During the sprint the basic setting up was done, trying to minimize
inconvenience for users: the Alioth team is still working on some
<a href="http://titanpad.com/yyhfwA9Pyr">other issues</a>.
You can also read further details of the Alioth team's work
during the sprint in the report mail.
Roland ends his mail with a thankyou to the DPL and Collabora for triggering
and hosting the sprint.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="DPL">Bits from the DPL</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent another <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/06/msg00000.html">bits
from the DPL</a> report. He summarized some of the hot topics discussed
in the Debian development mailing list, such as the
<q>rolling</q> release, pointing out how discussions in the
<tt>debian-devel</tt> mailing list have become more useful.
After listing the various events and conferences attended, Stefano
announced that he's working with SPI to figure out how — legally speaking —
it could be possible to set up a <q>PPA</q> service, to <q>allow Debian
Developers to provide, under their own responsibility, unofficial Debian
packages benefiting from the usual archive and buildd toolchain</q>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="mirrors">New mirrors closer to Debian users</toc-add-entry>

<p>After the
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110525">announcement</a> of
the <a href="http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian/">official Chinese mirror</a>, the
Debian mirrors team is happy to announce the first Debian mirrors in
<a href="http://debian.mirror.tn/debian/">Tunisia</a> and
<a href="http://mg.debian.net/debian/">Madagascar</a>.
For other countries, the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">full
list</a> is available online.
There are still many countries lacking good connectivity to a Debian mirror:
interested hosting sponsors are invited to contact the mirrors team.

<toc-add-entry name="press">Debian in newspapers</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Per Andersson and Hedvig Kamp wrote a series of article about Free
Software in general, and Debian in particular, in <q>Fria Tidningen</q>
a Swedish newspaper. One article is titled <a
href="http://www.fria.nu/artikel/88296">Det demokratiska Debian</a>
(<q>The democratic Debian</q>), and describes Debian's organization
and social responsibility. Hedvig Kamp wrote about
<a href="http://www.fria.nu/artikel/88292">nerdfeminism and groups
that promote equality in free software</a>; among other groups she
presents Debian Women in the article (in the paper edition
there is a great big Debian Women logo too). Also in the paper is a <a
href="http://www.fria.nu/artikel/88301">general
guide on how to install GNU/Linux</a>, with Debian as one of the
featured distros.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="other">Other news</toc-add-entry>

<p>Rene Engelhard, maintainer of Debian's LibreOffice packages, was
appointed as a <a
href="http://blog.documentfoundation.org/2011/05/23/the-document-foundation-announces-the-members-of-the-engineering-steering-committee/">\
member of LibreOffice's new Engineering Steering Committee</a>,
which discusses release progress and coordinates development
activities.</p>

<p>Tanguy Ortolo wrote an interesting article about <a
href="http://tanguy.ortolo.eu/blog/article8/uninstall-meta-package">uninstalling
a single component of a metapackage</a>, explaining how to unmark all
the dependencies and recommendations of the metapackage itself.</p>

<p>Till Kamppeter proposed some <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/05/msg01223.html">\
cooperation between Debian and Ubuntu to start work on Color Management</a>. As
Didier Raboud
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/06/msg00012.html">said
in this thread</a>, <q>this type of communication between Debian and its
derivatives (and reversely in that case) is very important for the health of
our ecosystem</q>.</p>
