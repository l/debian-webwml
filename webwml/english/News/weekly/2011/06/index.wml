<toc-add-entry name="wheezy">Bits from the Release Team &mdash; Kicking off <q>Wheezy</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>
Neil McGovern sent some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/03/msg00016.html">\
bits from the Release Team</a> calling for feedback on the recent release.
He also addresses various subjects that are currently under discussion:
time-based freezes, transitions, release goals, sprint organisation and
0-day NMU policy.
</p>

# Removal: Old libs, HAL, defoma
<p>
Luk Claes proposed (amongst other ideas) continuing the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00492.html">\
removal of obsolete libraries</a>. Josselin Mouette suggested <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00493.html">\
starting</a> with <a href="http://packages.debian.org/src:hal">HAL</a> and
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/src:gnome-vfs">gnome-vfs</a></code>.
Although there has been some progress towards getting rid of HAL (still used by
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/xserver-xorg">xserver-xorg</a></code>
on kFreeBSD), Cyril Brulebois pointed out that <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01194.html">\
this effort is stalled for now</a>.
Christian Perrier also proposed to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01166.html">\
drop </a><code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/defoma">defoma</a></code>.
</p>

# NM as Default (next: libreoffice-writer as standard text editor)
<p>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01146.html">\
Limitations</a> in <code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/ifupdown">ifupdown</a></code>
led to calls for an
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01167.html">\
overhaul</a> of Debian's default network management infrastructure.
<code><a
href="http://packages.debian.org/network-manager">network-manager</a></code>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00041.html">could
be adopted</a> to this end, though this proposal has provoked a great many
objections, whether
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00051.html">\
rational</a> or <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00120.html">\
less so</a>.
</p>

# Other Release Goals
<p>
Among other <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01136.html">\
release goal proposals</a> (such as read-only root file system and
C.UTF-8 provided by default), Roger Leigh started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/03/msg01118.html">\
discussion about supporting <code>/run</code> for <q>Wheezy</q></a>.</p>

<p>
Stefano Zacchiroli proposed <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2011/03/msg00510.html">\
some further release goals</a> relating to package quality, and relaunched the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2011/04/msg00091.html">\
time based freezes</a> proposal.  He argued that fixed freeze dates would
allow Debian's developer base to improve planning and coordination with
upstream developers, and underlined that the first part of the
<q>Squeeze</q> freeze (blocking library transitions while being lax about
general migration of new packages) was quite successful, and that it
should be done similarly in the future.  While the time frame for such
freezes (and <a href="http://lists.debian.org/20110404070550.GL21476@rivendell.home.ouaza.com">how
they should be announced</a>) is still being discussed, there generally seems to be a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/20110407160009.GA25468@upsilon.cc">consensus
in favour</a>.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="debconf">Registration now open for DebConf11 and call for contributions</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Gunnar Wolf announced the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/04/msg00005.html">\
opening of DebConf11 registration</a>.
<a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/register.xhtml">Registration
instructions</a> are available and the deadline for sponsored food and
accommodation is 8 May 2011. A <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110408">\
call for contributions</a> has also been sent, and the organisers
welcome all sort of submissions: performances, art installations,
debates, or anything else can be proposed as well as traditional talks.
There will be a poster session this year.
More information on submissions of events or posters is available on
the <a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/cfp.xhtml">DebConf11
website</a> and the deadline for submissions is also 8 May 2011.

<toc-add-entry name="FTPMaster">Report from the FTP Master meeting</toc-add-entry>

<p>
J&ouml;rg Jaspert sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/03/msg00015.html">report
from the FTP Master meeting</a> which was held at Linux Hotel in Essen,
21&ndash;27 March. During the meeting a lot of work was done, in
various areas:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
an upgrade of the main archive machine (as well as backports and
security machines) to <q>Squeeze</q> was performed;
</li>
<li>
the update frequency
of the DD accessible copy of the <code>dak</code> installation (moved from
<tt>merkel.debian.org</tt> to <tt>ries.debian.org</tt>) was changed to
reflect the database changes immediately
</li> 
<li>
a new field (<code>Built-Using</code>) was implemented in <code>dak</code>
and a related patch for <code><a
href="http://packages.debian.org/dpkg">dpkg</a></code> has been prepared
</li> 
<li>
the creation of the <code>Maintainers</code> and <code>Uploaders</code> files
was sped up (from roughly 15 minutes to about a minute)
</li> 
<li>
the project of enabling autosigning for the buildds has finally been completed
</li> 
<li>binary-all <code>dists</code> files were added</li> 
</ul>

<p>
Meanwhile, in a discussion with the Debian GNU/Hurd porters it was
decided that the Hurd port will stay on <tt>ftp-master.debian.org</tt>
until <q>Wheezy</q> is released, while the alpha port will be completely
removed from Debian and the hppa port will move over to <tt>debian-ports.org</tt>.

As a side note, J&ouml;rg added that during the meeting Ansgar Burchardt was
appointed to the post of FTP Assistant; congratulations, Ansgar!
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="cant">The Canterbury Project: an amazing example of
cross-distro collaboration</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Gerfried Fuchs blogged from <a
href="http://rhonda.deb.at/blog/debian/the-canterbury-project.html">behind
the scenes of one of the most hilarious &mdash; and well orchestrated &mdash;
April Fools' pranks of this year: the Canterbury Project</a>. As you probably
noticed, on the morning of April the first, the homepages of Arch Linux,
Debian, Gentoo, Grml and OpenSUSE were replaced by a <a
href="http://www.debian.org/misc/canterbury">placeholder</a> announcing the
merging of all these distributions into one new one.
In the posting, Gerfried said that the initial idea was to simply do a sort of
exchange of homepages between participants. <q>Then the thing happened which
the Free Software community is so well known for: additional ideas came in,
two people independently addressed me whether it wouldn't be better that
instead of a circle replacement of the frontpage, why not display the same
page on all of them. And one of them added that a corresponding news item
might make sense.</q> said Gerfried. Another example of new ideas coming
up during the whole Canterbury Project was the introduction of the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/cant">cant package manager</a> (see also
<a href="http://blog.schmehl.info/Debian/cant-package-manager">Alexander's
blog for details</a>).
Gerfried revealed also the reason behind the name <q>Canterbury</q>: it was
adopted when Alexander Reichle-Schmehl noticed that, according to the
relevant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">Wikipedia
page</a>, <q>the earliest recorded association between April 1 and foolishness
can be found in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (1392)</q>.
As a final note, Gerfried added that even if the all-in-one distribution was only
a joke, the cross-distro collaboration was real and exciting, and thanked all
the participants for their efforts.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="med">Report from Med@Tel</toc-add-entry>

<p>Andreas Tille sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/04/msg00024.html">report
from the Med@Tel conference</a> held in Luxembourg and dedicated to medicine
informatics. This year, Andreas delivered a talk titled <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/talks/201104_luxembourg"><q>Benefits of
Free/Libre Open Source Software in Health Care (FLOSS-HC): Communities,
Collaboration, Development Issues, Technology Transfer</q></a>, based on a
paper written by the Debian Med team. As Andreas reported, the talk was well
received and the main impression is that the Debian Med Blend itself is
considered as a really helpful and needed thing. It also seems that
Debian Med and other important &mdash; and very useful &mdash; Blends are little known
by the wider public.
For this reason, Andreas proposed to use microblogging to better promote the existence of
Debian Med and &mdash; in the following thread &mdash; <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2011/04/msg00032.html">many
other ways to improve the visibility of Debian Blends</a>.
