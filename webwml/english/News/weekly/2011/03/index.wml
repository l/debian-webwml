<p>Welcome to this year's third issue of DPN, the newsletter for the
Debian community. Topics covered in this issue include:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="squeeze">Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q> released</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Almost two years after Debian 5.0 <q>Lenny</q> was released, <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110205a">Debian 6.0
<q>Squeeze</q> was released on the 6th of February, 2011</a>.
Among other improvements, the completely free
Linux kernel now shipped in Debian has been <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/news/debian-squeeze-makes-key-progress-toward-being-a-fully-free-distribution">\
welcomed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Adam D. Barratt, Release Team manager, has already announced a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/1296956851.16209.5044.camel@hathi.jungle.funky-badger.org">\
first point release planned for next month</a> and gave advice to maintainers
about further uploads to <q>unstable</q>: <q>Wheezy</q> is already on people's minds.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="website">New layout and website related news</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110205b">new look for Debian's websites</a>
is already available on some of the Debian project's main web interfaces.
Gerfried Fuchs sent a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20110202134918.GA3275@anguilla.debian.or.at">\
report about the last WWW Sprint</a> where members of the team
prepared this new layout, smashed and triaged some bugs filed
against the <code>www.debian.org</code> pseudo-package, and discussed other
topics such as whether there is any interest in moving away from CVS.
Martin Zobel-Helas, member of the DSA team who actively worked for
this to happen, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/20110206015402.GA22858@ftbfs.de">\
thanked the team</a> for putting the new layout proposed by
Kalle S&ouml;derman on line in time for the release of Debian <q>Squeeze</q>.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="backports">Backports for <q>Squeeze</q> easier for users</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Alexander Wirt announced the start of <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/20110208223822.GB21292@smithers.snow-crash.org">\
the next generation of backports</a>.
Users of <q>Squeeze</q> (and <q>Lenny</q>) will be offered new versions of
packages available in testing (<q>Wheezy</q>) via
<code>squeeze-backports</code> (and <code>lenny-backports-sloppy</code>).
He also explained to maintainers how to upload packages to the backports archive.
A recent change introduced in APT makes out-of-the-box use of
<code>squeeze-backports</code> <a href="http://backports.debian.org/Instructions/">\
easier than ever before</a>, without the need to
configure pinning for the backports repository in order to handle upgrades
to new versions of packages installed from there.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="volatile">Volatile replaced by new updates suite</toc-add-entry>

<p>
The Debian Volatile archive has been replaced by the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110215">new updates suite</a>: starting from this stable release
(<q>Squeeze</q>), packages that were handled via the Volatile repository
will enter the official release via the <code>squeeze-updates</code> suite.
Updated packages will also be included in the stable point
release following the announcement published in the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/">\
debian-stable-announce mailing list</a>.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dpl">Bits from the Debian Project Leader</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli sent another <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/20110204151502.GA10245@upsilon.cc">\
bits from the DPL</a> report.
He discusses collaboration with others (via for example the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110124">Debian derivatives census</a> or the
<a href="http://www.enricozini.org/2011/debian/appinstaller2011/">\
cross-distribution meeting</a>) and communication
with people from other projects and companies (via his latest
<a href="http://lca2011.linux.org.au/programme/schedule/view_talk/153">\
<q>Who the bloody hell cares about Debian?</q> talk</a>).
He also touches on the relationship between Debian and DebConf in
matters such as the <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/goals.shtml">goals</a> that were recently
published, and is looking for volunteers as DebConf chairs.
<br />
Stefano has also been interviewed for <a
href="http://www.linuxoutlaws.com/podcast/191">Linux Outlaws
Podcast</a>. 
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="dc">DebConf communication channels and decisions</toc-add-entry>

<p>Richard Darst blogged on the <a
href="http://www.debian-administration.org/users/rkd/weblog/16">\
Debian Administration site</a> about the various communication
channels in the DebConf organization. DebConf is the group that
manages the yearly Debian Conference. He mentioned the various
connected media that the DebConf team uses, including IRC, wiki, and
mailing lists, describing how each channel is used and how to contribute.
</p>



<toc-add-entry name="merchandise">Handling Debian Merchandise</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Have you ever wondered where Debian T-Shirts and other goodies come from?
How can you get your hands on a cool <q>Squeeze</q> T-Shirt? Well, the answer
lies with the Debian Merchandising team who co-ordinate Debian merchandise
for the various events where a Debian representative appears. Luca Capello,
known as Gismo, wrote about the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2011/02/msg00101.html">\
Merchandising team</a> to explain how it all works.
You can also have a look at an <a href="$(HOME)/misc/merchandise">\
overview of what Debian offers</a>.
</p>


<toc-add-entry name="gci">Debian Google Code-in 2010-2011 report</toc-add-entry>

<p>Ana Guerrero L&oacute;pez blogged about the <a
href="http://ekaia.org/blog/2011/02/01/debian-at-the-google-code-in-2010-11/">Debian
participation at this year's Google Code-in</a>. Even though preparation for the
contest started quite late, and few tasks were open to those without a Debian installation,
<q>we got a moderate success</q>. As Ana says: about 30 students have
participated, doing 39 tasks mostly related to translation, bug triaging, and
writing documentation.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="twid">Further <q>This week in Debian</q> interviews</toc-add-entry>
