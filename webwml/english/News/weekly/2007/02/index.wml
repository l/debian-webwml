# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 2nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community. Anthony Towns was <a
href="http://www.computerworld.com.au/index.php/id;189708751;pp;1">interviewed</a>
by Liz Tay on whether <a href="http://www.dunc-tank.org/">Dunc Tank</a> was a
failure or success.  Joey Schulze <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/log/?200701291912">reported</a> that the
<a href="$(HOME)/ports/alpha/">alpha</a> port has caught up and is fitter than
before since it now has two working build daemon.</p>

<p><strong>Dealing with personal Configuration and Data.</strong>
Aigars Mahinovs <a
href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2007/01/10/fhs-extension-for-user-home-folders/">\
proposed</a> a standard for applications to organise data and configuration
files stored in the user's home directory as an extension to the <a
href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a>.  It
should first implemented in Debian and then passed upstream.  Mark Hymers <a
href="http://www.aigarius.com/blog/2007/01/10/fhs-extension-for-user-home-folders/#comment-20060">\
pointed out</a> that the <a
href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html">\
XDG Base Directory Specification</a> from Waldo Bastian addresses
configuration files already.</p>

<p><strong>Social Committee for Debian?</strong> Josip Rodin <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2007/01/msg00063.html">proposed</a>
to found a social committee that will deal with social problems within the
Debian project, similar to the technical committee handling technical issues.
It would have its own charter and would delegate communications coordinators
to particular teams and mailing lists to observe and ensure that no complaints
go unnoticed.</p>

<p><strong>Request for Translation Updates.</strong>  Javier Fernández-Sanguino
Peña <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/01/msg00002.html">\
asked</a> maintainers to take the chance to upload packages with only
translation updates.  Such modification have a good chance to be granted a freeze
exception by the release team.  Even after the <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~lwall/i18n/nmu/">NMU Campaign</a> aimed to
fix pending <a href="https://people.debian.org/~lwall/i18n/">localisation bugs</a> in
the <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/">bug tracking system</a>, there are still many packages
with open bugs.  Maintainers are encouraged to sent a message to <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n">debian-i18n</a> asking for
translation updates.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Loader.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/01/msg01083.html">announced</a>
the availability of a Debian-Installer Loader for win32.  The program, inspired by Ubuntu's
<a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/install.exe">similar project</a>, features 64-bit CPU auto-detection,
download of kernel and initrd netboot images, and chain-loading into
Debian-Installer via <a href="http://grub4dos.sf.net/">grub4dos</a>.
Graphical installations are <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2007/01/msg01092.html">supported</a>
as well.  The frontend site <a
href="http://goodbye-microsoft.com/">goodbye-microsoft.com</a> has been setup
for advocacy purposes.</p>

<p><strong>New UTF-8 Migration Wizard.</strong> Martin-Éric Racine <a
href="http://q-funk.blogspot.com/2007/01/utf-8-migration-tool-now-in-debian.html">\
announced</a> that a new GTK2-based <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/utf8-migration-tool">migration</a> tool for
UTF-8 has been uploaded into
the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/unstable/">unstable</a> distribution. It
allows an easy migration to UTF-8 for both locale settings and user file
encodings. Martin-Éric Racine <a
href="http://q-funk.blogspot.com/2006/12/rfa-utf8-migration-tool-debian-utf-8.html">\
recently</a> took over the development of this tool which was previously
developed for Ubuntu.</p>

<p><strong>Proposal for an official Screenshot Repository.</strong>  Roberto C.
Sanchez <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00089.html">requested</a>
comments about the idea of having an official archive of screenshots that
would allow users to browse through images of GUI packages, a service similar
to <a href="https://packages.debian.org">packages.debian.org</a> for descriptions.
Nico Golde <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00091.html">pointed</a>
a similar <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/04/msg00915.html">\
discussion</a> in 2006.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at the Chemnitzer Linux-Tage 2007.</strong> The Debian
project will maintain a booth at the this years' <a
href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/info/">Chemnitzer Linux-Tage</a>
taking place from March, 3rd to 4th at the Technical University of Chemnitz.
Torsten Werner will give a talk about <a
href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/vortraege/detail.html?idx=508">\
advanced Debian packaging</a> and Jörg Jaspert will discuss  <a
href="http://chemnitzer.linux-tage.de/2007/vortraege/detail.html?idx=578">\
virtualisation using Xen on Debian</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Conference Deadline.</strong> Jörg Jaspert <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/01/msg00001.html">\
announced</a> that participants need to register on <a
href="http://penta.debconf.org/">Pentabarf</a> until Wednesday January 31st,
2007 if they would like to apply for sponsored accommodation, food
or travel, or if they are planning to submit a talk or event proposal.  This
years' <a href="http://debconf7.debconf.org/">Debian Conference</a> will take
place in Edinburgh from June 17th to 23rd, 2007.</p>

<p><strong>Keeping virtual Disks clean.</strong>  Aleksandr Koltsoff <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00054.html">\
announced</a> <a href="http://koltsoff.com/pub/zerotools/">zerotools</a>, a set
of tools to aid keeping virtual disks clean by filling binary zero to those
regions which are no longer in use.  These tools should not be used to make data
retrieval close to impossible.  The author also noticed that no Debian packages
were available.  Amaya Rodrigo Sastre <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00058.html">added</a>
information about <code>zum</code>, a similar tool that is part of <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/perforate">perforate</a>, a package
maintained by her.</p>

<p><strong>Updates during the Etch Life Cycle.</strong>  Luis Matos <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00080.html">\
proposed</a> to add kernel updates on stable point releases in order to support
more hardware and to keep using <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-volatile/">\
volatile</a> and <a href="http://www.backports.org/">backports</a> for other
programs.  Moritz Mühlenhoff <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2007/01/msg00094.html">added</a>
that there are plans for a second set of kernels (and probably X servers) nine
months after the release of <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a>, which
will also have security support.  However, nothing
is fixed yet, as the current focus is on getting etch ready for release.</p>

<p><strong>Architecture Release Requirements?</strong>  Thomas Bushnell <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/01/msg00820.html">\
wondered</a> why <a href="$(HOME)/ports/alpha/">alpha</a> is a release
architecture since it doesn't fulfil the architecture <a
href="https://release.debian.org/etch_arch_qualify.html">requirements</a> of
having <a href="$(HOME)/devel/buildd/">build daemon</a> redundancy, since the
main alpha machine has been offline for more than ten days.  Martin Schulze <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/01/msg00823.html">added</a>
that the machine was being moved to a new location.  Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2007/01/msg00839.html">answered</a>
that this requirement has been waived as a hard requirement for release
qualification so that this particular outage doesn't affect the release status
of alpha port.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 1252: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2007/dsa-1252">vlc</a> --
