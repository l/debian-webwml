<p>This special supplement to Debian Weekly News is a review of the
most important happenings of 2007 in the Debian community.  This is
certainly not a comprehensive list. The focus is on unusual and

discussions.</p>

<p>As Debian Weekly News enters its ten year, we would like to thank
everybody who contributed to DWN in the past.  Special thanks also go
to the hoard of translators who make DWN available in a dozen
languages.  And finally, thanks to everyone in the Debian community
for providing such a plethora of interesting discussions, events, and
hard work for us to report on.</p>
