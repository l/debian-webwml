<p>Welcome to this year's 32nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Enrico Zini <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00281.html">noticed</a>
that the description for Pike packages contains a long explanation of Pike
which produces erroneous search results, Helmut Wollmersdorfer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg00332.html">added</a>
that PHP packages have similar issues.  Erich Schubert <a
href="http://blog.drinsama.de/erich/en/linux/debian/2006072002-debian-etch-artwork">\
called</a> for artists to design artwork for the <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> release that could be used as the
desktop background.</p>

<p><strong>New SPI Board Officers elected.</strong> David Graham, secretary of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>, Inc. (SPI), <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2006/000136.html">\
announced</a> that during the board meeting on August 1st Bdale Garbee was
elected as president, Michael Schultheiss as vice president, Neil McGovern as
secretary and Josh Berkus as treasurer for the 2006-2007 fiscal year.  The
last three board members have beforehand been <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-announce/2006/000135.html">\
elected</a> to the board by a total of 125 <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/secretary/votes/vote5/results.html">voters</a>
(33&nbsp;% of all eligible voters).</p>

<p><strong>Debian Architectures Statistics.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01325.html">\
reported</a> on the architecture distribution in Debian, as reported
by the <a href="http://popcon.debian.org">popularity contest</a>. He
noted that an increasing number of users are using the <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/arm/">ARM</a> port whereas the <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/alpha/">Alpha</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/sparc/">Sparc</a> ports are losing market share.  Joey
Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/07/msg01362.html">\
suggested</a> that the Linksys NSLU2 machines are a
good reason for this increase in ARM users.  The <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/popularity-contest">\
popularity contest</a> package is also used to decide the number of the installation
CD for a particular package.</p>

<p><strong>New Information Media for Users.</strong> Wolfgang Lonien <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00187.html">\
announced</a> the creation of <a href="http://www.thedebianuser.org">The
Debian User</a>, a website that will aggregate thoughts and comments of
Debian users. The same day, Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00030.html">\
announced</a> the launch of <a
href="http://times.debian.net">DebianTimes</a>, which is intended
to deliver news items to developers and
interested Debian users. DebianTimes is available on the web and as an RSS <a
href="http://times.debian.net/?format=rss20.xml">feed</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Bits from the Stable Release Team.</strong> Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00035.html">\
announced</a> that Dann Frazier became a member of the
Stable Release Team to handle and improve kernel updates.  A new <a
href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/proposed-updates.html">webpage</a> created
by Martin Zobel-Helas is also available to track packages that are waiting to
be accepted for proposed-updates.</p>

<p><strong>Debian adopted in the Extremadura.</strong> The project <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2006/20060803">announced</a> that the local <a
href="http://www.linex.org/">flavour</a> of Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 has been
adopted by the local government of the autonomous region of Extremadura in
Spain.  All workers of the public administration will also use Open Document
Formats for their office applications as well as PDF for document exchange.
Future versions of additional software also need to be distributed under a
free license.</p>

<p><strong>Debian for the Uninitiated.</strong> Lars Wirzenius <a
href="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/log/2006-07.html#20060728c">wondered</a> how
usable Debian with GNOME is for the uninitiated, or more specifically, for
someone who has been using Windows for a number of years, and switches to
Debian.  The experiment will continue for a couple of months.  The first use
went pretty well, with only a couple of real problems which he outlined.</p>

<p><strong>MiniDebconf Colombia.</strong> Santiago Ruano Rinc√≥n <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00002.html">\
announced</a> that there will be a Mini DebConf held at Popayan, Cauca on the
19th and 20th of August.  There will be talks, a hacklab, a bugsquashing party
and so on. The conference is organised through a Wiki <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianColombia/MiniDebconf2006">page</a>. All
interested people are welcome to attend.</p>

<p><strong>Hosting for Debian-related Mailing Lists.</strong> Pascal Hakim <a
href="http://www.redellipse.net/stuff/Debian/teams.debian.net.story">reported</a>
that he has set up <a href="http://teams.debian.net/">teams.debian.net</a>
which aims at providing space for
Debian-related mailing lists and archives, including package lists,
user groups lists and mailing lists for special events.  The service could
also act as a temporary server for testing new mailing lists before
making them official on <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">\
lists.debian.org</a>.  Pascal created a set of <a 
href="http://teams.debian.net/request.html">rules</a>
for using his service.</p>
