<p>Welcome to this year's 27th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Andreas Barth <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/07/msg00002.html">\
announced</a> that four more assistants have been added to the release
team.  There are <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg02581.html">rumours</a>
to start a port of Debian to the recently freed <a
href="http://www.minix3.org/">Minix 3</a> operating system.  Steve Kemp <a
href="http://blog.steve.org.uk/index.php/archives/2006/07/03/at-the-end-of-the-day/">\
noted</a> that he has become a full member of the security team recently which
now consists of four full members.</p>

<p><strong>Python Policy Transition.</strong> Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/06/msg00014.html">\
reported</a> that the infrastructure for the Python <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/packaging-manuals/python-policy/">policy</a> transition is
in place.  The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPython/NewPolicy">\
instructions</a> contain detailed descriptions how to update existing Python
packages.  About 60&nbsp;% of the Python modules have already been updated and only
about 100 packages are left.</p>

<p><strong>Spanish Planet Debian.</strong> David Moreno Garza <a
href="http://www.damog.net/20060629/planeta-debian-en-espanol/">announced</a>
that a <a href="https://planet.debian.org/es/">Spanish variant</a> of the popular
feed aggregator <a href="https://planet.debian.org/">Planet Debian</a> has been
set up on <a href="https://planet.debian.org/es/">planeta.debian.net</a>,
comprising 10 people at the moment.  More people writing about Debian in
Spanish are welcome to be added there.</p>

<p><strong>Five Years of DWN.</strong> Martin 'Joey' Schulze has been <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/~joey/Writing/DWN/">editing</a> the
Debian Weekly News for the last five years. The <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/">DWN</a> is a weekly online edition which
informs about what is going on in the Debian community and
was first <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/1999/1">published</a> in 1999 by
Joey Hess. Many thanks to all the contributors and editors of the last
seven years. If you want to help, please read the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/contributing">contributing page</a> and jump
in!</p>

<p><strong>Package Selections for Debian Live.</strong> Daniel Baumann <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg03044.html">asked</a>
for suggestions for package selections for the three <a
href="http://live.debian.net/">Debian Live</a> CD images to fit the user's
needs best.  The small image will contain only packages of standard priority,
and three larger ones will contain one of the common desktop-environments:
GNOME, KDE, XFCE.</p>

<p><strong>Project Leader Updates.</strong> Steve McIntyre <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/07/msg00000.html">\
reported</a> that a new stable update is expected soon which will contain an
updated <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> for the
first time.  He stated that <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> is still
targeted for release by the end of this year and asked for help.  He also
announced a report about the trip of David Moreno Garza to Cuba.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Flash Group.</strong> Paul Wise <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00021.html">announced</a>
the creation of the Debian <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Flash">flash
group</a> that aims to support the free flash <a href="http://osflash.org/">\
community</a>.  For Debian packages the <a
href="https://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-flash/">pkg-flash</a> project on
Alioth has been started.  Maintainers of flash-related packages are invited to
participate in this and add their packages.</p>

<p><strong>LSB Scripts and multiple Output Lines.</strong> Martin Krafft <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00024.html">wondered</a>
how to implement an init script which is LSB-conforming and also produces
multiple sub-lines of output.  Daniel Jacobowitz <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/06/msg00029.html">suggested</a>
to generate totally independent lines instead.</p>
