# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 21st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Julien Danjou <a
href="http://julien.danjou.info/blog/index.php/2006/04/07/259-netbsd-3-in-xen">\
reported</a> that he has successfully installed NetBSD 3 inside the new Xen 3
virtual machine monitor available in Debian unstable.  Eric Dorland <a
href="http://ze-dinosaur.livejournal.com/7036.html">explained</a> the creation
of library packages with debugging capabilities.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical Debian Installer Images.</strong> Frans Pop <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/05/msg00734.html">reported</a>
that the graphical <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/GUI">\
installer</a> is part of the regular daily built <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">images</a> for the i386 platform with
AMD and PowerPC following soon.  To use the new installer the boot argument
"<code>installgui</code>" or "<code>expertgui</code>" has to be used.  Frans
Pop <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2006/05/msg00503.html">\
explained</a> that the graphical installer could be the default in the release
after <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Sun Java distributed by Debian.</strong> Jeroen van Wolffelaar <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00010.html">\
announced</a> the availability of Sun's <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/libs/sun-java5-jre">Java</a> package
in the non-free section of Debian after Sun has <a
href="http://www.sun.com/smi/Press/sunflash/2006-05/sunflash.20060516.4.xml">\
reworked</a> their license.  Debian still remains committed to supporting free
runtime and development environments for Java, such as <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/kaffe">Kaffe</a> and <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gcj">GCJ</a>.  Red Hat, however, <a
href="http://www.regdeveloper.co.uk/2006/05/18/red_hat_sun_java_license/">\
complained</a> that this is not free enough and that Sun should free their virtual
machine (JVM) at least.</p>

<p><strong>DebConf6 successfully finished.</strong> The 6th <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2006/0514-debconf">Debian Conference</a>,
which was held last week in Mexico, has ended.  Many thanks go to the <a
href="http://debconf6.debconf.org/">sponsors</a> and the organisation
team, who made this great Debian event possible.  A lot of
<a href="https://gallery.debconf.org/debconf6">photos</a> were taken and in
about four weeks a DVD with all talks will be available.</p>

<p><strong>Splitting Changelog Files.</strong> Nico Golde <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01098.html">wondered</a>
about the proper way to handle large and old debian changelog files when they
are edited quite often and grew very large.  The predominant <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/03/msg01144.html">opinion</a>
is to keep the entire file as it contains information about why and when bugs
have been fixed.  Since it is compressed in the package, the space consumption
is usually acceptable.</p>

<p><strong>Project Leader Report.</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/05/msg00009.html">\
encouraged</a> everybody to think about ways the Debian project could help
organisations that would like to be partners to cooperate better with Debian.
He pondered about a social contract for partners and is seeking input.  He
also reported about the large number of sponsors for this year's Debian
Conference and the participation in Google's <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/">Summer of Code</a>.</p>
