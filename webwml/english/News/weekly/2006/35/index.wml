<p>Welcome to this year's 35th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Bug squashing parties have been announced for September 8th
to 10th in <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00012.html">\
Vienna</a> and for September 15th to 17th in <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00013.html">\
Jülich</a>, Germany.  OSDir has taken <a
href="http://shots.osdir.com/slideshows/slideshow.php?release=724&amp;slide=2">\
screenshots</a> of the new graphical <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">\
Debian installer</a>.  Petr Stehlik <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2006/08/msg00234.html">reported</a>
that the installation of <a href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/">sarge</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> worked flawlessly in the recently <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-68k/2006/08/msg00226.html">fixed</a>
version of <a href="https://packages.debian.org/aranym">ARAnyM</a>, a 32bit
Atari ST/TT/Falcon virtual machine.</p>

<p><strong>General Resolution: Handling Firmware.</strong> Steve Langasek <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/08/msg00032.html">proposed</a>
a general resolution to establish how DFSG#2 should be understood to apply to
firmware, especially when distributed with the Linux kernel.  When accepted
firmware will be considered as data without the requirement of matching source
code.  It would also clarify the situation for other works such as images,
video, and fonts.</p>

<p><strong>FrOSCon Report.</strong> Joey Schulze <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2006/0624-froscon-report">reported</a> about the Debian
presence at the first <a href="$(HOME)/events/2006/0624-froscon">Free and Open
Source Software Conference</a> in Sankt Augustin, Germany.  The Debian project
successfully maintained a one-day <a
href="http://wiki.snow-crash.org/FrosCon06">conference</a> and ran a booth in
the exhibition area.  This community event featured both official tracks and
sub-conferences maintained by several projects.  Alexander Wirt also managed
to get some pretzels that looked like Debian swirls.</p>

<p><strong>Event Coordination Meeting Report.</strong> Meike Reichle <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/08/msg00080.html">summarised</a>
the main results of the event coordination <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity/2006/08/msg00031.html">meeting</a>.
Several ideas were collected during the meeting how Debian booth
participations and talks could be improved to make them more attractive to
visitors.  To help the booth organisers there are new <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEventsFaqs">FAQ</a> and <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEventsHowto">Howto</a> Wiki pages.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and Free Software in Cuba.</strong> David Moreno
Garza wrote a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/08/msg00010.html">\
report</a> about his visit to Cuba as a representative of the Debian
project. A workshop on package creation and maintenance and talks about
Custom Debian Distributions, internationalisation and localisation were
organised by David and Maykel Moya at the Mathematics and Computing
Faculty in the University of Havana.</p>

<p><strong>Translation of Package Descriptions.</strong>
Martijn van Oosterhout <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n/2006/08/msg00030.html">announced</a>
that he wrote a system that can send and receive e-mails from the <a
href="http://ddtp2.debian.net/">Debian Description Translation Project</a>
and provides a web <a href="http://kleptog.org/cgi-bin/ddtss2-cgi/xx">\
frontend</a> where translating actually takes place.
The most important advantage over the pure e-mail interface is that this
additional system provides a review mechanism for translations.</p>

<p><strong>GIT Transition Plans.</strong> Ian Beckwith <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/08/msg00351.html">explained</a>
that <code>/usr/bin/git</code> will be maintained via alternatives.  Both <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/git">GNU Interactive Tools</a> and Linus
Torvalds' source code management system <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/git-core">git</a> provide the same program
name.  The GNU interactive tools have been renamed into <code>gitfm</code> to
resolve this conflict and in etch will contain a wrapper that is able to
execute the other program.</p>

<p><strong>Updates for Debian Sarge.</strong> Martin Zobel-Helas <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2006/08/msg00300.html">announced</a>
the <a href="https://release.debian.org/stable/3.1/3.1r3/">preparations</a>
done for the next stable update.  It will include an updated version of the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">Debian Installer</a> to reflect the
recent kernel changes introduced by the last round of kernel <a
href="$(HOME)/security/">security updates</a>.  Most other packages are
updated to incorporate the security corrections that have accumulated.</p>

<p><strong>New Features in Etch.</strong> Alexander Schmehl <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/08/msg00125.html">\
started</a> to collect new <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/NewInEtch">features</a> that Debian will probably
include in the upcoming <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> release.
Nathanael Nerode additionally <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/08/msg00167.html">noted</a>
that systems upgraded from <a href="$(HOME)/releases/sarge/">sarge</a> don't
see the benefits of certain changes in the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">installer</a> such as special tuning of
the Ext2 filesystem.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
