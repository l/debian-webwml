<p>Welcome to this year's 10th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  If you are in doubt about the proper distribution for
you, try the <a
href="http://www.zegeniestudios.net/ldc/index.php?firsttime=true">Linux
distribution chooser</a>.  Manoj Srivastava <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/03/msg00074.html">called</a>
for <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2006/vote_001">votes</a> on the General Resolution
to address the Debian project's position on the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
a second time.  Ballots can be casted until March 11th.</p>

<p><strong>Requirements and Rights for Sub-Projects.</strong> Martin Michlmayr
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/03/msg00004.html">\
started</a> a discussion on requirements and rights for official Debian <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/#projects">sub-projects</a>.  He asked in particular if a
sub-projects may handle their own finances and ask for donations if they
have special needs such as <a href="http://www.debonaras.org/">\
Debonaras</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian/kFreeBSD for AMD64.</strong> Robert Millan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-amd64/2006/03/msg00017.html">announced</a>
the availability of an experimental base Debian GNU/kFreeBSD system for the
amd64 architecture.  It uses the GNU C library ported by Petr Salinger and
requires a running version of FreeBSD 6.0 on amd64 and works only as chroot
environment.  Aurelien Jarno <a href="http://blog.aurel32.net/?p=25">\
added</a> a note about the setup of a build daemon for this system.</p>

<p><strong>Subscribing to new CDD Packages?</strong> Enrico Zini <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-custom/2006/03/msg00001.html">reported</a>
about an idea to create a mechanism that will allow users to receive new
packages for their custom Debian distribution (CDD) when they are properly
tagged for this particular suite.  A solution still needs to be found to mark
packages for installation, though.</p>

<p><strong>IRC Debate for the Project Leader Election.</strong> Thaddeus Black
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00001.html">\
announced</a> the live debate of this year's project leader candidates on
IRC.  The debate will be moderated by Don Armstrong and take place on
Thursday, 16 March 2006 from 22:30 UTC to 01:00 UTC on #debian-dpl-debate on
irc.debian.org.  He asked for volunteers for the panel and questions to be
asked the candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Backports officially.</strong> Joseph Smidt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01403.html">wondered</a>
if <a href="http://backports.org/">backports</a> will ever be officially
supported by Debian.  Norbert Tretkowski <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01414.html">explained</a>
that it may be possible to provide some official backports in the future but
quite unlikely to make all packages from backports.org official.</p>

<p><strong>QA Activities List.</strong> Lars Wirzenius <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/02/msg00033.html">asked</a> if
there exists a list of what QA activities are being performed as he
contemplates to help but not duplicate the effort of others.  Such a list is
composed within the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/qa%2edebian%2eorg/activities">Wiki</a> for easier
maintenance.  Jeroen van Wolffelaar additionally <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa/2006/02/msg00042.html">asked</a> for
help maintaining the <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">qa.debian.org</a>
website.</p>

<p><strong>DPL Campaigning Summaries.</strong> David Schmitt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/03/msg00056.html">announced</a>
that he is producing a <a
href="http://debian.edv-bus.at/vote-2006/questions.html">summary</a> of the
questions asked and answers given by the 2006 project leader <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2006/vote_002">candidates</a> during the election campaign.
The summary will be updated as questions are asked and answers published.</p>

<p><strong>New packages.debian.org Host.</strong> The Debian project <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/03/msg00004.html">\
announced</a> the re-availability of the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/">packages.debian.org</a> service on a new
machine.  The system has been donated by <a
href="http://www.schlund.de/">Schlund + Partner</a> where it is hosted
as well.  It is a Dual-Core Opteron and only runs this service for Debian users
and developers.</p>

<p><strong>Checking Build Logs.</strong> Samuel Thibault <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01546.html">\
demonstrated</a> that missing function declarations can cause problems in
running systems and proposed to add compiler flags that will cause the build
to fail when a function is not declared.  Kurt Roeckx <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01550.html">added</a>
more problematic programming errors that should be taken care of.  Steve
Greenland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg01555.html">stated</a>
that there is no excuse for these bugs since they are easy to fix.</p>
