<p>Welcome to this year's 5th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Martin Michlmayr <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2006/01/msg00063.html">reported</a>
about two development MIPS boards donated to Debian that will be used as build daemon
for the MIPS architectures.  Stephen Shankland <a
href="http://news.com.com/Defender+of+the+GPL/2008-1082_3-6028495.html">reported</a>
about Eben Moglen who is explaining the updated <a
href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/">version</a> of the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU GPL</a> which <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00394.html">resulted</a>
in <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2006/01/msg00427.html">\
discussions</a> on Debian lists.</p>

<p><strong>Call for Papers.</strong> Margarita Manterola <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00014.html">\
called</a> for papers for the upcoming <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debianday/">Debian Day</a> which will take place
on Saturday, May 13th, before this years <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2006/0514-debconf">DebConf</a> in Oaxtepec, Mexico.  The
presentations should be easy to understand, very clear and concise in their
content, and not require any previous knowledge about Debian from the
audience.</p>

<p><strong>Process to remove debmake.</strong> Santiago Vila <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01428.html">reported</a>
about the demise of <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debmake">debmake</a>.
One year ago, the use of <code>debmake</code> for new packages was deprecated
and the included program <code>deb-make</code> removed.  The next steps are
switching away from this tool and eventually opening release-critical bug
reports against remaining <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01435.html">\
packages</a>.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01446.html">\
suggested</a> to file wishlist bugs now with a proper usertag.</p>

<p><strong>More volunteer Contributions.</strong> Joseph Michael Smidt <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00004.html">stated</a>
that all people want to feel important when they're making a contribution to
Debian.  He would like to see an official title for all contributers so they
become a visible part of the community, especially since the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/join/">new-maintainer</a> process could be seen as a
barrier.  The following discussion demonstrated several means to get
involved.</p>

<p><strong>New Semantic of /var/run.</strong> Peter Eisentraut <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00223.html">forwarded</a>
a user <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/344758">request</a> to create a
directory within <code>/var/run</code> upon service startup.  Henrique
Holschuh <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00234.html">\
suggested</a> to go ahead since <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/initscripts">initscripts</a> are leaning
towards an ephemeral <code>/var/run</code> that will be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00241.html">removed</a>
upon reboot.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Archive Key Maintenance.</strong> Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00225.html">noticed</a>
problems upgrading <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/">etch</a> due to a missing
new archive key.  Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00311.html">pondered</a>
whether could result in a stable Debian release being uninstallable.  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00368.html">\
Distributing</a> updated keys in a security update would <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00369.html">break</a>
past policies concerning stable releases and users won't be able to install the
current stable release without the update.</p>

<p><strong>Launchpad for Debian?</strong> Frans Jessop <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00349.html">asked</a> if
it would be helpful, more organised and efficient if Debian developers would
work with <a href="http://launchpad.net/">launchpad</a>.  Matthew Garrett <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00351.html">pointed
out</a> that the general use is unlikely as long as it is not Free Software.
Andrew Suffield <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2006/01/msg00391.html">added</a>
that removing the ability to manage things from the shell doesn't improve
efficiency.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li>DSA 954: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-954">wine</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
<li>DSA 955: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-955">mailman</a> --
    Denial of service.
<li>DSA 956: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-956">lsh-utils</a> --
    Local vulnerabilities.
<li>DSA 957: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-957">imagemagick</a> --
    Arbitrary command execution.
<li>DSA 958: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-958">drupal</a> --
    Several vulnerabilities.
<li>DSA 959: <a href="$(HOME)/security/2006/dsa-959">unalz</a> --
    Arbitrary code execution.
</ul>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> Due to <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/">packages.debian.org</a> being down because
of performance issues we are unable to provide the regular list of new
packages.</p>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages.</strong> 2 packages were orphaned this week and
require a new maintainer.  This makes a total of 197 orphaned packages.  Many
thanks to the previous maintainers who contributed to the Free Software
community.  Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">WNPP pages</a> for
the full list, and please add a note to the bug report and retitle it to ITA:
if you plan to take over a package.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/electronics/ivi">ivi</a>
     -- Graphical front-end for various HDL simulators.
     (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/350149">Bug#350149</a>)
     </li>
<li> <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/ud">ud</a>
     -- Uptime Daemon.

newsletter.  We still need more volunteer writers who watch the Debian
community and report about what is going on.  Please see the <a
