<p><b>Mate 1.14 in Unstable</b></p>

<p>Mike Gabriel <a href="https://sunweavers.net/blog/node/42">announced</a> 
MATE 1.14 was landing in unstable, with builds for the 23 architectures 
supported by Debian. Mike notes that the greatest change is the switch from GTK2 to 
GTK3 and that there are some known issues such as when running in an NXv3-based
remote desktop session. The team thanks all those who helped getting MATE into
Debian.</p>

<p><b>Misc Developer News</b></p>

<p>Julien Cristau posted <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/06/msg00002.html">
Misc Developer News #41</a>. Highlights include the new 
debhelper compat 10 being ready for testing, source packages now being able to include
upstream signatures, a change to Apt allowing the use of <q>by-hash</q> to avoid hashsum
mismatches, minor mirror changes to help the Debian Mirrors network, the
<q>stretch-debug</q> suite now being populated, and the package init losing
its status as Essential and required, so that it can be left out of minimal chroots.</p>

<p><b>Point releases</b></p>

<p>Debian <q>wheezy</q>
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2016/2016060402">7.11</a>: the eleventh and
final update of oldstable Debian 7 (codename <q>wheezy</q>) was released on 4 June 2016.</p>
<p>Debian <q>jessie</q>
<a href="$(HOME)/News/2016/20160604">8.5</a>: the fifth
update of stable Debian 8 (codename <q>jessie</q>) was also released on 4 June 2016.</p>

<p><b>Changes in the New Member process</b></p>

<p>Enrico Zini <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/06/msg00003.html">highlights</a> some changes to the New Member process along with a guide 
to the application process. The <a href="https://nm.debian.org">nm.debian.org</a> site now offers managed self-service for 
most of the steps, which should aid applicants and advocates to provide input and 
information and make it easier for Account Managers and Debian Developers to provide input.</p>
<p>These changes help move the NM process forward in several areas, especially
helping Debian Account Managers and Front Desk members to concentrate on
reviewing and deciding on applications.</p>

<p><b>Wheezy LTS and the switch to OpenJDK 7</b></p>

<p>Markus Koschany followed up on the earlier <a href="$(HOME)/News/2016/20160425">announcement of support</a> 
and changes for Wheezy LTS. He gave more background information to the
decision to <a href="http://java.debian.net/blog/2016/06/wheezy-lts-and-the-switch-to-openjdk-7.html">switch from OpenJDK 6 to OpenJDK 7 in Wheezy LTS</a>, a move prompted by
the end of life of Ubuntu 12.04 which uses OpenJDK 6. The switch took into 
consideration choosing a default for a stable release cycle, the impact that it 
would have on users, and questioning the need of supporting JDK6 for a short 12 
month period of time in contrast to the length of the LTS timeline.</p>

<p><b>Bits from the DPL</b></p>

<p>Debian Project Leader Mehdi Dogguy <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/06/msg00008.html">shared news</a> of his activities and happenings inside of the project.
He announced changes made to the Newmaint delegation, notes on attending DebConf16 and
Sun Camp, appointments to the Anti-Harassment team, a review of reimbursement 
procedures, and asset purchases.</p>

<p><b>GCC 6 and binutils for the Debian stretch release</b></p>
<p>Matthias Klose
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/06/msg00007.html">announced
GCC 6 will be the default</a> GNU Compiler Collection  
for stretch. GCC 6 is available in testing and can be currently made the 
default on systems by installing the gcc/g++ packages from experimental. 
Matthias highlighted known build failures, and plans for release. Packages
using previous GCC versions will become release critical for the next 
release.</p>
<p>binutils will be moving from a 12 month release cycle to a 6 month release 
cycle; expect binutils 2.27 or later for stretch.</p>

<p><b>New pkg-security team</b></p>

<p>Gianfranco Costamagna <a 
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/06/msg00259.html">announced a 
new pkg-security team</a> which will focus on providing a list of security 
tools maintained by downstream distributions, and merging them back into Debian. The

<p><b>DebConf16 - The annual Debian Developers Conference</b></p>

<p>Each year the Debian community of Contributors, Developers, and software 
enthusiasts meets for an annual Conference known as <a href="https://debconf.org/">DebConf</a>. 
This year was the 16th conference, along with its precursor hacking session
DebCamp which was held 23 June through 1 July 2016.</p>

<p>The conference location for this year was Cape Town, South Africa, the venue 
was the University of Cape Town (UCT), and the event was hosted by the Engineering Faculty 
and the Department of Computer Sciences.</p>

<p><a href="http://debconf16.debconf.org/">DebConf16</a> officially started 2 
July and ended 9 July 2016 with over 280 people attending from all over the 
world.</p>

<p>As Debian is a worldwide community, for those unable to attend, 113 hours 
of talks in 114 events, BOFs (<q>Birds of a Feather</q> discussions), and sessions were recorded 
and live streamed. A special nod of appreciation to the Video team who reviewed 
sessions as soon as they were recorded and set up a system to publish the videos 
automatically; videos may be seen at the
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/debconf16/">Debian
meetings archive website</a>.</p>

<p>We hope to provide a fuller report of the DebConf16 experience, but as of 
now most of the attendees are still recovering and blogging about their times 
and experiences, so please stay tuned.</p>

<li><p><b>Debian activities in FISL17</b></p>

<p>
During the 17th edition of the International Free Software Forum (FISL17) held 
from 13 July through 16 July at PUCRS in Porto Alegre, Brazil, the Debian
project's late founder, Ian Murdock, received a great tribute, in which one of the stages of the
event received his name. At the official opening this announcement was 
greeted with a warm round of applause. More details are available in the news 
published on the
<a href="http://softwarelivre.org/fisl17/noticias/comunidade-debian-brasil-fala-sobre-o-legado-de-ian-murdock">
event website (in Portuguese)</a>.</p>

<p>The Brazilian Debian community held various activities during FISL17: 
6 Lightning Talks on various topics such as Forensics, BTS, Debian Policy, and
GSoC. There were also workshops on packaging, the Web of Trust, and a 
community meeting. The main theme of this meeting was to present the
various work fronts and ways of contribution to the community and to attract new
contributors. All activities of the Debian community in Brazil can be seen <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/br/2016/EncontroComunitarioFISL">here</a>.</p>

<p>As has happened in previous years, the event had exhibition stands for the
communities; this space was very important and served as a meeting between
members of the Debian community. During the four-day event promotional materials 
were distributed, and many people sought out the exhibition stand to learn more
about the Debian community. Others participated in the Install Fest. Some
<a href="http://softwarelivre.org/debianbrasil/debian-no-fisl17">photos</a> of the event.</p>

<p>Debian Brazil community continues its focus to have a continuous presence in 
one of the greatest Free Software events in the world, showing the work done 
and inviting more people to collaborate with the <q>Universal Operating System</q>.</p>

<p>Debian user Gene Heskett asked <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2016/06/msg00462.html">how to fix his Iceweasel/Firefox icon and binary mixup</a>... and
started one of the largest threads in -user. The discussion covered firefox
binaries, what synaptic actually installs and where it installs it to, email
etiquette and code of conduct, and the resurfacing of <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=815006">bug &#35;815006</a> and great news.</p>

<p>Debian user Lisi Reisz posted <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2016/06/msg01153.html">"Catastrophe
- but how? Aptitude goes mad"</a>, when a simple aptitude install instead 
uninstalled everything. The thread gives the recovery, solution and some history on GREP, as
well as notes on when to use and when to never use aptitude vs. apt-get.</p>

<p>On the Debian Developers list Steve McIntyre pondered the usefulness of a 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2016/07/msg00054.html"><q>Jessie
and a half</q> release</a>. Although the name is not set, the discussion on what
to include in this release starts off with a backports-kernel, a rebuilt Debian 
Installer, X drivers, xserver, and other packages. Thoughts are many arm64, 
recent amd64, and ppc64el ports would benefit from this release and its net
install image.</p>

<p>
Simon Désaulnier started his
<a href="http://sim590.github.io/post/gsoc/intro/">introduction</a> to GSoC by
sharing his focus of work on improving distributed and secure communication
using free software. Simon will be working on OpenDHT, a component of <a 
href="https://ring.cx/">Ring</a>, a secure and distributed voice, video and chat 
communication platform. OpenDHT is the distributed hash table which allows Ring 
to keep communications and the platform decentralised.</p>
<p>Simon's roadmap for the project starts with new OpenDHT functionality, 
maintenance, and data optimisation.</p>
<p><a href="http://sim590.github.io/post/gsoc/week1/">Week 1</a> started with  
serialisable structure for remote filtering which allows for expanded sql 
like queries.</p>
<p><a href="http://sim590.github.io/post/gsoc/week2/">Week 2</a> Simon fixed a 
bug issues with a <a 
href="https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/issues/72">Packaging issue for 
Python bindings</a> and for <a 
href="https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/opendht/pull/73">dht: consider IPv4 
or IPv6 disconnected on operation done</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://sim590.github.io/post/gsoc/week34/">Week 3 and 4</a> Simon 
worked on the final version of the queries code library, work now focuses on 
Value pagination including a redesign of some of the operation callbacks, and 
optimising announce operations.</p>
