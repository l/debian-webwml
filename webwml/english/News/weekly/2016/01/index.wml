<toc-add-entry name="newdpn">Welcome to the <q>New</q> Debian Project News!</toc-add-entry>

<p>We hope that you have enjoyed our newly revised format of the DPN. We have shifted
some of the content around, introduced new sections, and moved some content
onto the <a href="https://bits.debian.org/">Bits from Debian</a> blog.</p>

<p>Bits from Debian will showcase new packages and interviews, plus some announcements,
and is where we will welcome new DDs.</p>

<p>We are planning to send more short news items via our social network account.
Please be sure to follow us on <a href="https://identi.ca/debian">identi.ca/debian</a>
(or fall back to the non-official mirrors in other social networks).</p>

<p>One of the major changes is the removal of the DSA security advisories from
the newsletter. Debian's Security Team releases current advisories on a daily
basis (<a href="$(HOME)/security/2016/">Security Advisories 2016</a>), so
please read them carefully and take the proper measures.</p>

<p>If you need to be kept up to date about security advisories released by the
Debian Security Team, please
subscribe to the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">security mailing
list</a> (and the separate <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-backports-announce/">backports
list</a>, <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-stable-announce/">stable updates
list</a>, and <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/">long term
support security updates list</a>) for announcements.
</p>

<p>We are simplifying and (we hope) improving the <q>help needed</q> section.
From now on, you will find:</p>

<ul>
<li>links to packages needing help, </li>
<li>links to bug reports tagged <q>newcomer</q>,</li>
<li>calls for help from teams in coordination with the Welcome Team,
tailored for first-time contributors.</li>
</ul>

## Start of the actual news

<toc-add-entry name="internal">Internal News/Happenings</toc-add-entry>

<p><b>Updated Debian 8: 8.3 released</b></p>

<p>The third update of Debian 8 'jessie' was 
<a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2016/20160123">released</a> last month, addressing 
security concerns in the stable release along with updates.</p>


<p><b>Debtags cleaned up</b></p>

<p>Enrico Zini <a 
href="http://www.enricozini.org/2016/debian/debtags-cleanup/">announced</a> a 
cleanup to debtags.debian.org. Changes were made to anonymous submissions, 
the recognition of tags as official contributions, and mailing lists.</p>


<p><b>Remembering Ian</b></p>

<p>
As we are all aware Debian mourned the loss of its founder Ian Murdock.
For the month of January most Debian services and outward-facing visual elements
kept with a darkened theme and ribbon in remembrance. 
Slowly into this month we are changing the websites and services back 
to their original themes and colours. 
</p>

<p>
The Debian Publicity Team is preparing a website that will gather many 
of the blogposts, messages, and contributions made by community members and the
wider free software mourning Ian, as well as the tribute video shown on 30 January 2016 in
the session <a href="https://fosdem.org/2016/schedule/event/ian_murdock/"><q>Ian
Murdock, in memoriam</q></a> at FOSDEM (the Free, Open Source Developers European Meeting). 
It will be announced soon in  
<a href="https://bits.debian.org">bits.debian.org</a>, the Debian blog. 
</p>

<p>
We thank you all for grieving with us and for all these contributions, 
and we hope these gestures have been able to speak to the community.
</p>

<p><b>New Debian Pure Blends section in the website</b></p>
<p>
Iain R. Learmonth together with the different Blend Teams is updating and reorganising
the information about Debian Pure Blends in our website. Thanks!
We all hope you like this <a href="https://www.debian.org/blends/">new section about Pure Blends</a>, 
which is also listed in the homepage menu of www.debian.org.
</p>

<p><b>Tails installer is now in Debian</b></p>

<p>The Tails Installer is now in Debian, thanks to the 
Debian Privacy Tools Maintainers Team.
</p>
<p>
The Amnesic Incognito Live System (Tails) is a live OS based on 
Debian GNU/Linux which aims at preserving the user's privacy and 
anonymity. 
</p>
<p>
The previous process for getting started with Tails was very complex,
but now it can now be done simply by installing Tails Installer 
in your existing Debian system, using sid, stretch or jessie-backports,
and plugging in a USB stick.
</p>
<p>
Read more about this news in 
<a href="https://bits.debian.org/2016/02/tails-installer-in-debian.html">this
article in the Debian blog</a>.
</p>

<p><b>DSA and service maintainers encrypting all the things</b></p>

<p>
Let's Encrypt, the free, automated, and open Certificate Authority
went Public Beta in December 2015, and packages containing several utilities
to create and install these certificates have already entered Debian unstable and testing.
 </p>

<p>
Let's Encrypt is now enabling the Debian System Administrators (DSA) team
to expand its deployment of encryption for debian.org services,
which started a few years ago with friendly help from Gandi.
</p>
<p>
Thanks to the DSA, we can now communicate with these Debian services using secure channels:

debtags.debian.org, metadata.ftp-master.debian.org, several syncproxies,
planet-search.debian.org, cgi.debian.org, www-master.debian.org,
search.debian.org, i18n.debian.org, and l10n.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to their maintainers, these other Debian services are also secured:

codesearch.debian.net, sources.debian.net, lava.debian.net, jenkins.debian.net,
timeline.debian.net, dedup.debian.net, news.debian.net (static copy),
debaday.debian.net (static copy), plus several debconf.org sites.
</p>

<p>And the work of deploying certificates is still ongoing!</p>

<p><b>Miscellaneous</b></p>

<p>Neil McGovern writes <q><a

sharing his insight on the process 
and discussion around compatible licensing in Debian.</p>

<p><b>Upcoming Events</b></p>

<ul>
<li>

<p>miniDebConf: Curitiba</p>

<p>The Brazilian community of users and Debian developers invites everyone to 
participate in the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianEvents/br/2016/MiniDebconfCuritiba/TextoDPN">Mini-DebConf Curitiba 2016</a> 
that will be held on March 5&ndash;6 at Aldeia Coworking in Curitiba - Parana.</p>

<p>The Mini-DebConf is open to all comers, regardless of their level of knowledge about
or in Debian. Most importantly we want to gather the community to celebrate 
the biggest Free Software project in the world, so we want to welcome users 
of all levels from inexperienced to official Debian Developers.</p>

<p>The program will consist of basic and intermediate level lectures for those 
participants who will have their first contact with Debian or want to know more 
about certain subjects, and intermediate and advanced level workshops for Debian 
users who want to get their hands dirty during the meeting.</p>

<p>The subscription to the Mini-DebConf 2016 Curitiba is completely free of 
charge and can be made using the form available on the meeting website. Prior 
registration is important for us to plan it according to the number of 
participants.</p>

</li>
<li>

<p>miniDebConf: Singapore</p>

<p>At <a href="http://2016.fossasia.org/">FOSSASIA</a>, Debian Singapore users
will make use of generously offered space to hold a <a 
href="https://wiki.debian.org/FOSSASIA/MiniDebConf2016">miniDebConf</a> March 
18&ndash;20 2016 at the Singapore Science Centre. Multiple events are already
planned including a Debian &#38; Friends Meetup where new users and those interested 
in Debian can gather, several talks and workshops, a bug squashing party, and 
other events. With enough participation and attendees Debian may occupy a larger 
space and may be able to hold a Sprint. This event is still in the <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2016/02/msg00002.html">planning phases</a> and open to volunteers and suggestions. There is a 
community ticket of SGD35 which includes lunches and a T-shirt.</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p>You can find more information about how to sponsor Debian-related events 
and talks on the <a href="$(HOME)/events">events section</a> of the Debian website.

<p><b>Discussions</b></p>

<p>While the world focused on the finding of gravitational waves, a savvy Daniel 
Pocock noticed something else when he asked, <q><a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2016/02/msg00021.html">does
Debian help detect gravitational waves?</a></q> Discussion brings to light
some of the efforts of several Debian teams focused on making Debian (and its Blends) 
a better tool for researchers and scientific endeavours.</p>

<p>David Niklas asked a simple yet very serious question in debian-user that we 
can all understand and possibly comment on when he asked,
<q><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2016/02/msg00274.html">is this 
keyboard worth $220?</a></q></p>

<p><b>Tips and Tricks</b></p>

<p>Matthieu Caneill wrote a quick and easy <a href="http://matthieu.io/blog/2015/08/16/one-liner-to-catch-em-all/">one-liner 
to open the source code</a> of any file on your Debian system; this marvel of
code was further modified by Orestis Loannou who tweaked it to use the 
<a href="http://oioannou.com/2016/blog/one-liner/">debsources API to determine 
a license</a>.</p>

<p>For the security minded, Petter Reinholdtsen shares a means of

<p><b>LTS status/updates</b></p>

<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20140424">Squeeze-LTS</a> (Long Term 
Support) for Debian 6.0 'squeeze' will end in February of 2016 (this month). 
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">LTS</a> is handled by a growing community of volunteers, organisations, and
sponsors who work toward keeping a stable operating system in place with
support, security, and packages for an extended duration past new releases. LTS
for squeeze ran for 2 years. Look for an announcement soon from the LTS team
reporting on the end of support and the move to support Debian 7.0 'wheezy'.</p>

<p>Freexian reported on its sponsored Debian Long Term Support. December of 2015
detailed 113.5 work hours distributed to 9 paid contributors, the loss and
reduction of 2 sponsors and the addition of 1 new sponsor. Freexian is starting to
look to the future as LTS begins support for wheezy LTS which will include
packages that were excluded from squeeze LTS. Debian LTS is a critical area that
really needs help, support, and contributions; if you can assist or know of a
company that is willing to become a sponsor please reach out to the team.</p>
