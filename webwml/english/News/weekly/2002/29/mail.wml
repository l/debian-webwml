<p>Hi,</p>

<p>An article from packetstorm.linuxsecurity.org (packetstorm mirror) says:</p>

<p>PubSoft - <a href="http://www.pubsoft.org/">http://www.pubsoft.org/</a></p>

<p>PubSoft is a nonprofit charity that funds open source software development
by allowing patrons who are spending personal money to pay people to write
free software to get a tax deduction for it. The general effect is that it
doubles the amount of money available for an open source project since the
people who can afford to support this are in high tax brackets.</p>

<p>I recently posted quite a long list of what I think are interesting
goals/discussion items in debian-user, but I cannot see the thread in the
archives yet and I'm not subscribed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the excellent work you're doing with the DWN.</p>
