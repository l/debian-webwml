# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's twentieth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.  According to this <a
href="https://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/update_excuses.html">list of
excuses</a>, which says "Gimme an F, gimme an R, gimme an E, E, Z, E. What
does it spell?", it looks like Woody entered the next step.  Not all of you
will know this, but Bdale Garbee is a ham, and as such he will deliver the
keynote at <a href="http://www.tapr.org/tapr/dayton/">Dayton Hamvention
Activities</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BTS Redesign Underway.</strong> On the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-debbugs/">debian-debbugs</a> list
people are discussing a redesign of Debian's <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/">Bug Tracking System</a> (BTS).  Manoj
Srivastava is working on a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/bugtracking.txt">design
document</a>, which will be kept up-to-date.  It contains goals,
boundaries, interfaces and use cases.  If you are missing a certain
feature, please drop Manoj a line at <a
href="mailto:srivasta@debian.org">srivasta@debian.org</a>.

<p><strong>Update for DebConf 2.</strong> Debian Conference 2 (DebConf) will
be held at York University in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, from July 5th - 7th,
2002.  Joe Drew, who took the burden of organizing this year's DebConf, sent in
an <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0205/msg00002.html">\
update report</a>.  More than 100 people, including more than 25 Debian
developers, have already signed up for the conference.  Due to York University
requirements, the last day you can <a href="http://net2.com/debconf2/">sign
up</a> for Debconf and stay at the university is May 31, 2002.  If you don't
make this deadline you can still attend, but you won't be able to have the
arrangements made through Joe and his crew.</p>

<p><strong>Woody DVDs Working Fine.</strong> Steve McIntyre sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0205/msg00136.html">success report</a>
for the Woody DVD.  He tested the ones he created from a local mirror on
several random machines around his office, including a Thinkpad, a small Dell
server box and some older self-built machines. All seem to work fine with the
Isolinux code and will load up to the installation system just fine.</p>

<p><strong>Proposed Java Policy.</strong> Ola Lundqvist <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-policy-0205/msg00114.html">believes</a>
that since Woody is almost released, it is time discuss the maturity of the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~opal/java/policy.html/">proposed Java
policy</a>.  Please comment on the proposal and send your opinion to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-java/">debian-java</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Installation of Debian through a USB Floppy Drive.</strong> Gernot
Weber <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0205/msg00157.html">\
wondered</a> how he could manage to install Debian with a USB-Floppy. The
rescue disk booted but the installer couldn't find the root-disk after
changing.  Werner Heuser <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-laptop-0205/msg00158.html">pointed
out</a> that a special boot option may be required in order to make Linux
recognize the floppy drive.  If this doesn't work one could still try another
installation method as described in the <a
href="http://mobilix.org/Mobile-Guide.db/Mobile-Guide.html">\
Linux-Mobile-Guide</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian for Hams.</strong> A new subproject was created: <a
href="http://debianham.sunsite.dk/">Debian-Ham</a>, a distribution for
Hamradio operators.  SunSITE.dk <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hams-0205/msg00006.html">provides</a> a
CVS repository, a MySQL database and several mailing lists.  Joop Stakenborg
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hams-0205/msg00016.html">explained</a>
that this effort is not an attempt to create a distribution fork and continues
with reasons why a subproject seems to be useful and when the idea came
up.</p>

<p><strong>Hurd within Bochs?</strong> Neil Levine <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0205/msg00131.html">wondered</a> if
the Hurd would run in Bochs (an IA-32 (x86) PC emulator) and Robert Millan
replied with appropriate net resources.  Alfred Szmidt wrote a fine <a
href="ftp://walfield.org/pub/people/ams/hurd/creating_bochs_image_for_gnu.txt">\
tutorial</a> about creating a GNU/Hurd image that can be used with Bochs.  An
image shall be uploaded to the <a
href="http://bochs.sourceforge.net/diskimages.html">list</a> of disk images
with pre-installed systems.</p>

<p><strong>Formation of SGML/XML Policy Group.</strong> Mark Johnson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-sgml-0205/msg00000.html">started</a> to
form an SGML/XML policy group.  It should compose a new Debian policy for
packaging, implementation, etc., of XML, SGML, and related stuff.  Adam
Di Carlo and Mark started writing up a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~mrj/sgml-policy-draft/">draft</a> a year ago
in an effort to develop an LSB-compliant implementation.  The document is far
away from being finished, though.</p>

<p><strong>New Boot-Floppies for Woody.</strong> David Kimdon <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0205/msg00333.html">announced</a>
that a new version 3.0.23 of boot-floppies will soon be released.  He says
that some ports will probably use this version for Woody, depending on a
variety of factors.  A test set for i386 is available <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~dwhedon/dists/woody/main/disks-i386/current/">\
here</a>, together with a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~dwhedon/boot-floppies_3.0.23_i386.changes">\
changes file</a>.  Please test and report back to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> list.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Seminar Held in Korea.</strong> On last Saturday the <a
href="http://debianusers.org/">Korean Debian Users Community</a> hosted this
year's <a
href="http://debianusers.org/stories.php?story=02/05/01/9950118">first Debian
seminar</a> (English translation is <a href="mail#mail1">here</a>).  Such an event
takes place four times a year.  The seminar preparation team announced that this
seminar aims at file system management and backup of file systems for
experienced system administrators.  This encouraged people to use Debian
GNU/Linux as a file system server.  Many people discussed file systems, backup
methods, Debian related issues and enjoyed the seminar meeting.</p>
