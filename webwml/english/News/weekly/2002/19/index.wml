# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's nineteenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.</p>

<p><strong>Hardware Detection Libraries.</strong> People keep thinking that
Debian does not come with any sort of hardware detection.  This is wrong, as
Petter Reinholdtsen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02132.html">demonstrated</a>,
when he wondered why Debian has so many hardware detection packages.  <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02415.html">Jeff
Licquia</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg00024.html">Noël Köthe</a>
replied and explained the virtue and history of each.</p>

<p><strong>Open Standards: Principles and Practice.</strong> One of the
problems Bruce Perens is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02451.html">facing</a> when
he is representing SPI and Debian in various standards organisations is that
every one of them has a different definition of an Open Standard.  Almost all
standards organizations allow the incorporation of software patents,
discriminatory licensing, or other features that seriously damage the
"open-ness" of the standard.  Thus, Bruce is <a
href="http://perens.com/OpenStandards/">presenting</a> to you the first draft
of <a href="http://perens.com/OpenStandards/Definition.html">Open Standards:
Principles and Practice</a> with a link for the disucssion list.</p>

<p><strong>New European Debian Machine.</strong> Wichert Akkerman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00019.html">\
announced</a> a new machine to host certain parts of Debian in Europe.  As
pandora has been suffering from a lack of diskspace and intermittent
networking problems for a while now, it will be replaced by satie, which is a
VA2240 donated by <a href="http://www.valinux.com/">VA Linux Systems</a> and
hosted by the <a href="http://www.snt.utwente.nl/">Student Net Twente</a> of
the <a href="http://www.utwente.nl/">University of Twente</a>.  Pandora has
hosted <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">QA</a>, <a
href="http://nm.debian.org/">NM</a>, <a
href="http://non-US.debian.org/">non-US</a> and <a
href="http://security.debian.org/">security.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian Developers' Reference Structure.</strong> Adam di Carlo
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00086.html">announced</a>
his first draft of a thorough re-organization of the <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/developers-reference/">New Debian Developers'
Reference</a> which is available <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~aph/developers-reference/developers-reference.html/index.en.html#contents">here</a>.
His intent of the re-organization is to collect the duties, resources, packaging
hints, and other things to do beyond packaging in their own chapters.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Preinstalled on HP Blade Server.</strong> This will be of
interest mostly for those of you who use Debian in a professional environment.
Hewlett-Packard announced that their <a
href="http://www.software.hp.com/blade-servers/">HP Blade Server bh7800</a>
are delivered with Debian GNU/Linux (2.2r3) <a
href="http://www.software.hp.com/blade-servers/debian_img.htm">preinstalled</a>.
The HP Blade Server bh7800 contains multiple server blades. Each server blade
is a single-board computer, running a separate operating system.</p>

<p><strong>Subproject Howto.</strong> Ben Armstrong <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00069.html">started</a>
writing a <a href="http://people.debian.org/~synrg/subproject-howto.html/">\
subproject-howto</a> in debiandoc sgml.  Based on the experiences starting and
sustaining a development subproject within Debian, Ben Armstrong explains how
to start a subproject within Debian, and why they are important to the
vitality and quality of Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Debiandoc-SGML Version 2.</strong> Osamu Aoki 
(&#38738;&#26408;&#20462;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0205/msg00040.html">started</a> to
discuss improvements for the next generation document generation.  Since Woody
is practically frozen and debiandoc-sgml is in a very complete shape for the
release, it seems to be time to collect a list of requested improvements.  He
already supplied an initial list of items he would like to have changed.</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following packages were
added to the Debian archive recently or contain important updates.</p>

<p><strong>Seen something interesting?</strong> Please drop us a note whenever you
see something noteworthy that you think is appropriate for inclusion in DWN.  We
don't see everything, unfortunately, and this month will be a busy one for us.
Of course, we are also thankful for completely written items from volunteer
writers.  We're looking forward to receiving your mail at <a
href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">dwn@debian.org</a>.</p>
