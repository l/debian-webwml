# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 31st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  This was a quiet week as well, except for security updates.
However, we don't want you to get bored.  Check out this <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/cgi-bin/license-quiz.cgi">Free Software licensing
quiz</a>.  The Linux users group of Davis collected articles about Free
Software and compiled a <a href="http://www.lugod.org/microsoft/">list of
reasons</a> to avoid certain non-free systems.</p>

<p><strong>New Python Version?</strong> Torsten Landschoff <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00347.html">wondered</a>
when Python 2.2 will become the default version for Debian, since the new
upstream source of python-gnome for Gnome 2 requires Python 2.2 for building.
Chris Lawrence <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00356.html">explained</a>
that there was a consensus apparently, that Debian would move to Python 2.3 as
the next default Python version, skipping 2.2 entirely.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasing db1 from GNU libc.</strong> Ben Collins <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00538.html">announced</a>
that db1 has been gone from glibc proper since after glibc 2.1.3.  The only
reason it was kept around was for backward compatibility.  According to Ben,
it's now time to dump this old version early in the sarge release cycle so we
have time work out the details.  The announcement contains an FAQ, explaining
that db2/3/4 all provide compatibility layers.  Adrian Bunk later <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00611.html">requested</a> a
dummy package to support a smooth upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Library Name Conflict.</strong> Simon Law <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00572.html">discovered</a>
a doubly used library name <code>libdnet</code>.  Supported in Debian for
quite a while is the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/libs/libdnet">DECnet
library</a>.  The new <a href="http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/">library</a>
with the same name provides a portable interface to several low-level
networking routines.  Apparently, one of these libraries needs to be renamed,
however, the DECnet library has a historical background and the new library is
already in use in the OpenBSD ports collection.</p>

<p><strong>Large File Support.</strong> Oliver Elphick <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00597.html">asked</a>
whether it is safe to turn on large file support (LFS) for PostgreSQL binary
packages.  Miquel van Smoorenburg <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00618.html">explained</a>
that adding large file support (i.e. supporting files that are larger than
2&nbsp;GB) will not break with older kernels, but it will only work with 2.4
kernels.</p>

<p><strong>Mozilla 1.1beta?</strong> It was asked whether Debian will support
packages for Mozilla 1.1beta which was recently released upstream.  Erich
Schubert <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00640.html">\
pointed out</a> there are <code>mozilla-snapshot</code> packages for that very
purpose.  He also noted that Mozilla 1.1beta will break at least Galeon,
Skipstone and Nautilus.  Even when Mozilla 1.1 final is released, these
packages need to be upgraded in sync.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading to Gtk 2?</strong> Oohara Yuuma 
(&#22823;&#21407;&#38596;&#39340;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00671.html">wondered</a>
how the transition plan to Gtk 2.0 spells.  Erich Schubert <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00674.html">explained</a>
that Gtk 1 and Gtk 2 are not interface compatible, so simply recompiling all
affected packages is likely to be an insufficient solution.  Hence, we will
have to wait for upstream to port their packages to Gtk 2.  The transition is
partially discussed <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0207/msg00033.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> The security team has prepared fixes for
a couple of security related bugs in the stable distribution.  If your
machines running Debian are connected to the Internet you should update these
packages if you haven't done so already.  It would probably be a good idea to
subscribe to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
debian-security-announce</a> list and add the security line for apt as pointed
out on the <a href="$(HOME)/security/">security page</a>.  Updating
regularly won't make your system secure but would fix some known problems at
least.  The following packages were updated since the last issue of DWN.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-145">tinyproxy</a> --
    Doubly freed memory.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-146">dietlibc</a> --
    Integer overflows.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-147">mailman</a> --
    Cross-site scripting.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-148">hylafax</a> --
    Buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-149">GNU Libc</a> --
    Integer overflows.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-150">Interchange</a> --
    Illegal file exposition.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-151">xinetd</a> --
    Pipe exposure denial of service.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-152">l2tpd</a> --
    Missing random seed.
