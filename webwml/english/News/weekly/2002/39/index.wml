# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 39th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  This week we are pleased to include two items by both Matt Black
and Richard Wale.  Now that the Free Standards Group has released
specification of Linux Standard Base 1.2 (LSB), it is seeking <a
href="http://www.freestandards.org/linuxfuture/">items</a> missing from it,
which probably also affects Debian.</p>

<p><strong>OpenSSL with CPU Optimisation.</strong> Christoph Martin <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00061.html">announced</a>
that he has uploaded new packages for the OpenSSL library.  The new version exploits
the ability of the shared library loader to include special directories
depending on the CPU architecture.  Optimisation is currently available
for i486, i586, i686, sparc-v8, sparc-v9, alpha-ev4 and alpha-ev5.  For details see the file
<code>README.optimizations</code> in <code>/usr/share/doc/openssl/</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Problematic BitKeeper License.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00002.html">\
pointed out</a> that some of us may be exposed to tort claims from BitMover,
Inc., the company that produces BitKeeper, the software that is the primary
source management tool for the Linux kernel.  Your license to use BitKeeper
free of charge is revoked if you or your employer develop, produce, sell, or
resell a source management tool.  Debian distributes
<code>rcs</code>, <code>cvs</code>, <code>subversion</code> and
<code>arch</code> at least and this seems to be a <a
href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/1500.html">\
different case</a>.  Ben Collins however, who works on both the Linux kernel and
the subversion project, got his license to use BitKeeper free of charge <a
href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/1725.html">\
revoked</a>.  Ulrich Drepper experienced similar <a
href="http://www.uwsg.indiana.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/0210.0/1737.html">\
problems</a>.  This has also been brought up on <a
href="http://yro.slashdot.org/yro/02/10/06/0518220.shtml">Slashdot</a> and
discussed on <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00245.html">\
debian-devel</a>.</p>

<p><strong>LWN subscription for the Debian Project?</strong> A while ago <a
href="http://lwn.net/">Linux Weekly News</a> (LWN) experienced financial
trouble and identified it by <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/10688/">\
starting</a> a subscription service that has to be paid for.  Branden Robinson
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0210/msg00015.html">asked</a>
LWN whether they would be interested in donating an LWN subscription to the
Debian Project, since Debian generates a fair share of news for LWN to
cover.  Henrique de Moraes Holschuh however, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0210/msg00016.html">asked</a> to
acquire such a license, instead, to support LWN.</p>

<p><strong>KDE 3 heats up.</strong> This week the KDE Project released <a
href="http://www.kde.org/announcements/announce-3.1beta2.html">KDE 3.1
beta2</a>.  The goal of the release is to provide new features as well as to
solve several known problems.  Packages for woody are <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~schoepf/kde3/woody">available</a>
for Debian users who don't want to wait for official Debian packages.  David
Pastern gave <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0210/msg00073.html">advice</a> on
installing KDE3 as well.</p>

<p><strong>Cryptography in South Africa.</strong> Lukas Geyer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00003.html">brought up</a>
efforts by the South African government to regulate the distribution of
"cryptography products".  The <a href="http://co.za/ect/a25-02.pdf">law</a>
will require providers of "cryptography products" to register their details
with, and pay a fee to, the government.  This will at least cause a problem
with Debian mirrors in South Africa.</p>

<p><strong>XFree86 4.2.1 in unstable.</strong> After a lot of testing and
preparation, <a href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/">Branden</a> and his
colleagues from the X Strike Force (XSF) have finally unleashed XFree86 4.2.1
to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00001.html">\
incoming</a> directory.  Many thanks to Branden and the XSF for all their hard work
in making this a reality.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME 2 Transition.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0210/msg00071.html">announced</a>
to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome/2002/">\
debian-gtk-gnome</a> list that he had started to maintain a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/gnome2.html">web page</a> about using
GNOME 2 for woody, sarge and sid during the transition progresses.
This page lists the available scenarios and known issues.</p>

<p><strong>Incompatible new Bogofilter Package.</strong> Clint Adams sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg02148.html">warning</a> to
users of bogofilter.  The package uses a new database format and doesn't
convert files automatically.  His mail contains upgrade instructions for
users who would like to keep their spam databases with the new version.
Alternatively, you could just wipe out the old files and start building them
again with the new version.</p>

<p><strong>Debian "removed" archive?</strong> Drew Scott Daniels tried to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg02202.html">setup</a> an
archive of removed Debian packages at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">\
SourceForge</a>.  This issue has been discussed several times, since orphaned
packages that nobody would like to maintain are likely to be silently removed.
However, Sourceforge explained that their mission is the development of Open
Source Applications and not hosting a pure content repository.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Mini-Conf at LCA2003.</strong> Jonathan Oxer sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00036.html">reminder</a>
for the <a href="http://lca.apt-cacher.org/">Debian Mini-Conference</a> which is
to be hosted at the upcoming <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/">Linux Conference
Australia</a>.  Jonathan still needs more people willing to do presentations.
He has so far already received 39 registrations for the Mini-conference.</p>

<p><strong>Perl Transition not Migrating.</strong> Some people may have
already noticed that the new Perl 5.8 does not migrate into testing.  This is
due to several packages still depending on the older version of Perl, as Joey
Hess <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00185.html">pointed
out</a>.  Funnily, the Python transition contributes to this problem since
PostgreSQL is out of date on most architectures due to a Python error.</p>

<p><strong>Debian FreeBSD Update.</strong> Nathan Hawkins sent in an updated
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0209/msg00040.html">status
report</a> for the Debian port to FreeBSD.  Basically, he has been busy working
on glibc and has been contributing patches to the package.  He also has some
of the essential BSD utilities building under glibc and will continue to work
on the rest.  Mostly this involves working on the system headers that glibc
didn't include.  Later he <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd-0210/msg00002.html">reported</a> that
glibc is working well except for DNS resolution.  Also X is building nearly
everything except the server, which helps a lot already.</p>

<p><strong>BTS supports MIME.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00005.html">\
announced</a> that a new version of the mail bot for the Debian Bug Tracking
System (BTS) has been installed.  This version adds MIME support for initial
incoming bug reports.  This means that you can now safely submit bug reports
with attachments without having to wait for the bug number to come back,
GPG-sign bug submissions and control messages, and so on.</p>

<p><strong>W3C Patent Policy.</strong> Bruce Perens <a
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1159206.shtml">reports</a> that
after a year of argument and see-sawing the Patent Board of the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C) recommends a
royalty-free patent policy.  Bruce was invited to join W3C's patent policy
board, representing <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public
Interest</a>, and was later joined in this by Eben Moglen, for the <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>, and Larry Rosen, for
the <a href="http://opensource.org/">Open Source Initiative</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project at UK Linux Expo.</strong> There will be a Debian
booth at the upcoming <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/1009-linuxexpo">UK Linux
Expo</a> in London this Wednesday and Thursday (9th and 10th of October).
Registration is required, but there are no entrance fees.  People from Debian
will sell woody CDs at the exhibition and Debian will be demonstrated running
on various architectures (maybe even including NetBSD).</p>
