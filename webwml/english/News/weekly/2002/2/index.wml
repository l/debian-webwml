# $Id$

<p>Welcome to the second issue of Debian Weekly News, the weekly newsletter
for the Debian community.</p>

# This one is from Richard Atterer <atterer@debian.org>

<p><strong>New "Debian on CD" Web Pages.</strong> A new set of <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/">web pages</a> about Debian on CD-ROMs was
added to <a href="$(HOME)/">www.debian.org</a>.  They
finally replace the old pages on <a
href="https://cdimage.debian.org/">cdimage.debian.org</a>, which were often
criticised by visitors of the website.  Apart from an extended FAQ, the new
pages offer direct download links for CD images, a list of CD vendors and
artwork to use for your home-made CD covers.  Additionally, they provide
information about <a href="http://atterer.org/jigdo/">jigdo</a> ("Jigsaw
Download"), the new distribution scheme for downloading CD images from any
normal Debian mirror.</p>

<p><strong>KDE temporarily handed over.</strong>
Last week, Ivan E. More II, our well-known and fearless KDE maintainer
orphaned most of the KDE and Qt packages he maintained.  He feels that he can
no longer afford enough time to work on these packages properly, deal with
real life and the unique stress that is caused by being a Debian
Developer.  Thanks for your good work Ivan.  Chris Cheney and Daniel Stone took
over most of his packages, so KDE and Qt are maintained again.  They are trying
to resolve current problems with libpng2/3, so please bear with them.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting on Debian Development.</strong> Adrian Bunk wrote a long
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg00199.html">mail</a> in
which he talks about several issues with Debian that have arisen as a result
of our development process.  Adrian complains about maintainers who
have become difficult
to deal with and the project's inability to force a maintainer to do
certain requested tasks because of their volunteer status, 
the sheer amount of more than <a href="http://www.debian.gr.jp/~kitame/maint.cgi">8000 binary
packages</a>, the number of more than 900 maintainers, our release process,
the development process (which is also known as "bazaar of
small cathedrals") and the number of release critical bugs.  Fabian
Fagerholm <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg00214.html">\
added</a>: "Where before we had chaos and charismatic people hacking away into
the night, we now have people striving for orderly development of mature
systems."</p>

<p><strong>Restructuring Debian Quality Assurance.</strong> The Debian QA team
(Quality Assurance) is discussing improvements and new structures for their
work.  Adrian Bunk for example <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0111/msg00244.html">talks</a> about
forming teams and tasks for QA such as fixing release critical (RC) bugs,
discovering  packages that cannot be installed, <a
href="https://release.debian.org/britney/testing_probs.html">problems with
testing</a> and determining maintainers that are missing in action (MIA).
Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0201/msg00062.html">announced</a> a
new service for people who would like to help with package maintenance by
subscribing to a packages' bug reports.  Additionally, the QA team already
prepared lists of RC bugs with priority <a href="http://base.debian.net/">\
base</a> and <a href="http://standard.debian.net/">standard</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Debian-Med Project.</strong> Andreas Tille felt he had to start
a new project in this new year.  <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg00454.html">Debian-Med</a>
is an internal project in Debian (like <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Jr.</a>) that supports
tasks of people in medical care.  Debian-Med will have two main components:
Support for general practice and laboratory research.  Andreas is looking for
other people to help him in packaging, maintaining and documenting.</p>

<p><strong>Helping With Unfixable Bugs.</strong> Colin Watson extracted a
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-0201/msg00093.html">list</a> of bug
reports that have tag 'help' set.  The maintainer obviously asked for help
fixing these bugs.  If you're looking for some good challenging bugs to
attack, these might be worthwhile targets.  Send information or patches
as appropriate.</p>

# The next one is from Yooseong Yang <yooseong@debian.org>

<p><strong>Acronyms and Technical Words cause Trouble.</strong> In translation
of documentation, Debian related IRC channels and mailing lists, many
translators, users and developers still get stuck with some acronyms, technical
words and jargon.  These terms are difficult to translate and partially
difficult to understand if one doesn't grok their meaning yet.  For example,
neither "debless" (seems to be "disable")" nor "cruft" (is meant to be
"garbage") in the powerpc part of boot-floppies documentation exists in an English
dictionary.  MIA (Missing In Action, see above), IMHO, OTOH etc. are greek to
some newbie users and developers.</p>

# The next one is from Tollef Fog Heen <tollef@add.no>

<p><strong>Debian 2.2r5.</strong> Martin 'Joey' Schulze is <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~joey/2.2r5/">preparing</a> the fifth point
release of Potato.  It includes numerous bug fixes and renders some
previously uninstallable packages installable.  Most of the bug fixes are security
related, so be sure to upgrade once the new point release hits the mirrors.
DWN will of course announce it once 2.2r5 is out.</p>
