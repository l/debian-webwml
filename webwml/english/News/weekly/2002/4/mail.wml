Subject: Mixing Debian releases the easy way

As well as the more powerful (and complicated) release pinning method
featured in a previous release of DWN, apt in woody and sid also
supports a simpler method of achieving the same thing, with the poorly
documented 'APT::Default-Release' configuration option. To do this, add
a line such as:

     APT::Default-Release "testing";

to /etc/apt/apt.conf, and add both testing and unstable lines to
/etc/apt/sources.list. Then when you upgrade, dist-upgrade or install,
apt will only consider packages from testing by default. If you then use
a command like:

     apt-get install <package>/unstable

it will install the package version found in unstable, as well as any
libraries and other dependencies from unstable that are required to
install it.

Regards,
Rob
