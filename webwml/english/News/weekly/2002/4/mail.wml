Subject: Mixing Debian releases the easy way

As well as the more powerful (and complicated) release pinning method
featured in a previous release of DWN, apt in woody and sid also
supports a simpler method of achieving the same thing, with the poorly
documented 'APT::Default-Release' configuration option. To do this, add
a line such as:

     APT::Default-Release "testing";

to /etc/apt/apt.conf, and add both testing and unstable lines to
/etc/apt/sources.list. Then when you upgrade, dist-upgrade or install,
apt will only consider packages from testing by default. If you then use
a command like:

     apt-get install &lt;package&gt;/unstable

it will install the package version found in unstable, as well as any
libraries and other dependencies from unstable that are required to
install it.

Regards,
Rob

This can be done even more comfortable by using the -t switch to
apt-get, which will even satisfy dependencies to unstable, what the
use of packagename/unstable does not do.

The correct (and frequently used by myself ;)) ) call would be:

apt-get -t unstable install &lt;package&gt;
