# $Id$

<p>Welcome to DWN, the weekly newsletter for the Debian community.  After the
last issue was released several news services, such as <a
href="http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2002/3888.html">Pro-Linux</a>, <a
href="http://www.bsdtoday.com/2002/January/News625.html">BSD Today</a>, <a
href="http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2002-01-18-018-20-NW-DB-BD">\
Linux Today</a> and <a href="http://slashdot.org/bsd/02/01/19/1915256.shtml">\
Slashdot</a> featured a story about the Debian (GNU/)NetBSD system.  Hopefully it
gets enough attention to help its development.</p>

<p><strong>New Powermac Flavour for Boot-Floppies.</strong> Colin Walters
recently completed work on a new-powermac flavour for woody boot-floppies, and
the installer needs more testing.  The old powermac flavour did not support
newer hardware, so G4 Powerbook, iBook2, and iBook Dual USB were not supported
properly by older 2.2 kernels, and a 2.4 kernel was needed.  This will be
released with 3.0.19, please give it a try and report problems to <a
href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian mini Conference.</strong> Preceeding the next <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0204-linuxconf">Linux.conf.au</a>,
which will take place in Brisbane, Australia from February 6th to 9th, will be
a <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au/debiancon.html.">Debian mini
Conference</a> organized by James Bromberger and others.  At this stage,
speakers will include Anthony Towns, Russel Coker, Bdale Garbee, Brendan
O'Dea, Jason Andrade and others.  Anyone who is in the region, is invited to come on
down and share a beer etc.</p>

<p><strong>New 2.4 Installation Flavour?</strong> Eduard Bloch <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0201/msg00437.html">discussed</a>
how the Debian boot-floppies could support a Linux kernel 2.4.x.  His proposed
solution includes a special kernel-image package for boot-floppies and a new
flavour (in addition to <code>plain</code>, <code>safe</code>,
<code>idepci</code> and <code>compact</code>).  This will add more recent
hardware to the list of supported hardware, while the other flavours will
still work.</p>

<p><strong>Sponsoring non-free Packages?</strong> Jérôme Marant <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg00951.html">proposed</a>
that we don't sponsor people who want to upload non-free packages.  His main
concern is that people who are only trying to upload non-free packages into
the Debian archive, probably don't understand the Debian philosophy and
dedication to Free Software.  However, our <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a> talks about
support for our users who develop and run non-free software on Debian.
Additionally, sponsors are free to decide who they sponsor and what they
sponsor.</p>

<p><strong>No Freeze Progress?</strong> Adrian Bunk is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg00961.html">frustrated</a>
since he had to find out that there's no progress in the freeze of woody.
Woody won't enter the next stage of the freeze until <a
href="http://base.debian.net/">base</a> and <a
href="http://standard.debian.net/">standard</a> packages are in a releasable
state.  The current situation prohibits this: the number of <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0201/msg00010.html">release
critical</a> (RC) bugs in these packages is increasing.</p>

<p>The Release Manager, Anthony Towns, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01020.html">explains</a>:
The goal that was meant to have passed was "no outstanding RC bugs in base".
However with things like outstanding glibc security bugs for about one month,
along with some other RC issues that have been around, partially even with a
patch sitting in the Bug Tracking System (BTS), he doesn't see much point
worrying about all the other things that need to be done.  Anthony adds the
following request: Fix RC bugs promptly, and other bugs as soon
as you can.</p>

<p><strong>Internationalizing APT.</strong> Michael Piefel <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01170.html">announced</a>
that he is working on an internationalized version of APT and related tools
from the same package.  Currently Brazilian Portuguese, Dutch, German,
Italian, Polish and Spanish are supported.  If you want to help, please check
out the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~piefel/apt/">status page</a>.
Michael has uploaded a <a
href="http://incoming.debian.org/apt-i18n_0.5.4-1_i386.changes">preliminary
package</a>.</p>

<p><strong>A New Release Scheme?</strong> Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://www.fs.tum.de/~bunk/Debian/freeze">proposed</a> a different
release scheme to the Release Manager, which he thinks will result in a
release by June this year.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01466.html">proposed</a> to
fix an RC bug with every post to the thread instead of eating up time and
beating ones arguments into the ground.  Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01326.html">added</a> that
the proposel doesn't solve the problems with base packages having unfixed RC
bugs.</p>

<p><strong>VAX Port of Debian?</strong> Greg Ingram has an old VAX machine
running GNU/Linux and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01512.html">would like</a>
to start porting Debian to this architecture.  The only answer to his request
for instructions came from Marcus Brinkmann, who replied with a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01524.html">detailed
list</a> that starts with "Get rid off your job, your hobbies and all your
friends".  That's from the person who once started the Hurd port, not a good
sign, but Greg has a long path to go until he eventually succeeds.</p>

<p><strong>Mixing Debian Releases the Easy Way.</strong> Robert McQueen sent
us a <a href="mail#1">note</a> about
mixing several different releases of Debian with the same configuration.
You'll still be able to use the testing distribution for updates, but you are
also able to install packages (and their dependencies) from the unstable
distribution if you like to.</p>

<p><strong>CD Image Mirrors.</strong> Josip Rodin finally posted the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0201/msg00156.html">list</a> of
currently 66 sites that mirror Debian CD images, that are recorded in the
central Debian mirror database.  These sites distribute CD images through FTP,
HTTP or <code>rsync</code>.  Several people are asking for images of 2.2r5,
which are not yet added to the <a href="$(HOME)/CD/">main
CD page</a> but should be soon.</p>

<p><strong>Mobile Debian?</strong> Josh Hansen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01626.html">wondered</a> if
there is any current plan for a mobile edition of the Debian distribution, for
use on handhelds like the iPAQ.  Shaleh <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01630.html">explained</a>
that Debian has been used as a basis for the iPaq's linux distribution.
However it is not designed for handlhelds so they changed a whole lot.  Even
use a different (but very very similar) packaging format.  Additionally, there
is the <a href="http://intimate.handhelds.org/">Intimate Project</a> which is
a fully blown debian based linux distribution for the Compaq iPAQ, and the <a
href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/">Familiar Project</a> that works on
creating the next generation of PDA OS, and that has just recently published
the <a href="http://familiar.handhelds.org/releases/v0.5.1/">release
candidate</a> for v0.5.1.</p>

<p><strong>Help with Packaging GRASS.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01702.html">question</a>
came up asking about the status of packaging GRASS.  Federico Di Gregorio
replied that he has <a href="http://people.debian.org/~fog/">preliminary
packages</a> ready which are full of packaging errors and generate a single
25MB package.  He asked for help with this effort.  So if somebody wants to
help, please contact Federico.</p>

# One item by Yooseong Yang

<p><strong>SPAM Causes Trouble on Debian Mailing Lists.</strong> The Debian
project runs a lot of mailing lists.  Many good disscussions about
installation problems, development related items, policy, documentation, and
so on, are made there.  These lists are distressed with a lot of <a
href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=spam">SPAM</a> mails (such
as <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0201/msg00430.html">this
one</a>).  While some people eventually unsubscribe from these lists, others
suggest solutions for preventing these mails from being delivered: <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0201/msg00229.html">procmail
rules</a>, <a href="http://spamassassin.taint.org/">spamassassin</a>, <a
href="http://spamfilter.nl.linux.org/">spamfilter</a> etc.  However, such
rules need to be updated regularily and filtering out particular charsets
could discourage developers in those countries from contributing to the
project. Note from our listmasters: The lists are already using spamfilter, but
it doesn't prevent all spam mails unfortunately.</p>
