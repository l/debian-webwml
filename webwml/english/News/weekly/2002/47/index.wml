# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 47th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  During the second <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00008.html">Bug
Squashing Party</a> for sarge last weekend several <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">release critical</a> bugs were
fixed. If you want to replace another piece of proprietary software in your
computer, have a look at <a href="http://www.linuxbios.org/">LinuxBIOS</a>.
Thomas Bushnell <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02665.html">pointed out</a>
that Matt Pavlovich ruled in the case of <a href="http://www.dvdcase.org/">\
Pavlovich vs. DVD-CCA</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Coordinated Translation of Debconf Templates.</strong> Michael
Bramer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00015.html">\
announced</a> that the <a href="http://ddtp.debian.org/">Debian Description
Translation Project</a> (DDTP) supports coordination and translation of
debconf templates as well.  <a
href="http://ddtp.debian.org/debconf/maintainer/new.all.txt">Here</a> is a
list of all packages for which DDTP contains translated debconf templates that
are not yet in the original package.  Another <a
href="http://ddtp.debian.org/debconf/template_unstable/base-config/">page</a>
contains links to debconf templates of a particular package for all
languages.</p>

<p><strong>Debian as a Social Group.</strong> Andreas Schuldei set the
structure of the Debian project in <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0211/msg00213.html">relation</a>
with experiences he gathered from reading books about group development.  He
emphasizes that Debian seems to have elected mostly technical people as their
leader and how work in Debian is splitted among a large number of people and
some groups for key tasks.</p>

<p><strong>New Version of the GFDL released.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> has published a new
revision of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl.html">GNU Free
Documentation License</a> (GDFL).  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00285.html">reviewed</a>
the changes and pointed out that the GDFL would not be DFSG compliant if
Invariant Sections or Cover Texts are claimed, just as before.  Walter Landry
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00287.html">added</a>
that the History, Acknowledgement and Dedication Sections or "opaque" formats
could be problematic as well.  In Walters opinion the clause that forbids
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or copying renders the
license non-free.</p>

<p><strong>Improving Access to Debian CD Images.</strong> Richard Atterer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0211/msg00083.html">wrote</a> that too
few of the mirror sites carry the Debian 3.0 CD images and that many only
offer jigdo files or images for 2.2r6.  He proposed that Debian offer rsync
(and maybe HTTP) access to the CD images again, starting with the first update
of 3.0.  Joey Hess wrote a script that produces a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0211/msg00092.html">list</a> of
mirrors and a table that displays which of them are down or broken, have jigdo
files, and current iso images.  He wondered why cdimage.debian.org has not
been redirected to one of the mirrors that already have everything.</p>

<p><strong>KDE3 and Debian.</strong> The Debian project has been waiting for
the transition to GCC 3.2 to be complete before KDE3 packages enter the
official Debian archives.  Michael Meskes <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg03061.html">wondered</a>
why this decision was made.  He also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg03089.html">considers</a>
the explanation "we have no KDE3 since we are still using GCC 2.95" bogus
since there doesn't seem to be a technical reason to bind one to another.
Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg03094.html">pointed out</a>
that all KDE library file sonames have to be changed when switching to GCC 3.2
and KDE developers wish to avoid that disruption.  Eduard Bloch found this
unconvincing and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg03153.html">believes</a>
the existing KDE3 packages could go into the sid (unstable) archive now.</p>

<p><strong>Fixing dependencies of lib*-java packages.</strong> Stephen Zander
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02898.html">advised</a>
that he will be filing bugs against Java packages that only depend on
java-common.  These lib*-java packages should depend on either java1-runtime
or java2-runtime as the case may be.  Stephen intends to file 'important'
severity bugs as these packages currently have incomplete dependency
information.</p>

<p><strong>New Unofficial APT Repository List.</strong> DebianPlanet <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=873">advises</a> that <a
href="http://www.apt-get.org/">apt-get.org</a> is up and running.  It carries
a list of unofficial APT repositories and allows users to submit new
repositories in addition to the old and unmaintained <a
href="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/apt-sources/">list</a>.  The
site indicates which repositories have been tested and proved working.  The
list currently includes sources.list lines for fetching the latest KDE
packages for sid, Joey Hess' bleeding edge packages, Glark packages and
various others.</p>

<p><strong>Changes to DebianHelp.</strong> In the first part of several
planned <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=3037">changes</a>,
DebianHelp has implemented a series of forums.  This replaces the old format
where all questions were posted to a single page.  <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">DebianHelp</a> also plans to develop and
include reviews of Debian-specific mini-HOWTOs, FAQs and little README-type
tidbits.</p>

<p><strong>Non-EU archive for Debian?</strong>  Nathanael Nerode <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00306.html">suggested</a>
that it might be useful for Debian to create and maintain a non-EU archive.
One reason for this is the European 'Database Directive' which provides legal
protection on things such as wordlists.  Brian Nelson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00308.html">wondered</a>
if this was a good idea.  He pointed out that the non-US archive contained
packages that could not be exported from the US but were legal to use
everywhere, at least for private use.  On the other hand, the contents of a non-EU archive would not be
legal to use in many parts of Europe.</p>

<p><strong>New Build System for Debian.</strong> Colin Walters didn't want to
wait for the dpkg maintainers to review the dpkg-source v2 code and decided to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02630.html">address</a>
the excessive complexity and redundancy in debian/rules.  He was strongly
influenced by Christoph Lameter's <a href="http://www.u-os.org/upm.html">\
u-os</a> package manager source format and the basic idea is to make simple
things simple, and hard things possible.  The code for the <a
href="http://cvs.verbum.org/debian/rules">new format</a> is online
already.</p>

<p><strong>PostgreSQL 7.3 for Debian.</strong> Oliver Elphick <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02803.html">announced</a>
new packages for the <a href="http://www.ca.postgresql.org/news.html">\
PostgreSQL 7.3</a> database engine that were uploaded into experemental.
Numerous changes include support for the SQL 92 Schema specification and
Enhanced dependency tracking for complex databases as well as several
performance enhancements.</p>

<p><strong>Alioth for Debian.</strong> Roland Mas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02857.html">asked</a>
developers to pick a name for a sourceforge site for Debian.  It will consist
of a slightly patched version of the 2.6 branch of the Debian
<code>sourceforge</code> package, with a few scripts to help integration with
existing infrastructure.  The final name seems to be <em>alioth</em> which is
the capital system of the Alliance of Independent Systems in the <a
href="http://www.alioth.net/">First Encounters</a> video games.</p>

<p><strong>SCSI versus IDE Drivers.</strong> Scott St. John <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0211/msg00258.html">asked</a> whether
SCSI drives are still superiour to IDE drives as fast as they are today.
Emilio Brambilla <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0211/msg00264.html">pointed out</a>
that IDE drives lack good command queuing and Donovan Baarda <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0211/msg00273.html">notes</a> that
IDE operations ate more CPU cycles than SCSI operations.  However, some new
IDE drives <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-isp-0211/msg00274.html">\
support</a> command queuing as well.</p>

<p><strong>Translating POD files.</strong> Martin Quinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-i18n-0211/msg00009.html">announced</a> a
new tool <a href="http://www.ens-lyon.fr/~mquinson/deb.html#po-pod">\
po-pod</a>, a new member of the po-for-everything (po4a) family.  The goal of
po-pod is permit translators to work only with well known po files when
translating pod documentation.  The goal of po4a is to ease translations (and
more interstingly, the maintainance of translations) by using gettext tools on
areas where they were not yet expected.</p>
