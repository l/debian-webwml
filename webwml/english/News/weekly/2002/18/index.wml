# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's eighteenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.  No week without a flamebait?  This week's one include
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01809.html">\
complaints</a> about delaying archive maintenance, but, of course, lacks
some substance.  We're happy to include items from Gustavo Noronha Silva and
Thomas Bliesener this time.</p>

<p><strong>International Free Software Forum in Porto Alegre.</strong> Ronaldo
Lages recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-portuguese-0204/msg00505.html">\
announced</a> the third <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0502-softwarelivre">\
International Free Software Forum</a>, held in Porto Alegre, Brasil. Many
international organizations will be represented and people from all around the
country and from many different countries are coming to take part in talks and
workshops.  The Debian Project will be represented by almost all brazilian
developers.  They will promote a course about Debian's installation and use,
and will also give a talk about Debian and Debian-BR.</p>

<p><strong>LILO Bootscreen for Debian.</strong> Philipp Wolfer <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.com/article.php?sid=664">wondered</a>
why all the top commercial distributions come with graphical LILO
bootscreens and Debian doesn't.  When he installed Woody a few months ago he
noticed that its LILO package supported the graphical boot menu, but didn't
offer any image for it.  Hence, Philipp created a bootscreen image with the
Debian logo, which you can download from <a
href="http://newswriter.org/download/files/debian-bootscreen-0.2.tar.bz2">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>People with ATM Knowledge Required.</strong> Russell Coker recently
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01721.html">intended</a>
to orphan the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/atm-tools">atm-tools</a> package,
since he doesn't own any real ATM hardware, so maintaining and debugging the
package is a bit difficult for him.  Even though, Marc Haber <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01961.html">stepped
forward</a>, he can't do much debugging either.  Somebody with access to ATM
hardware and certain knowledge in the details should raise their voice and
pick the package.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Developer Portal.</strong> Igor Genibel <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01853.html">announced</a> a
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~igenibel/">developer portal</a> that
summarizes all information and links, which are useful for a Debian developer.
This includes bug reports, release critical bugs, <a
href="http://lintian.debian.org/">lintian reports</a>, <a
href="http://buildd.debian.org/">buildd reports</a> and a listing of all
packages maintained by this very developer.  However, Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01911.html">pointed out</a>
that Tollef Fog Heen and Rob Bradford are working towards <a
href="http://debian.raw.no/">developer.debian.org</a>.

<p><strong>Woody Release Announcement.</strong> Joey Hess started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02136.html">discussion</a>
about writing a release announcement for Woody.  He's collecting important
bits that need to be mentioned besides the stock boring numbers like this many
new packages, this many updated packages, yada yada.  Here's a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02366.html">preliminary
version</a>.  Comments should be sent to the debian-devel list.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Security Round-up.</strong> Matt Zimmerman has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02186.html">tracking</a>
security issues that affect Debian/Woody.  He listed the security issues that
he has tracked together with their current status.  For each bug he attempted to
verify that, in addition to being fixed in unstable, the fixed version has
propagated to Woody.  He also added an important request to other package
maintainers, to indicate which version fixed the bug when closing a security
related bug report.</p>

<p><strong>OpenSSL and Software Licensed Under GPL.</strong> There has been
some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0204/msg00072.html">\
confusion</a> whether it is allowed to link software, which is released under
the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License</a> (GPL), with the OpenSSL library.  The problematic item is
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">advertising clause</a>,
which both of the OpenSSL licenses contain.  They represent a restriction to
the terms the GPL states.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in User-Agent Identifier.</strong> With the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0204/msg00103.html">\
release</a> of Mozilla 0.9.9-4 the Debian Mozilla uses a customized User-Agent
string, which indicates the distribution and Mozilla version.  This is
required by the current <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/revised-user-agent-strings.html">policy of
User-Agent strings</a>, which seems to be a result of a <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133171">bug report</a>,
which reveals that the Debian version contains many patches which make it a
derived version.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Debian DVD Images.</strong> Attila Nagy recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0204/msg00361.html">announced</a> that
he started producing daily DVD ISO (not UDF) snapshots for IA-32 <a
href="http://ftp.fsn.hu/pub/CDROM-Images/debian-unofficial/woody-dvd/jigdo/">\
Woody</a> and <a
href="http://ftp.fsn.hu/pub/CDROM-Images/debian-unofficial/sid-dvd/jigdo/">\
Sid</a> in <a href="http://www.debian.org/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> format.  It is
believed that this makes Debian the first distribution ever that offers
daily DVD snapshots.</p>

<p><strong>Woody CD Images up for Testing.</strong> Phil Hands <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0204/msg00390.html">announced</a> new
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/jigdo-area/">preliminary</a> jigdo files
for Woody CD Images.  Phil said that images for Alpha and Sparc are currently
missing or broken, but that should be fixed in time.  Please test these images
and report bugs to the debian-cd list.</p>

<p><strong>SuperH Binary Distribution Ceased.</strong> A while ago, Joey <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00000.html">noticed</a>
that not only the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh/">\
debian-superh</a> list was rather quiet, but the archive didn't contain any
binary files for this architecture.  The porters are probably trying to solve
a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0112/msg00017.html">\
problem</a> concerning too many halfway-incompatible architectures.  The
porters are <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00008.html">working</a>
towards cross compiling.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00010.html">explained</a>
later that our SuperH port has never been an installable distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Best Packaging Practices.</strong> Raphaël Hertzog started
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0204/msg00076.html">to
work</a> on a document named Best Packaging Practices by merging that project
with the updated <a
href="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Debian
Developers Reference</a>.  Adam Di Carlo will work on a
new skeleton for the document, then brainstorming for good ideas will follow
and finally contributers are required to fill the structure with life.</p>

<p><strong>The Most Suitable Distribution for Developers?</strong> There has
been an interesting <a
href="http://geekforum.kldp.org/stories.php?story=02/04/15/1366532">poll</a>
"What is the most suitable distribution for software developers?" (<a
href="mail#1">english translation</a>) in <a
href="http://geekforum.kldp.org/">Geekforum</a>, a Korean instance of
Slashdot.  More than 50&nbsp;% of the readers who voted, preferred Debian GNU/Linux
over other GNU/Linux distributions.  They explained that it is because Debian
GNU/Linux provides different version of essential development tools and the
user can easily exchange software.</p>

<p><strong>No Mayday Release.</strong> The much awaited release of Woody which
was anticipated for May 1st will be postponed.  Anthony Towns, the fearless
release manager, submitted a new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00020.html">\
status report</a>, saying that the only outstanding changes that need to be
made are the standard security fixes that need to be made throughout the
lifetime of stable anyway.  His report contains a verbose description of these
problems.  There is also a poor sense of timing on behalf of a fair number of
people, which slows down things.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for LinuxTag.</strong> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0204/msg00123.html">Michael
Bramer</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0204/msg00019.html">Joey</a>
started with <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/organisation.html">\
preparations</a> for the upcoming LinuxTag, which will take place in Germany
at the beginning of next month.  <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org">LinuxTag</a> is the largest and most important
exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers Free Software and GNU/Linux.  It is planned to hold a <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/day.html">Debian
Conference</a> during the show.  People who would like to ensure that certain
things get done, should lift their voice on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/">debian-events-eu</a>
list.</p>

<p><strong>Bootable CDs for Mipsel.</strong> A while ago Phil Hands <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00033.html">noticed</a> that
mipsel CDs are not bootable and Karsten Merker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00034.html">explained</a>
that we currently don't have a bootloader, which is compileable under Linux
and able to boot a DECstation from an ISO9660 filesystem.  However, later he
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00089.html">announced</a> 
that he had just managed to build an ISO-9660 CD, which  is bootable on a
DECstation. In the meantime there has been further work on this topic, a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0205/msg00001.html">patch</a> against
the current debian-cd package to allow the creation of bootable CDs for
Debian/mipsel has been posted to the debian-cd list.</p>

<p><strong>Bits from the DPL.</strong> Even though we blatantly missed this in
our last item, Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00016.html">\
thanked</a> everyone who participated in the election process this year, the
outgoing leader, Ben Collins, and the current secretary, Manoj Srivastava.  He
asked for full support to our release manager, Anthony Towns, as he leads us
through the final preparations for our upcoming release of Debian 3.0 (Woody).
This was the first of what he hopes will be a fairly regular series of
messages from the new Debian Project Leader.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages.</strong> It seems that no packages were orphaned
this week that still require a new maintainer.  Hence, we're currently at at
total of 82 orphaned packages.</p>

<p><strong>Seen something interesting?</strong> Please drop us a note whenever you
see an issue related to Debian, which you consider worth including in DWN.  We
don't see everything, unfortunately, and this month will be a busy one for us.
Of course, we are also thankful for fully fledged items from volunteer
writers.  We're looking forward to receiving your mail at <a
