# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's eighteenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.  It seems a week never goes by without a flamebait
post to the developers' forum.  This week's flamebaits include
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01809.html">\
complaints</a> about delayed archive maintenance, but, of course, lacks
some substance.  On a happier note, we're pleased to include items
from Gustavo Noronha Silva and Thomas Bliesener in this week's issue.</p>

<p><strong>International Free Software Forum in Porto Alegre.</strong> Ronaldo
Lages recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-portuguese-0204/msg00505.html">\
announced</a> the third <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0502-softwarelivre">\
International Free Software Forum</a>, to be held in Porto Alegre, Brazil.  Many
international organizations will be represented and people from all around the
country are coming to take part in talks and workshops.  The Debian
Project will be represented by almost all of our Brazilian
developers.  They will promote a course about Debian's installation and use,
and will also give a talk about Debian and Debian-BR.</p>

<p><strong>LILO Boot Screen for Debian.</strong> Philipp Wolfer <a
href="../../oldurl?http://www.debianplanet.com/article.php?sid=664">wondered</a>
why all the top commercial distributions come with graphical LILO
boot screens and Debian doesn't.  When he installed Woody a few months ago he
noticed that its LILO package supported the graphical boot menu, but didn't
offer any image for it.  Therefore, Philipp created a boot screen image with the
Debian logo, which you can download from <a
href="http://newswriter.org/download/files/debian-bootscreen-0.2.tar.bz2">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>People with ATM Knowledge Required.</strong> Russell Coker recently
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01721.html">announced</a>
his intention to orphan the <a href="http://packages.debian.org/atm-tools">atm-tools</a> package,
since he doesn't own any real ATM hardware, so maintaining and debugging the
package is a bit difficult for him.  Though Marc Haber <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01961.html">stepped
forward</a>, he can't do much debugging either.  A person with access to ATM
hardware and a familiarity with its implementation details is needed
to come forward and adopt the package.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Developer Portal.</strong> Igor Genibel <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01853.html">announced</a> a
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~igenibel/">developer portal</a> that
collects a large amount of information and links useful to the Debian developer.
This includes bug reports, <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-critical/">\
release critical bugs</a>, <a
href="http://lintian.debian.org/">lintian reports</a>, <a
href="http://buildd.debian.org/">buildd reports</a> and a listing of all
packages maintained by the developer in question.  However, Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg01911.html">pointed out</a>
that Tollef Fog Heen and Rob Bradford are working towards <a
href="http://debian.raw.no/">developer.debian.org</a> site to perform
much the same function.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Announcement.</strong> Joey Hess started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02136.html">discussion</a>
about the planned content of Debian's release announcement for Woody.  He's
collecting important facts that need to be mentioned besides the stock boring
numbers such as <em>this</em> many new packages, <em>that</em> many updated
packages, and so forth.  Here's a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02366.html">preliminary
version</a>.  Comments should be sent to the debian-devel list.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Security Round-up.</strong> Matt Zimmerman has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0204/msg02186.html">tracking</a>
security issues that affect Debian Woody.  He listed the security issues that
he has tracked together with their current status.  For each bug he attempted to
verify that, in addition to being fixed in unstable, the fixed version has
propagated to Woody.  He furthermore requested that package maintainers
indicate which version fixed the bug when closing a security related bug
report.  This information is very important for the security team and our
users alike.</p>

<p><strong>OpenSSL and Software Licensed Under GPL.</strong> There has been
some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0204/msg00072.html">\
confusion</a> whether it is allowed to link software that is released under
the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General
Public License</a> (GPL), with the OpenSSL library.  The problematic item is
the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">advertising clause</a>,
which both of the OpenSSL licenses contain. Their presence imposes an
additional restriction on licenses, which is forbidden by clause six of the
GNU GPL.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in User-Agent Identifier.</strong> With the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0204/msg00103.html">\
release</a> of Mozilla 0.9.9-4 the Debian Mozilla package uses a customized User-Agent
string, which indicates the distribution and Mozilla version.  This is
required by the current upstream <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/revised-user-agent-strings.html">policy on
User-Agent strings</a>, which seems to be a result of a <a
href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133171">bug report</a>,
which reveals that the Debian version contains many patches which make it a
derived version.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Debian DVD Images.</strong> Attila Nagy recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0204/msg00361.html">announced</a> that
he started producing daily DVD ISO (not UDF) snapshots for IA-32 <a
href="http://ftp.fsn.hu/pub/CDROM-Images/debian-unofficial/woody-dvd/jigdo/">\
Woody</a> and <a
href="http://ftp.fsn.hu/pub/CDROM-Images/debian-unofficial/sid-dvd/jigdo/">\
Sid</a> in <a href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> format.  To
our knowledge, this makes Debian the first distribution ever that offers
daily DVD snapshots.</p>

<p><strong>Woody CD Images up for Testing.</strong> Phil Hands <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0204/msg00390.html">announced</a> new
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/jigdo-area/">preliminary</a> jigdo files
for Woody CD Images.  Phil said that images for the Alpha and SPARC architectures are currently
broken, but that should be fixed in time for release.  Please test these images
and report bugs to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SuperH Port Development Suspended.</strong> A while ago, Joey <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00000.html">noticed</a>
not only that the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh/">\
debian-superh</a> list was rather quiet, but that the package archive didn't contain any
binary files for this architecture.  The porters are probably trying to solve
a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0112/msg00017.html">\
problem</a> concerning too many halfway-incompatible architectures.  The
porters are <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00008.html">working</a>
towards cross compiling.  Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0204/msg00010.html">explained</a>
later that our SuperH port has never been an installable distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Best Packaging Practices.</strong> Raphaël Hertzog started
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0204/msg00076.html">to
work</a> on a document called "Best Packaging Practices" by merging that project
with the updated <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/developers-reference/">Debian
Developer's Reference</a>.  Adam Di Carlo will work on a
new skeleton for the document, brainstorming for good ideas will follow,
and finally contributors are needed to fill the structure with life.</p>

<p><strong>The Most Suitable Distribution for Developers?</strong> There has
been an interesting <a
href="http://geekforum.kldp.org/stories.php?story=02/04/15/1366532">poll</a>
"What is the most suitable distribution for software developers?" (<a
href="mail#mail1">english translation</a>) in <a
href="http://geekforum.kldp.org/">Geekforum</a>, a Korean instance of
Slashdot.  More than 50&nbsp;% of the readers who voted preferred Debian GNU/Linux
over other GNU/Linux distributions.  The participants explained that this
decision is due to Debian GNU/Linux providing multiple versions of essential
development tools and enables the user to change between them, they have the
flexibility they demand in a distribution.</p>

<p><strong>No May Day Release.</strong> The much awaited release of Woody which
was anticipated for May 1st will be postponed.  Anthony Towns, the fearless
release manager, submitted a new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00020.html">\
status report</a>, stating that the only outstanding changes that need to be
made are the standard security fixes that need to be made throughout the
lifetime of stable anyway.  His report contains a verbose description of these
problems.  There is also a poor sense of timing on behalf of a fair number of
people, which slows things down.</p>

<p><strong>Preparations for LinuxTag.</strong> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0204/msg00123.html">Michael
Bramer</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0204/msg00019.html">Joey</a>
have begun <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/organisation.html">\
preparations</a> for the upcoming LinuxTag, which will take place in Germany
at the beginning of next month.  <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org">LinuxTag</a> is the largest and most important
Free Software exhibition and conference in Europe.  A <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/day.html">Debian
Conference</a> is planned during the show.  People who would like to ensure
that certain things get done, should speak up on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/">debian-events-eu</a>
list.</p>

<p><strong>Bootable CDs for Mipsel.</strong> A while ago Phil Hands <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00033.html">noticed</a> that
mipsel CDs are not bootable and Karsten Merker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00034.html">explained</a>
that we currently don't have a bootloader that can be compiled under Linux
and is also able to boot a DECstation from an ISO9660 filesystem.  However, later he
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mips-0204/msg00089.html">announced</a> 
that he had just managed to build an ISO-9660 CD that can boot a
DECstation. In the meantime there has been further work on this topic, a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0205/msg00001.html">patch</a> against
the current debian-cd package to allow the creation of bootable CDs for
Debian/mipsel has been posted to the debian-cd list.</p>

<p><strong>Bits from the DPL.</strong> Even though we unfortunately missed this in
our last issue, Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0204/msg00016.html">\
thanked</a> everyone who participated in the election process this year, the
outgoing leader, Ben Collins, and the current secretary, Manoj Srivastava.  He
asked for full support for our release manager, Anthony Towns, as he leads us
through the final preparations for our upcoming release of Debian 3.0 (Woody).
This was the first of what he hopes will be a fairly regular series of
messages from the new Debian Project Leader.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Number of Orphaned Packages Unchanged.</strong> It seems that no packages were orphaned
this week that hadn't already been adopted as DWN went to press.  Thus, we're currently at a
total of 82 orphaned packages.</p>

<p><strong>Seen something interesting?</strong> Please drop us a note whenever you
see something noteworthy that you think is appropriate for inclusion in DWN.  We
don't see everything, unfortunately, and this month will be a busy one for us.
Of course, we are also thankful for completely written items from volunteer
writers.  We're looking forward to receiving your mail at <a
href="mailto:dwn@debian.org">dwn@debian.org</a>.</p>
