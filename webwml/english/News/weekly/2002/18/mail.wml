<p><strong>What is the most suitable distribution for software developers?</strong></p>

<p>You've had difficulties in compiling software because it required
gcc-2.xx?  Because other software require kgcc and in some cases
additional binary files were required?  You have also encountered a
problem like "segmentation fault" and your program terminated right
away?  After you upgraded your compiler or changed it to the other
compiler, and you did the same to libraries, you may be able to solve
these weird problems.  Many developers, however, are quite
disappointed with gdb, glibc, gcc as well as malloc related libraries
which are fundamentally provided by some GNU/Linux distributions.  In
this situation, what do you think is the most appropriate GNU/Linux
distribution for a developers, not for server administrators?</p>

<p>More than 50% of the readers who voted, prefered Debian GNU/Linux
over other GNU/Linux distributions.  They explained that it is because
Debian GNU/Linux provides different version of gcc, glibc and gdb, and
also gives the opportunity for the user to easily switch to other
programs using the "alternative" function.  They thought, that the Bug
Tracking System is a powerful tool that makes Debian GNU/Linux more
reliable.</p>
