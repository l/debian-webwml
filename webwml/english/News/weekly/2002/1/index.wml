<p><strong>Happy New Year!</strong> Welcome to the new year 2002 and the first
issue of Debian Weekly News for this term.  We hope that you have survived all
New Years parties and are
feeling well again.  Let's start the new year with responsible development and
improvements of Free Software and Free Documentation.  As a sidenote: the DWN
team could also use one or two more people who submit entire items, so
volunteers are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Net Installation for Woody.</strong> Ian Eure developed some
special <a href="https://people.debian.org/~ieure/netinst/">CD images</a> for a
woody network installation for i386 and powerpc.  The images don't
contain full 650MB of packages (which you don't even use entirely), but
contain a basic Debian system, which is bootable.  Once the image is booted it
will guide the user through the Debian installation procedure until he has
reached the step where he has to set up APT.  From that step the installation
will continue using the network as expected.  Use these images at your own
risk.  If you send Ian a polite mail at ieure@debian.org, he will try to
help with any problems you might have.</p>

<p><strong>GRSecurity and Debian.</strong> Jonathan McDowell <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg02046.html">took over</a>
the GRSecurity kernel patch from
Russell Coker.  <a href="http://www.grsecurity.net/">GRSecurity</a> is a patch
to 2.4.x kernels for extra security.  It adds the ability to hide from many
types of port scans and filtering out certain information from network
transfers.  It limits access to data in /proc such that a regular user can
only see their own processes and can't see important network data (ifconfig
output is truncated) or dmesg output.  Also it severely limits operations in
chroot jails to prevent programs from escaping and includes a port of all the
OpenWall code.  Preliminary packages are <a
href="http://www.earth.li/~noodles/grsec/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pinning Unstable.</strong> Have you ever heard of the pinning
feature of recent versions of <code>apt-get</code>?  For all those who are
using woody (aka testing) but would like to use some packages from unstable,
this feature will help.  Take <code>evolution</code> as an example, since it
is currently only available in unstable.  Grant Bowman sent us a <a
href="mail#mail1">description</a> for this feature.</p>

<p><strong>Counting Potatos.</strong> Jesus Gonzalez-Barahona is part of a
group interested in measuring some aspects of software maintained by the
Debian project.  They have been <a
href="https://people.debian.org/~jgb/debian-counting/">counting</a> the number
of physical source lines of code (SLOC) in several Debian distributions.  A
paper covering this has been published in the Upgrade Magazine.  Here's an
interesting quote from the abstract: "It is also shown that if Debian had been
developed using traditional proprietary methods, the
<a href="http://foldoc.org/COCOMO">COCOMO
model</a> estimates
that its cost would be close to $1.9 billion USD to develop Debian 2.2."</p>

<p><strong>Adding Three More SuperH Architectures?</strong> Takeshi Yaegashi
(&#20843;&#37325;&#27179;&#21083;&#21490;)
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0112/msg00013.html">\
discussed</a> additional architectures based on variants of the SuperH
processor.  To support all of them, it may be required to provide binaries for
four SuperH architectures in unstable: sh3, sh4 and their big <a
href="http://foldoc.org/endian">endian</a>
versions.  It is questionable if the user base will be large enough to justify
three more architectures, though.  Yutaka Niibe <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-superh-0112/msg00017.html">explained</a>
in detail which differences and history these processors come with.</p>

<p><strong>Retrospect of DDTP.</strong> At the end of the last year Michael
Bramer posted a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0112/msg00011.html">\
review</a> of the Debian Description Translation Project (DDTP) which he
founded.  His report does not only contain a current status report but also
talks about his plans for the future.  Two Debian mirror servers already
support translated packages descriptions so the translation effort is already
in use by some users.</p>

<p><strong>Porting Volunteers Needed.</strong> Phil Blundell recently <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-arm-0112/msg00014.html">asked</a> for
more volunteers helping with the ARM port of Debian.  This port needs more
volunteers to examine build failures, fix and file bugs as appropriate.  Since
the release of Woody comes nearer and there are quite a few packages that
don't build properly on all architectures, help is really needed.  This is also the
main problem the M68k port suffers from.  We may lose that port one day, not
because of too few machines that don't keep up with the number of packages, but
because there are not enough people actually porting and fixing things.</p>

<p><strong>Multiple Boot Images on Woody CD.</strong> Jim Westveer <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0112/msg00117.html">announced</a> the
ability to put 5 boot images on the first woody-i386 CD/ROM.  With a
i386-woody CD#1, and a newer BIOS in your computer, the CD will boot, and
present you with a menu of what 'flavor' of kernel image you wish to boot
with.  On an older BIOS, CD#1 will simply boot the 'default' kernel.</p>

<p><strong>Bug Reporting in Non-Commercial Software.</strong> Seth LaForge <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-debbugs-0111/msg00000.html">wrote</a> an
article for Linux Weekly News (LWN) about using the Debian Bug Tracking System
(BTS) emphasizing how easy it can be used.  Looking at the current number of
reported bugs in the BTS our users and developers are using the BTS
to its full extent in order to report bugs in the software and thus helping improving
the software, both in Debian and upstream.</p>

<p><strong>Three Developers Required for a Package?</strong> Janos Lenart
prepared a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg02176.html">\
proposal</a> modifying the upload policy for new packages.  His concerns refer
to the bloat in Debian, since he believes that there are so many unneeded,
unused and unmaintained packages.  He would like to make it more complicated
for developers to upload new packages.  While he didn't make many people
happy, RaphaÃ«l Hertzog <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0112/msg02192.html">finetuned</a>
the proposal.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/Linux or Debian GNU or Debian?</strong> Jeroen Dekkers <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-hurd-0112/msg00233.html">complained</a>
about developers who write Debian GNU/Linux when they mean a Debian system
instead.  That's a common mistake that hurts the fledgling <a
href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/">Hurd port</a>.  Hurd people
are probably going to file quite a few bug reports about this.</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following new or
updated packages were updated or added to the Debian archive recently.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/apt-show-versions">apt-show-versions</a> 
    -- Lists available package versions with distribution.
    (Read <a href="mail#mail2">more</a>)
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/base/apt-file">apt-file</a> 
    -- APT package searching utility -- command-line interface.
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/interpreters/libnet-jabber-perl">libnet-jabber-perl</a> 
    -- Perl modules for accessing the Jabber protocol.
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/mail/mh-e">mh-e</a> 
    -- The GNU Emacs front end for MH and nmh mail user agents.
<li><a href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/sound/python-oss">python-oss</a>
    -- Open Sound System (OSS) interface for Python.
</ul>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill, make sure
you update your systems if you have one of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2001/dsa-095">gpm</a> --
    Local root vulnerability.
</ul>

<p><strong>Got news?</strong> Please tell us.  We are looking
forward to adding more interesting items by voluntary writers.</p>
