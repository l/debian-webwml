# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 41st issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  This week we are pleased to include items by Matt Black,
Andre Lehovich and Tollef Fog Heen.  We noticed that the NASA finished their
<a href="http://flightlinux.gsfc.nasa.gov/">FlightLinux</a> project which
uses a real-time variation of the Linux Kernel for onboard
spacecraft use.  If you are pondering what to do in winter or spring, what
about <a
href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/pipermail/debian-uk/2002-October/001285.html">\
skiing</a> with other geeks?</p>

<p><strong>Help with Internationalisation Support.</strong> Michael Bramer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00619.html">asked</a> for
help with modifying APT for better support of translated packages
descriptions.  The plan is to let <code>apt-get</code> download one or more
files containing the translation and display a translated description instead
of the English version if a translated description was found accompanyied with
a valid MD5 checksum of the English.</p>

<p><strong>How do you want to help Debian today?</strong> Josselin Mouette <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00009.html">\
started</a> a public <a href="$(HOME)/devel/todo/">todo list</a>
for Debian tasks.  This page tries to keep track of which tasks and groups in
the project need help.  It is already full of good ideas from Martin
Schulze and Raphaël Hertzog.  Many of the listed tasks require skilled people,
but some are accessible to a new developer or even an average user.</p>

<p><strong>Spanish Website Translation reaches 1000 Pages.</strong> Rubén
Porras informed us about the current <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/stats/">\
status</a> of the Spanish translation for <a href="$(HOME)/">\
www.debian.org</a>.  Last week the Spanish translation team has translated the
1000th webpage.  The only language which has more translated pages is Swedish,
which is maintained by a single person.  If you would like to help improve
the Debian website, please see the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/">website
helping</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/international/">Debian International</a>
pages.</p>

<p><strong>Solving Disputes between Developers.</strong> Ian Jackson released
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0210/msg00060.html">draft
guidelines</a> for solving disputes between developers.  This is a joint
recommendation of the technical committee, the project leader and the bug
tracking system administrators.  Ian addressed the problem, that some disputes
(in connection with the technical committee) are getting quite dysfunctional.</p>

<p><strong>First International Free Software Trophies.</strong> We were
informed about the first <a
href="http://www.tropheesdulibre.org/main.php?lang=en">Free Software
Trophies</a>.  If your are a developer, an organization, or a company and
have developed a new piece of Free Software you can take part by registering
the software in one of <a
href="http://www.tropheesdulibre.org/main.php?p=2&amp;lang=en">6 categories</a>.
Registration is open until February 15th 2003.  Two Debian developers already
registered the <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianEdu">DebianEdu</a> effort
and <a href="http://www.tuxfamily.org/">Tuxfamily</a>.</p>

<p><strong>BTS SpamProtected.</strong> Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00010.html">\
reported</a> that he enabled SpamAssassin filtering for all mail sent to the
bug tracking system (BTS).  Procmail and SpamAssassin have recently been
installed into owner@bugs mail, were he monitored their progress and hit
rate.  This should help against unattended bug closing by unsolicited
commercial email (UCE).</p>

<p><strong>UW Mail Packages with Encryption Support.</strong> Jaldhar Vyas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0210/msg00011.html">noted</a>
that the latest version of the IMAP and POP daemons from the University of
Washington IMAP package (upstream version 2002RC7) will have SSL/TLS support,
since there is <a href="$(HOME)/legal/cryptoinmain">cryptographic software</a>
in Debian's main archive.  Following the upstream practice which is based on
an IESG recommendation, plaintext logins will be disabled on non-SSL/TLS
connections.</p>

<p><strong>Statistics about Debian on the Desktop.</strong> A survey on <a
href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=results&amp;id=10292001114910">\
Desktoplinux.com</a> is currently asking "Which Linux distribution(s) do you
use (or plan to use) on your desktop computer system?"  With over 4900 votes
cast, Debian is placed fourth (at 8.9%) behind Mandrake (28.2%), Red Hat
(12.2%) and SuSE (11.9%).  This looks slightly better than in <a
href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=10292001114910">\
previous surveys</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Status of KDE3.</strong> There seems to be a lot of confusion about
Debian and KDE3 which may be a result of not having a standard and consistent
location to store the packages.  Therefore Mark Purcell <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0210/msg00242.html">proposed</a> that
the Debian KDE3 maintainers use the experimental distribution for the
coordination of Debian packages for KDE3.  Ralph Nolden from KDE, however,
would rather <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-kde-0210/msg00243.html">\
collect</a> everything about KDE and Debian on a debian.kde.org
website and host official KDE3 builds on ftp.kde.org.</p>

<p><strong>Update on the Debian Mini-Conf.</strong> It was <a
href="http://www.linux.conf.au/media/2002-10-16-rdp-announce.txt">announced</a>
this week that Sun Microsystems will sponsor one delegate from each Australian
state to attend the <a href="http://www.linux.conf.au">Linux Conference</a> in
Perth, Australia next year.  Users may be aware that a <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/lca2003/">Debian Mini-Conf</a> is being held on
two days prior to the main conference.  More than 50
participants are registered for the Mini-Conf and Debian Project Leader, Bdale
Garbee, will be amongst the speakers.</p>

<p><strong>Avoiding trojaned Debian Packages.</strong> Clemens Fruhwirth <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0210/msg00312.html">released</a>
an unofficial Debian package that implements a cron-based daily security check
by using a modified version of Anthony Towns' <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~ajt/apt-check-sigs">apt-check-sigs</a> script
to ensure the authenticity of Debian packages.  In subsequent discussion Jan
Niehusmann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0210/msg00336.html">noted</a>
that the most feasible approach to protect users against trojaned packages
would be to integrate these tools into the Debian system and change policy
to make package signatures mandatory.</p>

<p><strong>Automatically built Sarge CDs.</strong> Santiago Garcia Mantinan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0210/msg00098.html">informed</a> us
that sarge CDs will be built automatically every Friday night (GMT).  He warns
that these images are only for testing purposes and whilst they will serve to
upgrade a woody system to sarge, they may not do much else.  Images for the
i386 architecture are bootable with debian-installer for users to test.  All
other architectures require help from porters.  The images can be downloaded
from <a href="http://gluck.debian.org/debian-cd/testing/">here</a> using <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> version 0.6.8 or later.</p>

<p><strong>Two Reviews of Debian 3.0.</strong> Recently, two reviews of Debian
3.0 were released.  Debian Planet published a critical user <a
href="http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=831">review</a> that identified
many shortcomings of the installation process, along with specific suggestions
of how to improve things in future versions.  The second <a
href="http://linuxwatch.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Reviews&amp;file=index&amp;req=showcontent&amp;id=7">\
review</a> from Linuxwatch also complained about the installer.  It seems that
reviewers only install a distribution, they don't seem to use or upgrade
it.</p>

<p><strong>Award to Debian-based Distribution for Norwegian Schools.</strong>
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.no/">Skolelinux</a> is a Norwegian distribution
targetting schools in Norway that recently got a <a
href="http://www.nuug.no/prisen/">prize</a> from the Norwegian Unix User Group
and the <a href="http://www.hio.no/">College of Oslo</a>.  They awarded the
work on the user-friendly and well-translated distribution.
Skolelinux is based upon Debian 3.0 with several updated and packages and
uses an installer based on the new debian-installer framework.</p>

<p><strong>Using the GRUB Bootloader with Debian.</strong> Linux Orbit
recently published the <a
href="http://www.linuxorbit.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=539">\
GRUB in Debian HOWTO</a> explaining how GNU/Linux users on i386 machines can
switch their bootloader from LILO to GRUB.  If you plan to run GNU/Hurd,
you'll need the GRUB bootloader.  Another benefit of using GRUB is that it
doesn't have to be reinstalled into the master boot record (MBR) every time
the kernel changes.</p>

<p><strong>Cyrus IMAPd 2.1.9 for Debian stable.</strong> Henrique de Moraes
Holschuh <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0210/msg03731.html">\
reported</a> that he has backported packages for Cyrus IMAPd 2.1.9 from Debian
unstable (sid) to Debian stable (woody).  These are production-quality
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~hmh/packages/woody/">packages</a> and
Henrique also backported packages Cyrus IMAPd depends on.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at Practical Linux in Giessen/Germany.</strong> Alexander
Schmehl sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0210/msg00019.html">report</a>
about <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/1019-plgiessen">Practical Linux</a> that
took place last week in Giessen, Germany.  He staffed a Debian booth alone and
held a talk about Debian, introducing the Debian project and the advantages
of the Debian distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Virtual Package Dependencies.</strong> Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg00841.html">pointed out</a>
that a dependency to a pure virtual package (i.e. a package name that doesn't
refer to a binary package with the same name) should always be done with an
OR-relation that lists the real package first and uses the virtual package as
an alternative.  Accordingly, the <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-virtual">policy</a>
states that you should list the real package as an alternative before the
virtual one.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Installer Status.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen sent in another
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0210/msg00263.html">status
report</a> about the debian-installer.  Most importantly, Bastian Blank has
booted the installer on S/390 and begun fixing problems related to that port.
The debian-cd team has been busy with integrating debian-installer into their
build scripts, and work is progressing well.</p>

<p><strong>Building Packages with Emacs.</strong> Junichi Uekawa 
(&#19978;&#24029;&#32020;&#19968;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01000.html">hacked</a>
together an <a
href="http://www.netfort.gr.jp/~dancer/software/downloads/devscripts-el-0.0.20021016.tar.gz">\
Emacs mode</a> for running <code>debuild</code>, <code>debc</code>, and
<code>debi</code> etc.  The mode may be added to the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/dpkg-dev-el.html">\
dpkg-dev-el</a> or <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/editors/emacs-goodies-el.html">\
emacs-goodies-el</a> (or even <code>devscripts-el</code>) packages.  Roland
Mas, confused by these many possibilities, however, will toss a coin and see
which package name comes out.</p>

<p><strong>TrueType Font Quality degraded.</strong> Tom Badran <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01014.html">mentioned</a>
that the latest freetype library in unstable seems to be compiled differently
since TrueType font quality has degraded quite dramatically.  Krzysztof
Krzyzaniak <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01083.html">\
discovered</a> that this is a feature and not a bug.  Roger So
finally <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01134.html">\
explained</a> that Apple holds several patents on the hinting instructions
used in TrueType (interpreted by the bytecode interpreter), and enabling it
may require a license from Apple.</p>

<p><strong>New Bison more picky about Input.</strong> Fumitoshi Ukai 
(&#40284;&#39164;&#25991;&#25935;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01049.html">warned</a>
about the new <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/bison.html">\
bison</a> package (version &gt;= 1.50).  The new version seems to be much
pickier about its input files than former versions.  Fumitoshi listed the most
common <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01162.html">\
problems</a> and if this is an input problem, the input files should be
corrected.</p>

<p><strong>Automake 1.4 to be renamed to Automake1.4.</strong> In order to
provide a consistent naming scheme, Eric Dorland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01174.html">intends</a> to
rename the automake package to automake1.4.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01203.html">suggested</a>
that <code>autoconf</code> should become a virtual package, provided by the
various autoconf packages, even though any package that build-depends on it
needs to build-depend on a proper real package as well.</p>

<p><strong>GNU LibC 2.3 uncovered.</strong> Jeff Bailey recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0210/msg01370.html">\
uploaded</a> a new upstream version of <code>glibc</code>.  The changelog
lists many improvements in the Debian package and upstream has changed a lot as
well.  Most prominently a new threads package is included.  Several sudden
problems (like <code>dpkg</code> not running or Apache not starting anymore)
were assumed to be a glibc problem instead, so take care.</p>

<p><strong>New PHPGroupware for Woody.</strong> Luca De Vitis <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg01266.html">asked</a> for
assistance with new versions of the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/phpgroupware.html">\
phpgroupware</a> package which he has packaged for woody.  Please test these
packages and report any problems to <a href="mailto:luca@debian.org">Luca De
Vitis</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
