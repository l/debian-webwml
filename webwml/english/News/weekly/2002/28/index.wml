# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 28th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  It looks like Free Software got recognized by the European
Commission (EC), since a <a
href="http://europa.eu.int/ISPO/ida/jsps/index.jsp?documentID=550&amp;fuseAction=showDocument&amp;parent=news">\
study</a> of the EC suggests that software developed for and owned by public
administrations should be issued under a free license.  In response to an item
from last week's issue Henrik Härkönen told us that he prepared Debian <a
href="http://kortis.to/radix/t65/">swirl images</a> for the Ericsson T65
cellular phone.  Debian fans in Berlin are going to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0207/msg00018.html">throw</a>
a Debian release party next weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 released.</strong>  The unbelievable happened,
on July 19th Woody was <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020719">released</a>.  Woody
supports a total of eleven processor architectures, includes KDE and GNOME
desktop environments, features cryptographic software, is compatible
with the FHS v2.2 and supports software developed for the LSB.  Anthony Towns
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0207/msg00011.html">\
revealed</a> that the new testing distribution will be called <em>sarge</em>,
which is named after the squad leader of the plastic soldier, continuing the
tradition of using
codenames based on characters in the animated movie <a
href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0114709">Toy Story</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Status of Debian Jr.</strong> Ben Armstrong sent in a <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/News/2002/20020716">report</a> about
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a> effort.  He also
started a <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianJr">collaborate effort</a> on
documentation where users and developers can help.  Ben recently became
liaison between <a href="http://www.tux4kids.org/">Tux4Kids</a> and Debian Jr.
The <a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">TuxPaint</a> package
is the first new Tux4Kids sponsored package that was added to the project
since that relationship was formalized.</p>

<p><strong>DeMuDi revived.</strong> The <a href="http://www.demudi.org/">\
Debian Multimedia Distribution</a> (DeMuDi) seemed rather dormant until
recently, but was revived apparently.  Marco Trevisani <a
href="http://iuamtg.upf.es/pipermail/demudi-user/2002-July/000255.html">\
wrote</a> that DeMuDi became part of a project funded by the European
Community, called <a href="http://www.agnula.org/project">A GNU/Linux Audio
distribution</a> (AGNULA).  Let's hope the this project doesn't continue it's
lonesome path but joins forces with the Debian project so programs doesn't
need to be packaged twice.</p>

<p><strong>Writing proper Changelog Entries.</strong> Every Debian package
contains a changelog file that contains a list of changes for every revision
of that package.  There is no <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/developers-reference/ch-pkgs#s-changelog-entries">\
policy</a> for writing proper changelog entries, but is common practice
that each changelog line refers to the nature of the bug report, if it also
leads to closing that bug report.  There was a small <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/147828">dispute</a> about what changelog lines
should look like.</p>

<p><strong>Distributing binary-only CD Images.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00192.html">request</a> for
clarification was sent to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">debian-legal</a> list asking for
advice for <a href="$(HOME)/CD/vendors/">distributors</a> of
binary-only CDs or images that contain software licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>.
Basically, whenever one distributes a binary, the receiver has to be able to
obtain the source code as well, at least through mail order on a physical
medium.</p>

<p><strong>Comments and Concerns from the LPPL discussion.</strong> Frank
Mittelbach of <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX project</a>
courtesy <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0207/msg00250.html">\
summarized</a> concerns and comments he gathered from various mails that
people put up as a problem with the <a
href="http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt">LaTeX Project Public License</a>
(LPPL) or rather as a problem behind the ideas behind LPPL.  He's not going to
comment on them yet, but instead hopes for further reactions by others as
well.</p>

<p><strong>Patent on JPEG enforces non-free?</strong> A Texican company
recently purchased another company including a <a
href="http://swpat.ffii.org/patente/wirkungen/jpeg/">patent</a>
that is used in generation of compressed JPEG files.  License fees are
currently <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/07/18/157217.shtml">\
extracted</a> from various hardware and software companies.  The JPEG group <a
href="http://www.jpeg.org/newsrel1.htm">believes</a> that they have prior art,
and they're asking for more examples of prior art.  It is not yet clear
whether the library <code>libjpeg62</code> and all software which depends on
it has to be moved into non-free.  There's a heated <a
href="http://www.fitug.de/debate/0207/msg00277.html">discussion</a> on this
topic in Germany as well.</p>

<p><strong>Future of the Debian Installer.</strong> Now that Woody is finally
released, development on the <code>debian-installer</code> has to be improved.
The goal is to stop the current installation system
(<code>boot-floppies</code>) and finish development of the new debian
installer, which has a cleaner and more flexible <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/ui.txt">design</a>.  Work and
design needs to be done for a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0207/msg00227.html">partitioning
widget</a>.  Here is the current <a
href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/TODO">todo list</a> for the
new installer suite.</p>

<p><strong>The Meaning of force-reload.</strong> Tobias Burnus <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00671.html">wondered</a>
what actions the <code>force-reload</code> argument of an <code>init.d</code>
script is supposed to imply.  The <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html#s-sysvinit">Debian policy</a>
does not explicitly state what actions should happen if the daemon is not yet
running and the replies also showed different expectations.  In the end an <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/152955">addition</a> to the policy has been
proposed.</p>

<p><strong>Changing the default PATH.</strong> Santiago Vila <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00714.html">reports</a>
that he was asked to define the <code>PATH</code> variable in
<code>/etc/profile</code> only if it is not already defined. However, since
<code>/bin/login</code> already sets a default <code>PATH</code>, this change
was rejected.  Santiago was also asked not to export the <code>PS1</code>
variable at all so that non-bash shells won't get confused anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Mounting devices several times.</strong> Michael Meskes <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00781.html">experienced</a>
a problem with double-mounting devices, which does <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00769.html">work</a> for
NFS mounts.  Miquel van Smoorenburg <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00806.html">explained</a>
that with earlier 2.4 kernels you could also mount the same device on the same
mountpoint multiple times, but it confused the users and was changed in a
later version to specifically prevent this case.</p> 

<p><strong>Rewriting the Menu System.</strong> Chris Lawrence <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00815.html">proposed</a> a
rewrite of the menu system after he experienced serious problems with the
current implementation.  Several people improved the list of goals.  Sebastian
Rittau pointed out, that GNOME and KDE use the same desktop file <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/desktop-entry-spec.html">format</a>,
which seems to fit our <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00940.html">goals</a> as
well.  It was also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00838.html">mentioned</a>
with an <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00944.html">\
example</a> that implementing an entirely new programming language instead of
using an existing one embedded may not be the best solution.</p>

<p><strong>Mass filing of Bug Reports.</strong> Gergely Nagy <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00910.html">warned</a>
about a possible mass filing of bug reports due to policy violations he
stumbled upon.  This includes packages that do not include a verbatim copy
of their copyright and distribution license, packages that build their
architecture independent binary packages in the wrong target, packages that
contain copyright information in the wrong file as well as packages that
contain spurious files. Here's an updated <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01027.html">list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Internationalising Debconf.</strong> Tomohiro Kubota 
(&#20037;&#20445;&#30000;&#26234;&#24195;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00985.html">announced</a>
his plan to work on internationalisation of <code>debconf</code>.  This
includes a technique to find out the encoding type of messages and templates,
proper conversion, a new line-wrapping mechanism and output routines for all
supported user interfaces.</p>

<p><strong>New BTS Tags.</strong> Adam Heath, who maintains the Debian's Bug
Tracking System (BTS) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01084.html">announced</a>
two new <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/server-control">tags</a>.  The first new tag
<em>sarge</em> denotes that the bug particularly applies to the new testing
distribution, which is called sarge.  The second new tag <em>experimental</em>
applies to bugs which are present particularly in the experimental
distribution and hence should not be counted as release critical at all.</p>

<p><strong>New Source Packages.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg01146.html">started</a> a
discussion to change in the way Debian currently handles source packages.  The
current system has some flaws, one cannot simply add binary files for example,
and some packages implement a more sophisticated but badly documented system
to cope with some of them.  Colin has set up source code and examples so
interested parties can already play with it.</p>
