# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 30th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The former Debian developer zhaoway wrote a <a
href="http://www-900.ibm.com/developerWorks/cn/linux/platform/debian/jigdo/index.shtml">\
Chinese article</a> about Jigdo for IBM developerWorks/China.  Nice to see the
word spread.  This seemed to be an easy week, many developer were probably
enjoying their holidays, but the security team became hyperactive.  That also
applies to Branden Robinson, apparently, since he <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0208/msg00041.html">announced</a>
Debian packages for XFree86 4.2.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasing Security with the DMCA?</strong> CNET News.com <a
href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947325.html">reports</a> about an incident
invoking the controversial <a
href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c105:H.R.2281.ENR:">Digital
Millennium Copyright Act</a> (DMCA).  Hewlett Packard has threatened to sue a
team of researchers who published a vulnerability in Tru64 Unix.  Since HP
distributes Debian and two members of the Debian Security Team are
U.S. citizens, are they in danger of a similar threat?  One week later, HP
released a <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-947740.html">press
release</a> saying that they will not use the DMCA to stifle research or
impede the flow of information that would benefit their customers and improve
their system security.</p>

<p><strong>Backing up a Debian System.</strong> Drew Daniels wrote a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg02232.html">report</a> that
describes methods of backing up a Debian system.  This includes uses of the
program <code>cruft</code> to find files that are not covered by properly
installed packages.  The sysadmin guide also includes a chapter about making
<a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/system-administrator/ch-sysadmin-backup.html">\
backups</a>.</p>

<p><strong>There aint no such Thing as a Free Font?</strong> Ben Armstrong did
some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00080.html">\
research</a> on truetype fonts included in the Debian distribution.  Alarmed
by a non-free font in a package he maintains, Ben started looking for a
suitable replacement font under a DFSG-free license.  However, he was
disappointed to find that virtually every so-called 'free' font he found
failed the DFSG.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Release Party in Germany.</strong> It's been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00200.html">announced</a>
recently that some German developers planned a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0810-party">Debian Release Party</a> next weekend.
The party is meant to be fun after all and only a barbecue and breakfast are
planned, despite interesting discussions and probably hacking.  The <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/party/">party</a> takes place in Minden,
Germany and people should <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/party/signon.php3">sign up</a> in
time.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging Dock Apps.</strong> Josselin Mouette started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00149.html">discussion</a>
about packaging WindowMaker dock apps.  There are currently 28 such dock apps
packaged for Debian and <a href="http://dockapps.org/">dockapps.org</a> lists
even 90 of them.  All of these dockapps are likely to be packaged one day or
another by DD's using them.  Packaging each dock app as single package and
packaging all dock apps as one large package seem to be suboptimal, though.</p>

<p><strong>New ping and inetd Packages.</strong> Marco d'Itri <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg00170.html">announced</a>
that he plans to replace the version of <code>ping</code> and
<code>inetd</code> with programs from OpenBSD.  The new <code>inetd</code> is
already up for public <a href="http://www.bofh.it/~md/ipv6/">review</a>.  It
supports IPv6, built-in libwrap support, binding to specific addresses and
socket buffers tuning.</p>

<p><strong>Installing Debian on IBM RS/6000 Workstation.</strong> Rolf
Brudeseth released a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0208/msg00008.html">howto
document</a> describing how to install Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 on an IBM RS/6000
44P-170 workstation.  It should also work for other low-end systems such as
the 260, 270 and B80, even though this wasn't exactly tested.  Rolf also
expects the installation to work similar on the mid- and high-end POWER3
systems.</p>

<p><strong>Sarge CD Images?</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0208/msg00006.html">requested</a> that
CD images for sarge should be automatically generated every week.  He
explained that don't need to be bootable yet, but should be available as jigdo
images.  Getting CD images out as soon as possible is important if we're going
to get off on the right foot for releasing sarge any time soon.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Woody CD Covers.</strong> Robert Dodd <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0207/msg00372.html">announced</a>
that he created covers for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (codename "Woody").  The
images are freely available from <a
href="http://www.dodddigitaldesign.com/debian_cd_covers.htm">here</a>. If
anyone wants to use it but needs more information on the cover or a
different format, <a href="mailto:rdodd@airmail.net">Robert Dodd</a> would
be happy to fix that.</p>
