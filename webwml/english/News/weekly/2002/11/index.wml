# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's eleventh issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  It looks like this was a quiet week.  However, it was a great
week, since the Woody release process continues well and a Debian Developer
apparently won two Gold medals.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Status.</strong> Anthony Towns sent in another <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00009.html">report</a>
covering the Woody release.  The <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs">bug count</a> is still going
down, but more slowly than we might like.  Please keep looking through
packages you maintain or use to make sure they are releasable.  Again, he
removed a bunch of packages from Woody that seemed to be unreleasable.</p>

<p><strong>Project Leader Elections Debate.</strong> Randolph Chung sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00008.html">Call
for Questions</a> for the upcoming Debian Project Leader (DPL) Election
debate, as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00004.html">\
announced</a> by the project secretary last week.  As currently envisioned,
the debate will be moderated by the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00005.html">\
panelists</a>, and will be broken down into four parts: General questions,
questions directed to the candidates, questions that arise during the above
two parts and, finally, closing remarks and rebuttal.</p>

<p><strong>XFS based Boot Floppies.</strong> Two people are working towards
integration of XFS into Debian's boot-floppies.  Eduard Bloch created the
first installations CD image for Woody and XFS which can be downloaded from <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/">here</a>.  Angelo Ovidi
started a new project on SourceForge called <a
href="http://xfdeb.sourceforge.net/">XFDeb</a>. He already created a rescue
disk based on kernel 2.4.14 and XFS 1.0.2 and is going to create the root and
drivers floppies, too.  His aim is to unify his work with Ionut Georgescu's <a
href="http://www.physik.tu-cottbus.de/~george/woody_xfs/">Debian
installer with SGI XFS support</a> to offer the XFS journaling file system as
an option at installation time.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Developer wins Paralympic Gold twice.</strong> It seems that
one of our developers, <a
href="http://www.paralympics2002.com/athletes/biographies/41002.html">Bart
Bunting</a>, is attending the Paralympics currently being held in Salt Lake
City.  He <a
href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/sport/othersport/2002/03/item20020311102704_1.htm">\
won</a> the gold medal in the visually impaired mens Super-G and Downhill.
Bart, a two-time world champion at the titles in Switzerland two years ago, is
competing at his first Paralympics.  Congratulations Bart!</p>

<p><strong>teTeX Documentation Licenses.</strong> C.M. Connelly is in the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0203/msg00054.html">process</a> of
vetting the documentation files that are distributed with the tetex packages.
Most of them are compliant with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG), partially using the <a
href="http://www.latex-project.org/lppl.txt">LaTeX Project Public License</a>
(LPPL), <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a> (GPL), their own DFSG-compliant license, or in the public
domain. There are about 30 documents whose licensing status is less clear, and
those are the ones that are the subject of investigation.</p>

<p><strong>DebianHelp Needs A New Home.</strong> The web site <a
href="http://www.debianhelp.org/">DebianHelp</a> was created in 2000 and
aims to help out beginners to Debian GNU/Linux.  Presently, the maintainer
of DebianHelp himself, Randy Edwards, is asking for help, because the
site will lose its internet connection in a couple of months.  People who want
to offer him hosting for the web site or the server should drop <a
href="mailto:redwards@golgotha.net">Randy</a> a line.</p>
