# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's nineth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter to the
Debian community.  Our collegues from Linux Weekly News had a nice <a
href="http://lwn.net/2002/0221/">coverage</a> of the unstable Debian
distribution.  Additionally, the European Commission wants to know more about
Free Software developers, you may want to help with  their <a
href="http://floss1.infonomics.nl/">survey</a>.  This weeks compulsory
discussion on the release process of Debian is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01653.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Packages Removed From Woody.</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00014.html">\
informed</a> us about the first set of packages that were removed from Woody.
However, this isn't the last word on the matter in a number of ways: there are
certainly going to be more removals, but there's also still some chance for
some of these packages to get back into Woody if the appropriate bugs are
fixed and the package is given enough time to be tested.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto Software in Debian.</strong> You may have heard about this
subject before, the Debian project plans to include crypto software in their
main archive.  James Troup and Sam Hartman recently sent a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mirrors-0202/msg00001.html">note</a> to
all mirror maintainers, to inform them about the current situation and future
plans.  At some time after March 8th, crypto software such as OpenSSH, SSL
support, and many other enhancements will be integrated into the main archive.
This is in accordance to <a href="http://www.debian.org/legal/cryptoinmain">\
legal advice</a> the Debian project received.</p>

<p><strong>OpenOffice Progress.</strong> Some people may have missed it
already, but Jan-Hendrik Palic is still working on getting OpenOffice compiled
and packaged.  He recently announced a <a
href="http://www.linux-debian.de/openoffice/">web page</a> unveiling the
current status of his effort.  Several problems were already addressed but
there's still a lot of work to do until it can be packaged.  People who are
interested in this matter should subscribe to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-openoffice/">debian-openoffice</a>
mailing list.</p>

<p><strong>Investigating the Menu System of Debian.</strong> Bill Allombert
tested support for the Debian menu system in all window managers and menu
managers in Debian/testing.  The <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01460.html">results</a> of
this <a href="http://people.debian.org/~ballombe/wmbugs/">survey</a> are
sobering.  Too many menu managers do not support user defined menus entries
out of the box and some window managers even preprocess their config files
with <code>m4</code> which may cause problems.</p>

<p><strong>Debian as Aid Server.</strong> Matthew Grant from an <a
href="http://www.anathoth.gen.nz/">organisation</a> that hosts GNU/Linux Projects
for Developing Countries <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01786.html">reported</a>
that they chose Debian to build an <a
href="http://linux-aid.anathoth.gen.nz/">\
Aid Server</a> whose purpose is to enhance communications for aid
organisations and NGOs (Non-governmental organizations), specially suited for
conditions found in many 3rd world countries.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrading from Potato to Woody.</strong> Dale Scheetz <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01868.html">completed</a>
his second attempt at a smooth upgrade from Potato to Woody.  Things went much
better this time, but there are still some slight gotcha's that will need to
be detailed in the upgrade notes.  Before actually upgrading, one has to
install new versions of <code>apt</code>, <code>dpkg</code>,
<code>apt-utils</code>, though.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and the LSB.</strong> The Linux Standard Base <a
href="http://www.linuxbase.org/spec/refspecs/LSB_1.1.0/gLSB/book1.html">\
Specification 1.1.0</a> (LSB) was released a while back.  To make Debian LSB
complient, Chris Lawrence <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01940.html">prepared</a> an
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~lawrencc/">lsb package</a> that contains a
number of compatibility scripts and directories and provides the lsb
dependency for LSB-conformant applications.  With a few
caveats, it implements most of the LSB spec, in conjunction with Joey Hess'
new <a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/alien/">alien 8.00</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Project Leader Elections.</strong> After <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00002.html">Raphaël
Hertzog</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00010.html">Bdale Garbee</a>
the third candidate, our fearless XFree86 maintainer, Branden Robinson, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00017.html">declared</a> his
intent to run for the office of Debian Project Leader.  Campaigning begins on
February 28th (i.e. tomorrow).  After publication of their platforms, there shall
be a one week period for each candidate to create a rebuttal, and the
rebuttals shall be published on the 7th of March.</p>

<p><strong>Debian and IPv6.</strong> Not all networking packages in Debian are
ready for IPv6 connections yet.  Unfortunately many maintainers, both Debian
and upstream, often respond to patches like: "I don't have IPv6 on my system,
therefore can't validate whether or not your patch destabilizes my stable
code, so I won't accept it."  This degenerates it into another chicken and egg
situation.  A Debian repository for IPv6 enabled packages that aren't part of
Debian yet, would be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ipv6-0202/msg00044.html">\
appreciated</a>.  <a href="http://www.linux.it/~md/6to4">Setting up</a> IPv6
over an IPv4 tunnel is quite easy, says Marco d'Itri.</p>

<p><strong>MySQL Documentation is Free or Not?</strong> Recent versions of
MySQL documentation state clearly that they are not released using the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>
(GPL).  The reason is that <a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL AB</a> likes
to be the only one who may sell printed versions for MySQL.  However, they <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0202/msg00153.html">would like</a>
to release the documentation under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html">GNU Free Documentation License</a>
(FDL).  This would cause a clash, though.</p>

<p><strong>Public Relations for Debian.</strong> Karl Hegbloom <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-publicity-0201/msg00010.html">pointed
out</a> that the Debian Project lacks a good PR department that submits PR and
tech articles to news services.  News papers and services need press releases
submitted to them for reprint and redistribution.  Debian isn't included in
many of them, however, some read our press releases as well and comment on
them.  Additionally, a properly maintained press kit is missing that could be
used at exhibitions.</p>

<p><strong>New Incoming System Changes.</strong> Adam McKenna <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg02084.html">noticed</a>
that the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00006.html">new
incoming system</a> behaves different than the old one and is already
installed on both non-US and ftp-master.  Uploaded packages are immediately <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-qa-packages-0202/msg00213.html">\
"accepted"</a>, and the bugs are closed right away.  However, it still takes
up to one day until the package appears in the archive and can be installed by
our users.  This was implemented to reduce the load on the Bug Tracking System
(BTS), however a saner approach seem to be tagging these bug reports "fixed"
and close them after the package has been installed.</p>
