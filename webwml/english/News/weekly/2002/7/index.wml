# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's seventh issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter to the
Debian community.  Last week was not as eventful as previous weeks so this is
a relatively short issue.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Leader Election.</strong> Manoj Srivastava sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00003.html">notice</a> to
prospective candidates for the Debian Project Leader elections.  He intends to
collect platform statements from the candidates, and publish them on a known
location (somewhere under <a href="$(HOME)/vote/">\
www.debian.org/vote</a>) at the end of the nomination period and the beginning
of the campaign, which makes it roughly the 27th of February, 2002.  Voting
shall start on the 21st of March, 2002, and shall last for 3 weeks, ending on
the 10th of April.  The first developer to nominate himself was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00002.html">RaphaÃ«l
Hertzog</a> and the second one was <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00010.html">Bdale
Garbee</a>.</p>

<p><strong>PHP4 Orphaned.</strong> Petr Czech <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/132980">orphaned</a> PHP4 last week.  The main
reason cited was the lack of time required to maintain these packages and fix bugs
in them.  Adam Conrad offered to take over these packages and Petr will sponsor
his packages until he eventually completes the new-maintainer process.  Adam says
that he is pretty familiar with the PHP source, and writes PHP modules on his
own.  Be warned, these packages need a rebuild or apt-get will remove them in
favour of the new Apache packages.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on Zaurus PDA.</strong> Joey Hess <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0202/msg00145.html">informed</a> us that
it looks like Sharp's Zaurus PDA (the one with the neat integrated keyboard)
uses busybox dpkg and Debian packages.  There's also a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/zaurus">sourceforge project</a> which
covers open source development of tools, applications, and games for the
Zaurus PDA.</p>

<p><strong>Boot-Floppies 3.0.19.</strong> David Kimdon <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0202/msg00180.html">announced</a>
that the source of boot-floppies 3.0.19 was uploaded.  A first problem with
this upload has already been found, unfortunately -- it wasn't possible to load
any network drivers on the idepci flavour.  The problem appears to be a <a
href="https://bugs.debian.org/132561">modconf bug</a> which can be avoided by
building with the modconf in testing.  Oh dear!  Attila Nagy also <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0202/msg00393.html">reported</a> the
first severe problem.</p>

<p><strong>Commenting on Draft 1.2 of GNU FDL.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> is <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0202/msg00046.html">seeking</a>
comments on draft 1.2 of the GNU FDL.  The draft is <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.2-draft.txt">here</a> and they also
provide a <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/fdl-1.1-to-1.2-draft.diff">\
unified diff</a> against version 1.1.  The FSF is asking for feedback from the
Free Software community on this draft.  Please send comments to <a
href="mailto:fdl-comments@fsf.org">fdl-comments@fsf.org</a>.  The comment
period is open until 1 March 2002.</p>

<p><strong>New Bug-Squashing Party Next Weekend.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00007.html">\
announced</a> the seventh Bug-Squashing Party which will take place from
the 15th to 17th of February.  The effort will be concentrated upon bugs in <a
href="http://base.debian.net/">base</a> and <a
href="http://standard.debian.net/">standard</a> packages.  Frivolous NMUs
are to be avoided, but if there is a patch available and there has been no
activity for a while, an NMU might be carried out.  The party will be
coordinated through the IRC channel #debian-bugs on OpenProjects, as usual.</p>

<p><strong>Security Enhanced Debian.</strong> Russell Coker sent in a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg00803.html">report</a>
about his effort on Debian packages including SE patches from the NSA for a
system running an SE enabled kernel.  The <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/kernel-patch-2.5-lsm">\
kernel patch</a> required is already been uploaded to the Debian archive.  Russell
put new versions of core utilities <a
href="http://www.coker.com.au/selinux/">online</a> already.
He is getting very close to having a working SE system.</p>
