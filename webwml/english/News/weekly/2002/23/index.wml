# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's twentythird issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.  We're sorry that you've had to survive two weeks
without an issue of DWN, but since Joey is the only editor, who was
unavailable for a while, it had to be postponed.  Another change refers to the
release date.  From now on DWN will be released on Tuesday, so <a
href="http://lwn.net/">LWN</a> will get a chance to refer to a current version.</p>

<p><strong>New Security Build Infrastructure.</strong> Anthony Towns <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0206/msg00002.html">reported</a>
about how security updates will be handled in the future.  The security
archive will be converted to make use of katie, the general archive janitor,
and packages will be rebuild by buildd's just as if they were normal
packages.  The mail contains detailed instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Release Status Update.</strong> Anthony Towns sent an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0206/msg00003.html">update</a>
for the Woody release.  He emphasizes that we're not entirely done developing
Woody.  Anthony also encourages developers to poke around at Woody and fix the
remaining severe problems.  He asks if there are any major issues that
desperately need to be addressed before we release?</p>

<p><strong>Unofficial Woody MiniCD Images.</strong> Chris Lawrence <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0206/msg00046.html">reported</a> that
he updated the <a href="http://www.phy.olemiss.edu/debian-minicd/">\
LordSutch.com MiniCD images</a> for alpha, i386, m68k, and PowerPC to the
current state of Woody.  The main change is the upgrade of dpkg and the
addition of ipppd for the benefit of ISDN users.  The images are small enough
to burn to a 8&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;inch) CD-R/RW, and contain enough packages to
install a functional version of Debian Woody without going to the net.</p>

<p><strong>Gibraltar Firewall.</strong> Joey <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20020613">reported</a> about the <a
href="http://www.gibraltar.at/">Gibraltar project</a> that aims to produce a
Debian GNU/Linux-based router and firewall package, which will be bootable
directly from a CD-ROM.  Their lead developer, Rene Mayrhofer, is a Debian
guy, and the source code for this project is available for download.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in your Home Stereo Component?</strong> It's been <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT9481439159.html">said</a> on
linuxdevices.com that SONICblue's <a
href="http://www.sonicblue.com/audio/rio/rio_audiocenter.asp">Rio Central</a>
is derived from that of the Rio (formerly <a
href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT5630105143.html">empeg</a>) car
player, which was developed from an early version of the Debian/ARM port using
a <a href="http://www.linuxdevices.com/products/PD7399900675.html">StrongARM
SA1110</a> system-on-chip processor.  Rio Central is a high-fidelity home
stereo component that stores up to 650 CDs on its built-in hard drive.
SONICblue describes the Rio Central as being "As simple to use as a CD player,
but as smart as a PC".</p>

<p><strong>Debian at Berliner Linux Infotage?</strong> In September another
GNU/Linux show is arranged in Berlin, Germany. It is planned to have talks
about GNU/Linux in governmental agencies, in the network and at the desktop
scheduled during <a href="http://www.linuxinfotage.de/">Berliner Linux
Infotage</a>.  Interested people should check the <a
href="http://www.linuxinfotage.de/cfp.htm">Call for Papers</a> (even though
the submission period is over) and get in touch with the organisers.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at Linux.conf.au 2003?</strong> James Bromberger informed us
about <a href="http://conf.linux.org.au/">Linux.conf.au 2003</a>, which will
take place at the University of Western Australia in Perth from January 22nd
to 25th.  The <a href="http://conf.linux.org.au/cfp.html">Call for Papers</a>
is still running, so you can submit abstracts for talks covering Debian.  If
you would like to run a <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/bof.html">BoF session</a> instead,
please also get in touch with the organisers.  There is also a good chance
that there will be another Debian mini-conf run on the 20th and 21st of
January 2003.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Developer Survey.</strong> Matt McClanahan <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02998.html">asked</a> for a
minute of time from Debian package maintainers to help <a
href="http://www.dodds.net/~cardinal/survey/">collecting</a> some information.
The survey is anonymous and basically asks demographic information that will
be used in class to look for correlations.  Matt plans to publish the results
later.</p>

<p><strong>Debian project at LinuxTag 2002.</strong> The Debian project
participated in this year's <a href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0606-linuxtag">\
LinuxTag</a> show.  We were lucky to maintain a large booth and used a beamer
as eye catcher to attract visitors, which worked well.  The booth staff gave
away free <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/cd.html">Woody
CDs</a>, sold mugs and t-shirts and organized a one-day conference for Debian
people.  Jon Åslund released a <a
href="http://www.d.kth.se/~d98-jas/karlsruhe/index.php?2002-06-12">diary</a>
together with some <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2002/pictures.html">\
pictures</a>.  During the show, Joey was invited as Debian representative in
an <a href="http://www.heise.de/chat/archiv/02/06/07/">online discussion</a>
about the <a href="http://www.unitedlinux.com/">UnitedLinux</a> effort.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at Linux@work Roadshow.</strong> The Debian project has been
invited to participate at this year's <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0605-linuxatwork">Linux@work</a> shows.  The show
travels around and stops in important European cities.  This exhibition and
conference is dedicated entirely to business people who do or do not plan to
use GNU/Linux.  Some special solutions will be shown as well as general
efforts.  Andreas Schmehl wrote a report for the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0206/msg00122.html">Frankfurt
show</a>, Wouter Verhelst wrote one for the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0206/msg00128.html">Brussels
event</a> and Federico Di Gregorio sent in a report about the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu-0206/msg00150.html">Milano
show</a>.</p>

<p><strong>CPU optimized Debian builds?</strong> Every once in a while, the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02210.html">question</a>
pops up why Debian does not support pentium-optimised or athlon-optimised
binaries for that particular processor.  However, as Michael Stone <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02220.html">points out</a>
nobody did some research to <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02237.html">back up</a> the
idea of things running significantly faster.  Daniel Burrows also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0205/msg02258.html">noted</a> that
we don't provide an optimised glibc due to unforseen bugs with its optimisation.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-129">UUCP</a> --
