# $Id$

<p>Welcome to the fifths issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the Debian
community.  The past week has been an exciting one.  A lot of talk with regard
to the upcoming release of woody took place on the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> list.  This
issue contains items by Tollef Fog Heen and Yooseong Yang, which are
greatly appreciated.  The mail version of this issue uses a new style for
embedding links which was generated by a script provided by Aaron Schrab.
Please let us know if it makes DWN easier to read or not.</p>

<p><strong>New GDB Manuals free?</strong> Thomas Bushnell <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00227.html">reports</a>
that a new upstream GDB release has been made which fixes the copyright
problem on the GDB manuals.  It fixes the fact that the GDB manuals (for some
presumably accidental reason) labelled various technical sections as being
invariant.  Thomas <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00229.html">says</a> that
this makes GDB now in the same category as Emacs and GCC: not unproblematic,
but also not horrible.

<p><strong>Package Tracking System.</strong> Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0201/msg00011.html">\
announced</a> the new Package Tracking System.  It allows developers
to subscribe to all messages regarding a source package: Bug messages
and «Installed» messages (not yet implemented, though).  This service
can be used by "backup maintainers" to follow a package, or by
upstream authors who wish to follow how their package is handled
within Debian, or by people doing an NMU.  Send a message containing
the word «help» to pts@qa.debian.org for instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging an O'Reilly Book.</strong> Stefano Zacchiroli <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00250.html">wanted</a> to
package the electronic version of an O'Reilly book covering Objective Caml and
was wondering if the package could go into the main distribution.  Even though
O'Reilly <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00254.html">\
believes</a> that the license meets the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract#guidelines">DSFG</a> opinions <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00260.html">vary</a>, so
the book was about to be <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00258.html">packaged</a>
for non-free.  However, O'Reilly later <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0201/msg00268.html">modified</a>
the license, so it now meets the DFSG and can go into the main distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Outdated Netscape Packages?</strong> Although Netscape 4.79 was
released on November 16th, 2001, the Debian package is still at 4.77.
DonDiego <a href="http://www.debianplanet.org/article.php?sid=570">\
wondered</a> whether the Netscape package is orphaned or not.  Several <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/netscape">bugs</a> are outstanding for more than
60 days.  Packages for other browsers seem to be better maintained.  Netscape
has <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=01/06/06/1149203">lost the
browser battle</a>, while Mozilla (or Mozilla-based browsers respectively) and
Konqueror prevail among Open Source web browsers in the Debian distribution.</p>

<p><strong>The Emacs Operating System.</strong> Adam Major <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01877.html">wondered</a>
about a couple of strange manpages distributed with the Emacs 21 package.
Replies to his original mail uncovered <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01882.html">phases of the
moon</a>, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01888.html">\
pong</a>, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01889.html">\
tetris</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01941.html">\
display-battery</a>.  The latter is useful for all notebook users who like to
keep an eye on the battery.  The discussion ended in Adam saying: "Will this
madness never end?  I'm trying to get some work done!"</p>

<p><strong>Desktop Entry Standard or Debian Menu System?</strong>
Chris Cheney suggested to switch to the <a
href="http://www.freedesktop.org/standards/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec.html">\
Desktop Entry Standard</a> which has been adopted by recent Gnome and KDE.
Even though a distribution neutral menu system would be a good thing, Ben
Armstrong <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg02034.html">\
pointed out</a> that the Debian menu system does more than just provide a way
of specifying desktop-neutral menu entries.  It provides the mechanism for
implementing the same set of menus across
all window managers.  Joseph Carter <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg02092.html">added</a> that
the Desktop Entry Standard lacks support for requirements (such as: needs x11,
a virtual console, a terminal etc.).</p>

<p><strong>Adrian Bunk Retired.</strong> Since the woody release is making
only very little progress (if any), Adrian Bunk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg02160.html">decided</a> to
retire from the Debian project entirely and orphaning all of his packages.
The current release process has led
to very few motivation on Adrians side and he doesn't see his work honored in
Debian in form of a new stable release in the forseeable future.</p>

<p><strong>Addressing the Release.</strong> Anthony Towns posted a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0201/msg00014.html">\
roundup</a> targetting the woody release.  Basically he says that there is
currently no real progress.  There is absolutely no magic that can be done to
make a bunch of buggy useless software acceptable as a Debian release.  We
shouldn't resign, though.  Indeed, it is quite obvious what needs to be done:
<strong>we need to fix these bugs</strong>.</p>

<p>Besides, NMU (non-maintainer uploads) are ok as of now.  However, please
keep in mind that a maintainer upload is still better, passing on patches and
helping the maintainer to integrate them, is preferred as well.  There's also
a system implemented for NMUs that will delay the installation up to 10 days
(see details in Anthony's mail).  Please note that once you've made an NMU it
is your responsibility to make absolutely sure you didn't break the
package.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade Problems.</strong> The Debian distribution is known for
smooth upgrades from one stable release to the next one.  Upgrading from
potato to woody, though, does not seem to follow this path.  Several reports
demonstrate problems during the upgrade, such as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01694.html">this one</a>
from Dale or <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0112/msg02261.html">tha one</a>, to
name some examples. Ted T'so <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0201/msg01771.html">asked</a>
if Debian can only be used by experts or by regular users as well.</p>

<p><strong>Installation Problems.</strong> During an <a
href="http://www.debian.org/events/2002/0124-hct">exhibition</a> (HCT, in
Germany) several Debian people tried to install a plain Debian woody system
onto another exhibitor's machine.  This should have worked just as smooth as
expected, but didn't.  We failed with the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0201/msg00768.html">Malformed
release file</a> error and even the patch from the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0201/msg00794.html">didn't work</a>
as expected.  It only went worse, after patching the file manually, nano-tiny
received a segmentation fault.  This clearly demonstrates, that Debian needs
more testing of boot floppies and more clueful people working on this
system.</p>

<p><strong>Debian as a CORBA Component?</strong> Colin Walters was annoyed
that the web interface to <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">\
packages.debian.org</a> only displays i386 packages.  He started thinking
about how to implement a replacement realized that he access to the database
on auric.  That alone cried out for a CORBA interface.  Once there is a CORBA
interface to the archive, why not a CORBA interface to the bug tracking system
and to other services?  He already implemented a <a
href="http://cvs.verbum.org/debian/debian-corba/">working prototype</a>.</p>

<p><strong>XFree86 4.2.0 is Out!</strong> On January 18th <a
href="http://www.xfree86.org/4.2.0/">XFree86 4.2.0</a> was released.  On <a
href="http://debianplanet.org/">DebianPlanet</a> the <a
href="http://debianplanet.org/article.php?sid=578">question</a> came up
whether Debian is going to package it anytime soon.  Branden Robinson updated
the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/">X Strike Force</a> pages on
which he explains that he is currently preparing packages for 4.1.0-14.  He
has also started to work on version 4.2.0 but cannot promise when packages may
be ready.  As in the past, the first packages of the new upstream version that
will be available will be experimental pre-releases from his private <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/woody/">repository</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New or Noteworthy Packages.</strong> The following new or
updated packages were added to the Debian archive recently.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/file-roller.html">file-roller</a> 
    -- Archiver for GNOME.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/net/gg-gnome.html">gg-gnome</a> 
    -- An instant messenger compatible with Gadu Gadu.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/electronics/gputils.html">gputils</a> 
    -- GNU PIC utilities.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/postfix-dev.html">postfix-dev</a> 
    -- Postfix loadable modules development environment.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/electronics/sdcc.html">sdcc</a> 
    -- Small Device C Compiler.
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/x11/xfonts-gimpers.html">xfonts-gipmers</a> 
    -- X11 fonts created by Artwiz and TigerT.
</ul>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> Under normal circumstances we would
recommend to upgrade your packages.  However, since the most recent <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-02/msg00013.html">\
security advisory</a> breaks what it ought to fix instead, please be careful
when upgrading on a machine which acts as anonymous rsync server.  You would
fix a remote root hole, but you would also shut down the service.  It may be
advantageous to recompile the package from unstable on your potato machine
instead.</p>

<p><strong>Orphaned Packages.</strong> 18 packages were orphaned this week and
need a new maintainer.  This makes it total 113 orphaned packages.  Please see
the <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">WNPP pages</a> for the full
list.</p>
