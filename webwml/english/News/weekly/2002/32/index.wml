# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 32nd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  The FLOSS (see below) survey is finished and the results
were posted.  The most interesting bit is the number of Debian users among the
participants, however, since we pointed out that survey, we may have
contributed a little bit to the trend...</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Mr. Tux Paint</strong> In this <a
href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1549">interview</a> with Bill
Kendrick of New Breed Software, Bill explains that he decided to write <a
href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">Tux Paint</a> because a
friend of him who uses Debian Jr. with his children noticed we were lacking a
paint program for children. Before Bill wrote it, there was nothing like Tux
Paint, designed specifically for children with sounds, fun to use "magic"
tools, and a simple user interface in our distribution.  The closest thing to
it was The Gimp, and that is a program even adults have trouble using.
Debian Jr. now has not only packaged Tux Paint, but keeps tabs closely on new
releases, communicating regularly with Bill about development of new features,
and helping him to shake out the bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Where should Debian People IRC?</strong> Since about 1996, the
Debian project used IRC servers of Open Projects Network for real-time
communication.  Josip Rodin <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0208/msg00046.html">points
out</a> that the founder of this network has started soliciting donations for
the use of the network, in a highly questionable way.  <a
href="http://www.oftc.net/">OFTC</a> (Open and Free Technology Community) was
suggested as an alternative network, which is an <a
href="https://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/resolution-2002-07-02.iwj.5.html">\
affiliated project</a> of <a href="https://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the
Public Interest</a> that supports Debian already.  Rob Levin <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0208/msg00054.html">tried</a> to
explain why spamming users with requests to donate is done.</p>

<p><strong>Free/Libre and Open Source Software report.</strong> In a <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2002/9/">former issue</a> we mentioned that the
European Commission was accomplishing a survey about Free Software
developers. The recently published final report reveals much data concerning
the age, social status, motivation etc. of the corresponding developers. The
question about their favorite distribution/operating system <a
href="http://floss1.infonomics.nl/stats_13.html">answered</a> 1069 from 2228
developers (48&nbsp;%) with "Debian" followed by "Red Hat" (14&nbsp;%) and
"Mandrake" (10&nbsp;%). The complete report is available <a
href="http://www.infonomics.nl/FLOSS/report/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Problems implied by GCC 3.2.</strong> Debian will sooner or later
switch to using version 3.2 of GCC for all architectures.  However, the binary
interface for C++ programs has <a
href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.2/c++-abi.html">changed</a> again.  The main
point of the GCC 3.2 release is to have a relatively stable and common C++
binary interface for GNU/Linux and BSD usage.  Unfortunately this means that
GCC 3.2 is incompatible with GCC 3.0 and GCC 3.1 releases.  Matthew Wilcox is
working on an <a href="https://people.debian.org/~willy/c++transition.html">\
update plan</a> already and Luca Barbieri <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01072.html">released</a>
his thoughts as well.</p>

<p><strong>Free Dustismo Font.</strong> Dustin Norlander, a font designer who
contacted us before for help him with licensing a free font, <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2002/debian-devel-200208/msg00938.html">\
created</a> a first <a
href="http://www.cheapskatefonts.com/fonts/Dustismo.zip">font package</a>.
The font is in Unicode encoding but does not yet contain all special
characters for commonly used non-english languages.  However, Dustin is
seeking feedback so you may want to contact <a
href="mailto:lung82@yahoo.com">him</a> directly.</p>

<p><strong>Multilingual Security Lists?</strong> Joey <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0208/msg00191.html">\
wondered</a> if multilingual security-announce lists would help our users more
than they could damage.  His main concern is that, being a volunteer
organization, the Debian project cannot guarantee that a translated advisory
will be posted immediately after the original advisory was released.  If users
don't notice the original advisory, they may not be aware of a publicly
known vulnerability in their systems, and hence vulnerable for a longer time
than is healthy.  On the other hand, translations are available in several
languages on <a href="$(HOME)/security/">www.debian.org</a> after the advisory
has been released.  Oohara Yuuma (&#22823;&#21407;&#38596;&#39340;) <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-0208/msg00219.html">explains</a>
how security advisories are handled for Japanese users.</p>
