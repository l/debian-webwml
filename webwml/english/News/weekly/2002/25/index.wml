# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's twentyfifth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for
the Debian community.  We are happy to <a
href="http://news.com.com/2100-1001-939881.html">learn</a> that UnitedLinux
will apparently be based on the Debian distribution, since Ex-CEO of Caldera,
Ransom Love, will be <em>trying to find a way to include members such as
Debian</em>, <em>which don't have the commercial focus of the current
UnitedLinux partners</em> -- and to us this looks like the only logical
way.</p>

<p><strong>HomePNA HOWTO with Debian GNU/Linux.</strong> On <a
href="../../oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/">Debian Planet</a>, Jeremy Avnet <a
href="../../oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/article.php?sid=704">posted</a> a link to a <a
href="http://www.homepna.org/support/faqs.html#FAQ6_Q4">HOWTO</a> that
describes how to set up HomePNA with GNU/Linux.  HomePNA is a
technology that uses the unused pairs on a plain old analogue line (or in fact
a cat 5 cable), as a relatively slow networking system.</p>

<p><strong>More than 10,000 Debian Packages for Sid.</strong> Recently, the
number of Debian packages for Sid (also known as "unstable") has reached the
10k mark.  The binary-i386 distribution contains 6961 packages and binary-all
adds 3149 packages to the list.  They are built from 6345 source packages.
These numbers include non-US as well as non-free and contrib.  If you use
dselect method, the message, "Information about (the number of packages) was
updated", shows up after [U]pdate.  When you are familiar with apt,
<code>apt-cache stats</code> shows the number of package in the package
database on your system.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates for Woody.</strong> Some of you may have noticed
already that the Security Team is already supporting Woody in their <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-02/msg00045.html">\
advisories</a>.  Apparently the new <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0206/msg00002.html">\
security build structure</a> is working properly.  In order to use the updated
packages automatically, you should add
<em><code>deb http://security.debian.org/ woody/updates main contrib non-free</code></em>
to your <code>sources.list</code> if you are running Woody.</p>

<p><strong>Java Beans for Debian People.</strong> Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-java-0206/msg00040.html">announced</a>
that he finished building Debian packages of <a
href="http://www.jboss.org/">JBoss</a>.  All changes left are just minor bug
fixes.  This is an implementation of Sun's
Java2 Enterprise Edition EJB specification. It provides container based
persistence, message queues, transaction management and other services.
While JBoss itself is GPL, it requires non-free software to run.  JBoss
developers, in order to provide an easier to run download, have elected to
include these non-free programs and libraries with their source.  Because of
this, Adam has placed the files in the <code>non-free</code> directory.</p>

<p><strong>Newer Versions of Perl Modules?</strong> Ardo van Rangelrooij
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-0205/msg00010.html">wanted to
know</a> how a package maintainer is supposed to handle the case when a Perl
module requires a newer version of another module than the version included in
the <code>perl-modules</code> package.  This package contains modules from the
core Perl distribution.  The solution is to simply package the new module as
usual.  The files will be placed in a directory which is preferred over the
system provided one, so both modules can coexist.</p>

<p><strong>Pilot Sync Software Recommendation.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-pilot-0205/msg00007.html">question</a>
came up asking which software for synchronizing data on the handheld with the
main machine should be used, if one depends on data integrity.  Karl Jørgensen
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-pilot-0205/msg00013.html">\
summarized</a> his experience with <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/pilot-manager">pilot-manager</a>, <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/gnome-pilot">gnome-pilot</a> and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/jpilot">jpilot</a>.  People seem to be happy
with jpilot.  For those who don't require a graphical user interface, <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/coldsync">coldsync</a> may be worth a
try.</p>

<p><strong>Daily Debian Snapshots.</strong> Fumitoshi Ukai 
(&#40284;&#39164;&#25991;&#25935;) <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01816.html">set up</a> a
new host called <a href="http://snapshot.debian.net/">snapshot.debian.net</a>
that contains both a debian and debian-non-US mirror.  The server has a
160&nbsp;GB hard disk and provides daily snapshots of the Debian archive
dating back from 2002/06/04.  To access this repository you'll have to direct
<code>apt-get</code> to a specific date, relative dates are ok.</p>

<p><strong>Abandoning /etc/mtab?</strong> Nikita Youshchenko made an <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01831.html">attempt</a> to
remove <code>/etc/mtab</code> and link it to <code>/proc/mounts</code>.
However, it was made clear very quickly that one file reflects the users point of
view and the other file reflects the kernel's point of view.  For example, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01832.html">bind
mounts</a>, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01834.html">loopback
mounts</a> and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0206/msg01835.html">disk quotas</a>
are displayed differently.</p>

<p><strong>Red Hat using Debian alternatives.</strong> After reading the
release notes of Red Hat Linux 7.3, Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0206/msg00000.html">reported</a>,
that this distribution includes a port of the Debian alternatives system, as a
way to support multiple packages providing a particular service.  Wichert
Akkerman <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-curiosa-0206/msg00008.html">\
explained</a>, that he's talking with Red Hat about keeping these two
implementations in sync.</p>

<p><strong>Is Linux really Free Software?</strong> In his talk during this
year's <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/3467/">Ottawa Kernel Summit</a> Bdale
Garbee raised the question, whether Debian violates its <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a> by shipping
the Linux kernel?  This issue reflects the inclusion of proprietary firmware
in a number of device drivers.  The consensus during his talk was that this
problem would be best discussed and investigated on the debian-legal list,
where he is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0206/msg00273.html">seeking</a>
assistance.</p>

<p><strong>HTTPS Method for apt-get.</strong> Tomas Pospisek <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-0205/msg00108.html">announced</a> https
support for <code>apt-get</code>.  He <a
href="http://sourcepole.ch/sources/software/apt_https/">implemented</a> it as
patch against version 0.5.4 of apt, which is the current version in Woody.
The upstream developer, however, has some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-0206/msg00007.html">reservations</a>
against including pieces of <code>stunnel</code>.</p>

<p><strong>dpkg 1.10 released.</strong> Finally a new version of
<code>dpkg</code> made it into the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-changes-0206/msg01538.html">\
archive</a>.  This is a long awaited upload which also closes no less than 63
open bugs.  It contains several improvements, like a split off
<code>dselect</code> package with improved handling of Recommends and
Suggests.  It also understands a per-user configuration file.  The entire list
of changes is impressive, you shouldn't forget to read it.</p>

<p><strong>Debian in SpamCop's List.</strong> We have recently been <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00011.html">informed</a>
that <a href="http://spamcop.net/w3m?action=checkblock&amp;ip=65.125.64.135">\
master.debian.org</a> is listed in <a href="http://spamcop.net/">SpamCop's
database</a>.  Marco d'Itri <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0207/msg00044.html">noted</a> that
this database has to be used with special care because mailing lists are
routinely blocked by it.</p>

<p><strong>Final Bits for DebConf2.</strong> Joe Drew released the final <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0206/msg00013.html">\
announcement</a> covering the upcoming <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0705-debconf">Debian Conference 2</a> which will
take place from July 5th to 7th in Toronto, Canada.  In addition to the
Debian-specific talks which make up the majority of the <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/0705-debconf-schedule">program</a>, there are
several non-Debian related.  Among these is Damian Conway, a well-known
speaker and Perl developer will give a talk entitled with <a
href="http://www.dice-con.com/damian/Extreme.html">Extreme Perl</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Another Potato Update on the Way?</strong> Joey sent in a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0207/msg00002.html">\
report</a> about the current work done for another update (r7) to the stable
Debian release (also known as Potato).  Even though Woody will probably be
released soon, Potato is still supported and received a couple of security
updates that should be addressed properly.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-135">libapache-mod-ssl</a> --
    Buffer overflow.
</ul>

<p>After heated debates resulting from the OpenSSH vulnerability, we'd like to
mention a small quote from the <a
href="http://www.openssh.com/txt/preauth.adv">Revised OpenSSH Security
Advisory</a>: The most helpful vendors were OpenWall Linux and Debian.</p>
