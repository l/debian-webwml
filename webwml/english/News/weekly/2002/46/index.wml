# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 46th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Is Free Software suited for governmental use?  Can it
replace the systems currently used?  To examine this, Japan will <a
href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20021120S0002">study</a> the
possibility of using open-source software such as Linux at the government
level.</p>

<p><strong>Debian User Worldmap.</strong> Gürkan Sengün <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-0211/msg03293.html">started</a> to
create a worldmap of Debian users, similar to the one of Debian developers.
Within only two days he received about 150 coordinates and there should be
about 1000 by the release of DWN.  The worldmap is
available in three sizes, 768x384, 2000x1000 and 4000x1000. If you want to be
added, please send in your coordinates to <a
href="mailto:gurkan@linuks.mine.nu">gurkan@linuks.mine.nu</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Server burnt down.</strong> Wichert Akkerman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00009.html">\
reported</a> that a fire started in the computing facilities of <a
href="http://www.twente.nl/">Twente University</a>.  According to the fire
department, everything in the building and the entire building was burnt to
the ground.  The Debian server "satie" that served as security and non-US
archive was hosted there.  Two days later, the Security Team <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-02/msg00124.html">\
reported</a> that the security service was successfully reinstalled on another
server.  The <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">nm</a> and <a
href="http://qa.debian.org/">qa</a> hosts had their home on satie as well and
were also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00013.html">\
reinstalled</a> on klecker.  It has finally been <a
href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/11/25/138216.shtml">confirmed</a> that
the fire was a result of arson.</p>

<p><strong>Debian losing Users to Gentoo?</strong> Andrew Lau was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01974.html">disturbed</a>
by the raising interest in <a href="http://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo Linux</a>
and asked what Debian could learn from Gentoo.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02015.html">pointed out</a>
that Debian already has learnt from it and mentioned <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/apt-src.html">apt-src</a>.
Roberto Suarez Soto, however, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01988.html">added</a> that
several users do not only consider technical issues when chosing their
operating system.</p>

<p><strong>Debian-Installer Status Update.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen provided
an <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0211/msg00640.html">update</a>
on the new installer for sarge.  Michael Cardenas also announced a new <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~mbc/di.html">homepage</a> for it.  The x86 and
S/390 ports are progressing nicely as is i18n.  Work has started on the IA64
port, while the Alpha-Axp and PowerPC ports are stalled.  A lot of work still
needs to be done to get a beta version out by new years eve.  If you'd like to
help please see the <a href="http://raw.no/d-i/getting_started.html">getting
started notes</a> and the <a href="http://url.raw.no/?101">todo list</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Debian at LWE in Frankfurt.</strong> Michael Banck wrote a <a
href="$(HOME)/events/2002/1029-lwe-report">report</a> about the Debian
presence at Linux World Expo and Conference in Frankfurt, Germany, back in
October 2002.  The Debian project got a sponsored booth in the .org pavillon
at the opposite site than the entrance.  Debian people from Germany managed to
use a video projector for real-time demonstrations at the booth.</p>

<p><strong>Applications and Nominations for the SPI Board.</strong> Bdale
Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00007.html">\
advised</a> that <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public
Interest, Inc.</a> (SPI) would like to expand its board of directors.  SPI is
a non-profit organization which was founded to help organizations develop and
distribute open hardware and software.  It provides a legal and financial
existence for Debian and other projects.  SPI Vice-President Martin "Joey"
Schulze is seeking applications and nominations for Board membership and a
special "Assistant" position who would help in maintaining the Corporation,
running meetings and so on.  On Sunday, though, he <a
href="http://lists.spi-inc.org/pipermail/spi-general/2002-November/000505.html">\
stepped down</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Ceasing Dependencies to xlib6g*.</strong> Daniel Schepler <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02325.html">announced</a>
that he would like to file bugs against any source or binary package which
still depends on the obsolete xlib6g* packages.  These bugs will be of normal
severity for now, but will be raised to serious severity (for source packages)
or grave severity (for binary packages) once Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02334.html">pulls the
trigger</a> to finally remove the xlib6g* packages.</p>

<p><strong>APT Manual Pages.</strong> Susan Kleinmann <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-0211/msg00103.html">described</a> how
aspects of the current (0.5.4) apt_preferences manual page are difficult
to understand.  Susan provided a commentary on the first paragraph of the
manual page to show how the documentation could be improved.  She pointed out
that since APT is so central to the effective use of Debian, the APT related
manual pages should be easy to understand.  Susan would like to submit a
revision of the APT preferences man page but is hoping those with more
familiarity with its workings could help out.</p>

<p><strong>Synchronizing apt-get update and dselect update.</strong> A <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-0211/msg00098.html">bug report</a> against
APT was opened, suggesting that the 'apt-get update' command should also
update the dselect database (if it exists).  This would avoid the need for a
separate 'update' run under dselect.  Joey Hess <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/deity-0211/msg00099.html">thought</a> the best
implementation would be a Post-Update hook in apt.conf, which would probably
also have other uses.</p>

<p><strong>License change for Defsystem3.</strong> Earlier this year, Kevin
Rosenberg <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/158320">announced</a> his intention
to package defsystem3 separately from the <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/common-lisp-controller.html">Common
Lisp Controller</a> package.  This brought to light <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00193.html">some
aspects</a> of the defsystem3 license that breached the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG). After discussion with the authors of defsystem3, Kevin
has <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00235.html">\
advised</a> that the license will be amended.  Branden Robinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00236.html">agreed</a> that
the new license complies with the DFSG.</p>

<p><strong>Interview with Klaus Knopper.</strong> Ladislav Bodnar <a
href="http://www.distrowatch.com/interview-knoppix.php">interviewed</a> Klaus
Knopper about his <a href="http://www.knoppix.org/">Knoppix</a> bootable-CD
project.  Klaus suggests using a Knoppix CD to test for hardware compatibility
the next time you go shopping for a computer and explains how hardware
detection is implemented in Knoppix.  Some user groups and institutions have
created language-specific editions (Japanese, Spanish) or are simply using the
hardware detection as a platform for their own projects.</p>

<p><strong>Dependency to new GNU LibC.</strong> Mike Fedyk <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01818.html">wondered</a>
Why new packages in sid depend on the new libc6 from unstable.  He noted that
to install an updated package from unstable a new libc6 package creeped in.
Jason Gunthorpe <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01856.html">\
investigated</a> the current situation and found out packages depend on
several different versions of libc6.  Adam Heath <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg01924.html">added</a> that
the glibc maintainers routinely pull code from CVS.</p>

<p><strong>Release Files in Package Repositories.</strong> Karl Hegbloom <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg02209.html">requested</a>
that <a
href="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/apt-sources/index-list.html">
custom package repositories</a> include a <code>Release</code> file,
especially if they are located on people.debian.org.  This would enable the
users to make use of <a
href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/apt-howto/ch-apt-get.en.html">APT preferences</a> to
pin certain packages to certain versions.</p>

<p><strong>Linux Kernel Licenses.</strong> Giacomo Catenazzi did a complete <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00196.html">check</a> of
Linux kernel licenses.  He put the result up in an FAQ like document and found
a total of 18 different licenses (including "none").  Most of them are free
and compliant with both the DFSG and the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>.</p>
