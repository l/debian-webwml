# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's tenth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  We're very excited to report about the most weird way to
create GUI applications: using PHP.  See below.  Our Danish readers may be
interested in this <a href="http://debianguiden.dk/">Debian guide</a>, which
is a much more in-depth supplement to the official installation manual.</p>

<p><strong>DebConf 2 in Toronto.</strong> Finally, Joe Drew <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00001.html">\
announced</a> that the second Debian Conference will take place from Friday,
July 5, to Sunday, July 7 in Toronto, Ontario in Canada.  That's the weekend
after the <a href="http://www.linuxsymposium.org/">Ottawa Linux Symposium</a>
so people can attend both events.  People who wish to give a presentation or a
talk should contact <a href="mailto:hoserhead@woot.net">Joe Drew</a> as soon
as possible.

<p><strong>Campaigning Period for Leader Election.</strong> Manoj Srivastava,
with the Project Secretary Honorary Hat on, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0202/msg00038.html">reported</a> the
end of the nomination period, with three candidates standing forth to be
counted: <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2002/platforms/bdale">Bdale
Garbee</a>, <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2002/platforms/raphael">\
Raphaël Hertzog</a> and <a
href="$(HOME)/vote/2002/platforms/branden">Branden Robinson</a>.
The platforms from these candidates are online now.  The three week campaign
period is now kicking off.  Watch the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/">debian-vote</a> list.  Many
questions and statements from the candidates are posted there.  Noteworthy is
the following <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0203/msg00087.html">list of
questions</a> to the candidates by Anthony Towns that, as a side effect,
demonstrates the limits of being a Debian Project Leader.</p>

<p><strong>Writing GUI Applications with PHP.</strong> Too often <a
href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> is thought of as only an HTML-embedded web
scripting language.  However, it is also a full-featured general purpose
language that can be used for much more.  One of the goals behind the <a
href="http://gtk.php.net/">PHP-GTK project</a> was to prove that PHP can be
used to write client-side GUI applications.  This project doesn't allow you to
create web applications with GTK but standalone GUI applications and start
them with <code>php4 -q hello.php</code> as if you were using Perl/Gtk,
Python/Gtk or similar.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Status.</strong> Anthony Towns released another <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0203/msg00002.html">status
report</a> about the Woody release.  The release critical (RC) bug list is
down to 200 and another set of packages was removed from Woody.  For people
who want to help with RC bugs, there are two different RC bug lists: the <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/">traditional one</a> and the <a
href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/testing_probs.html">one</a> that
gives an indication of how buggy the versions of the packages in testing are.
People interested in making sure packages they're interested in don't get
thrown out are encouraged to peruse both lists if they have spare time.</p>

<p><strong>GNU/Linux Web Browser Review.</strong> Recently, Rob Valliere
<a href="../../oldurl?http://www.robval.com/linux/2002/browsers.html">reviewed</a>
web browsers
available on GNU/Linux distributions including Debian GNU/Linux.  A lot of
significant development effort has been made to <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/embedding/examples/galeon.html">Galeon</a>,
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> and <a
href="http://www.konqueror.org/">Konqueror</a> for the past few months.  The
browsers that impressed him most are Galeon 1.0.3, Mozilla 0.9.8 and Opera 6.0
TP3 (which is not available in Debian GNU/Linux since it is non-free).</p>

<p><strong>Gnome-Print Caused Trouble in Sid.</strong> Gnome packages didn't
work as well as they should recently, due to problems with Gnome core
packages.  Because of a <a
href="../../oldurl?http://debianplanet.org/article.php?sid=611">dependency issue</a>
affecting <code>libgnomeprint*</code> packages, most of the core Gnome
packages were removed.  It seems that there were circular dependencies on
gnome-print, which were resolved later.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Notes.</strong> Robert Bradford is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg00104.html">working</a> on
new <a href="$(HOME)/releases/woody/i386/release-notes/">release
notes</a> for the Woody release.  He gathers help from people for details with
regard to porting Debian to non-ia32 platforms, split and renamed packages and
general problems and fixes.  As an example, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0203/msg00113.html">here</a> are
release notes about XFree86 for Woody.  If you can help Robert, please drop
him a line at <a href="mailto:rob@debianplanet.org">\
rob@debianplanet.org</a>.</p>
