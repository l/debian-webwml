# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 43rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  This week we are pleased to include items by Matt Black and
David Kimdon.  A <a href="http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/2002/11/012">\
survey</a> about trends in the information technology of the German computer
magazine iX shows Debian as an outperformer among the GNU/Linux distributions
with a growth from 6&nbsp;% to 20&nbsp;% compared with the last survey.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Security Survey.</strong> A member of the security team sent
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00001.html">\
letter</a> trying to gather information about what users and organisations
think about and expect from the Debian Security Team.  Since the security team
naturally cannot support potato endlessly, security updates for potato will
end some day.  However, there are still organisations that cannot simply
upgrade their potato environment to woody, hence, some negotiation is
required.</p>

<p><strong>Is Debian an Anarchist Organization?</strong> Jonathan Walther <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg02466.html">heard</a> some
people saying that the Debian project is a good example of anarchy in action.
He wanted to know what to tell people who ask if Debian is anarchic?  Sean
Perry <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg02468.html">\
wondered</a> how a group of people numbering around a thousand and at any one
point in time having at least a hundred active members could claim to be
anarchistic?  He also points out that anarchy like dictatorship is an extreme
and extremes do not work well with people.  Russell Coker <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg02469.html">acknowledged</a>
that Debian has some anarchistic tendencies, though.</p>

<p><strong>Installing and Configuring ALSA Sound Modules.</strong> Linux Orbit
<a
href="http://www.linuxorbit.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=541">\
explains</a> how to install and configure ALSA sound modules with Debian
GNU/Linux.  The HOWTO starts with compiling a custom kernel and modules and
continues with a detailed explanation how to set up ALSA using the script
provided by Debian so that modules are automatically loaded and unloaded, and
your mixer levels are saved and restored on boot up.</p>

<p><strong>Update for the Woody Distribution.</strong> More than three months
after Debian 3.0 was released the stable release manager <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0211/msg00002.html">\
sent</a> a status report about his <a
href="http://master.debian.org/~joey/3.0r1/">preparations</a> for an update of
the stable distribution.  The update will mostly consist of security updates
but also include updates to packages that got lost during the freeze of
woody.</p>

<p><strong>Files in /usr/share must be World-Readable.</strong> Matthew Swift
filed a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00110.html">general bug</a>
suggesting that all files in /usr/share ought to be world-readable since they
are to be shared among different machines.  He also pointed out that this is a
requirement in the <a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard</a>.  For example, Matthew had found that certain files from several
packages were not world-readable.  Steve Greenland <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00148.html">replied</a>
that the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s11.9">Debian
policy</a> already requires this.</p>

<p><strong>TWAIN Image Acquisition for Debian.</strong> Bdale Garbee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0210/msg02617.html">announced</a>
that he has received a request from the <a href="http://www.twain.org/">TWAIN
Working Group</a> for a contact to work with in Debian.  They want to know how
a new port of the TWAIN drivers to Unix and GNU/Linux could best be made
available to Debian users.  Bdale's personal needs are currently adequately
met by the SANE driver and it's been a long time since he looked at anything
TWAIN related, so he asks if anyone is interested?</p>

<p><strong>Setting up a Debian Log Server.</strong> Vincent Hillier has
written an <a href="http://plutonium.homeunix.com/papers/dls.pdf">article</a>
about how to deploy a remote logging server using Debian.  The article is
quite detailed with an emphasis on securing the server to ensure it is not
compromised.  The target audience is newcomers to GNU/Linux, although
experienced users should find it to be a good reference.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up X-Terminals with Debian.</strong> Alan W. Irwin wrote <a
href="http://www.vlug.org/vlug/meetings/X-terminal_presentation/details.html">\
instructions</a> for setting up GNU/Linux-based X-Terminals with Debian.  The
goal is to run all your X clients (KDE, GNOME, OpenOffice, etc.) in a
transparent manner on a powerful computer and simply use a slow computer (the
X-Terminal) to display the results and control that display with keyboard and
mouse.  This setup is particularly useful for bringing an old PC back to
useful life.</p>

<p><strong>Licensing Issues with UnrealIRCd.</strong> Mika Fischer <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00304.html">asked</a> for
advice on a new UnrealIRCd license clause that seemed to imply that the
license could be modified retrospectively.  Branden Robinson and others <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00310.html">pointed out</a>
that this would violate the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">\
Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> (DFSG).  Branden was also <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00313.html">concerned</a>
about the apparent requirement for a <em>click-through</em> license acceptance
ceremony.  Mika talked to the UnrealIRCd author, who <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00341.html">amended</a> the
license to clarify that it was not meant to apply retrospectively.  However,
Branden <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00348.html">\
feels</a> that the requirement of a click-through license acceptance ceremony,
if in fact it is a requirement, could be problematic.</p>

<p><strong>Does the Source CD1 correspond to Binary CD1?</strong> The GNU <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a> <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/vendors/legal">requires</a> somebody distributing binaries to
also provide the source code or an offer (valid for three years) to provide
that source code.  Blars Blarson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0210/msg00144.html">wondered</a>
whether the entire source code for woody's first binary CD could be found on
the first source CD, or whether he would need to grab all the source CDs in
order to distribute the first binary CD.  Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0211/msg00001.html">advised</a> that
although source packages are generally added to CDs in a similar order as the
binary packages, there are several reasons why the CDs will not exactly
correspond.  People who do not wish to redistribute the full set of Debian CDs
could generate their own CD of matching source code if they wish to avoid
collecting the entire set of source code CDs.</p>

<p><strong>Low-cost Computing for Rural Spain.</strong> The Washington Post <a
href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A59197-2002Nov2.html">\
reports</a> about a Debian-based <a href="http://www.linex.org/">\
distribution</a> for the Extremadura, a rural region of western Spain.  To
eliminate some of the headaches, the Extremadura government paid a Spanish
company, to take one of the free versions of GNU/Linux and make it suitable
for public distribution.  It is great to see Debian's ease of <a
href="http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,51994,00.html">customization</a>
and open structure put to such good use.  With so many Debian-based
distributions popping up perhaps we need a more organized way of pulling fixes
and enhancements back into Debian.</p>

<p><strong>Leaving the LZW Algorithm in Source Files?</strong> Chris Halls <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00244.html">asked</a> if he
may leave a source file that implements a patented algorithm (LZW compression
for GIFs) in the source tarball for OpenOffice.org.  The file is not built or
distributed in the binary packages, though.  Walter Landry <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00251.html">claims</a> that
you are not allowed to distribute an implementation of a patent and Branden
Robinson <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00273.html">\
added</a> that Debian should not be shipping anything in "main" that isn't
DFSG-free.</p>

<p><strong>Problems with Wordlist.</strong> Kevin Atkinson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0211/msg00018.html">reported</a>
that due to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0210/msg00204.html">discussion</a>
of a possible problem with the license for aspell-en, the new version 0.50 may
not get uploaded to Debian.  One of the included wordlists comes from the DEC
Systems Research Center which has a license that is not DFSG-compliant as
written.</p>

<p><strong>Re-Packaging GNOME 1.</strong> Josselin Mouette <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00006.html">stated</a> that
he is willing to make it possible to install Gnome 1 on a Debian system,
without confliciting with Gnome 2.  He believes that the GNOME desktop version
2 lacks large parts of GNOME 1.4's functionality, and suffers from
incompatibilities.  Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0211/msg00014.html">pondered</a> if
it wouldn't be better to just work on adding back missing functionality.</p>
