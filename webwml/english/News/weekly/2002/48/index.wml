# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 48th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00162.html">confusion</a>
was caused by a wildcard dns record in the .org.com domain.  A sleep-deprived
James Treacy proudly <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-0212/msg00088.html">announced</a> the
birth of his two daughters, Jacqueline and Claire.  People told him that he
should get his life back in about 20 years.</p>

<p><strong>Changing the Bug Submitter Address.</strong> Colin Watson <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0212/msg00001.html">\
announced</a> that the <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bug tracking system</a>
supports a new command to change the bug submitter address.  The old method,
closing the bug and reopening it with a different submitter address, is now
deprecated.  Instead there is now a <code>submitter</code> command that can
also use the address from the From: or Reply-To: header.  The address
previously recorded as the submitter will be notified of the change.</p>

<p><strong>Additional TuxRacer Courses.</strong> Andreas Tille <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00216.html">reported</a>
that he has <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/packages/tuxracer-courses/">\
uploaded</a> Debian packages of additional TuxRacer courses.  The packages do
not yet meet the Debian quality requirements regarding the necessary
documentation but they work.  Unfortunately, the license for many of them is
not clear and the author is not traced <a
href="http://tuxracer.fubaby.com/courses.php">upstream</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Writing Packages' Descriptions.</strong> Colin Walters <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00252.html">reported</a>
that the package descriptions are a very important product of this project.
They're going to be one of the first things people see when they use Debian,
and their quality directly reflects on the quality of Debian.  He finally sat
down and committed his thoughts on <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/descriptions.html">description
writing</a> in a semi-coherent form.</p>

<p><strong>Xconfigurator for Debian?</strong> Amir Bukhari <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00285.html">reported</a>
that he intends to port Xconfigurator from Red Hat to Debian, if that will
help Debian to provide an easier X configuration.  However, the new Debian
installation process will make heavy use of debconf.  Plugging in a totally
different kind of configuration tool might not be feasible.  But without
trying we can't know.</p>

<p><strong>Scripts for Building CD Images.</strong> Martin Sjögren <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0212/msg00153.html">advised</a> that
he has made available the <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~sjogren/d-i/">scripts</a> he uses for building
CD images based on the new debian-installer.  Martin's <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~sjogren/d-i/_README">README</a> explains all
the steps involved in putting together a small CD image.  This should help
testing the debian-installer, which still needs a lot of work.</p>

<p><strong>Building CD Images without Contrib.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0212/msg00058.html">wrote</a> a patch
against the debian-cd package to allow building a CD image without including
the contrib archive.  Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0212/msg00064.html">agreed</a> that
this was a good idea, as long as inclusion of contrib remained the default.
At first he thought it might be an idea to remove contrib automatically if
non-free was removed, however, it was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0212/msg00062.html">pointed out</a>
that packages such as OpenOffice.org are in contrib but do not depend on
non-free parts.</p>

<p><strong>Create your first Debian Package.</strong> Clemens Lee <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-doc-0212/msg00000.html">announced</a>
that a new <a
href="http://www.kclee.com/clemens/unix/HowToCreateYourOwnDebianPackage.html">\
Mini-HOWTO</a> entitled "How to Create Your First Debian Package".  This
document describes how to create a Debian package for installation on one's
own computer, rather than for inclusion into the official Debian archives.
The <a href="$(HOME)/doc/maint-guide/">Debian New Maintainers' Guide</a>
describes the official process.</p>

<p><strong>Enforcing Software Licenses.</strong> Lawrence Rosen, general
counsel for the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source
Initiative</a>, wrote an <a
href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=6409">article</a> about the
enforceability of software licenses.  In particular, he discusses the issue of
proving that somebody assented to be bound by the terms of a contract so that
those terms will be enforced by a court.  Authors who wish to be able to
enforce license terms against users of their source code or compiled programs
may find this interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Scripts for Creating private Debian Package Pools.</strong> Brian
May <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0212/msg00475.html">\
advised</a> that he has prepared a set of <a
href="http://www.microcomaustralia.com.au/debian/bin2/">scripts</a> that can
be used to facilitate the creation of a private Debian archive.  The scripts
allow one to create and maintain multiple distributions, architectures
etc.</p>

<p><strong>First Alpha Release of the debian-installer.</strong> Tollef Fog
Heen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0212/msg00002.html">\
announced</a> the first <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~sjogren/d-i/local-di-sarge.iso">alpha
release</a> for the new Debian installer.  The release is only available for
i386 and supports both net-based and CD-ROM-based installations.  The
installation currently only supports a line-based configuration since
frontends using S-Lang or GTK are not yet ready.  If you try the installer and
discover problems, please file a bug against the pseudo-package
"installation-reports" using this <a \
href="http://raw.no/d-i/report-template.html">template</a>.</p>

<p><strong>KDE 3.1 delayed for Security.</strong> For those who waited for KDE
3.1, its release manager Dirk Mueller <a
href="http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-core-devel&amp;m=103913196531620">\
reported</a> that it has been delayed until next year.  The <a
href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> team was informed about security problems
and would rather audit their code than release a vulnerable version.  We
appreciate their effort.</p>

<p> <strong>FSF on W3C's proposed patent policy.</strong> The <a
href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> (FSF) has <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/w3c-patent.html">examined</a> the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium's</a> (W3C) proposed
patent policy and found it wanting.  The <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2002/WD-patent-policy-20021114/">proposed
policy</a> allows for a "field of use" restriction which is incompatible with
the GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public
License</a>.  The <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-patentpolicy-comment/">comments
archive</a> shows few comments from Debian developers and users.  W3C is
accepting comments from the public until 31st December, 2002, at <a
href="mailto:www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org">\
www-patentpolicy-comment@w3.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>First Update for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.</strong> The first update
for the current stable distribution, which was released in July, is still in
preparation.  The stable release manager sent an updated <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0212/msg00003.html">\
report</a> about the current status of the <a
href="http://master.debian.org/~joey/3.0r1/">preparations</a>.  The update
will mostly consist of security updates but also include updates to packages
that got lost during the freeze of woody and fix some broken packages.</p>

that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>
