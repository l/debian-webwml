# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's eighth issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter to the
Debian community.  We've received promising news with regard to the Woody
release, but please see below.  In case you've missed this week's flamebait on
our release structure, here's the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01069.html">link</a> to the
thread.</p>

<p><strong>New Upload System.</strong> James Troup finally <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00006.html">\
revealed</a> the gory details of the new structure and implementation of the
Incoming directories into which new packages are uploaded, before they are
processed and installed into the Debian archive.  The main advantage of this
change is that only those packages that will be installed by the next archive
run will be publicly visible through
<a href="http://incoming.debian.org/">incoming.debian.org</a>.
This change was required to let
crypto-enabled software enter the main archive.  It is installed on the non-US
server and will eventually be installed on ftp-master after it has proven
stability.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on Top of Sun Solaris.</strong> John Groenveld started a <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/30553">discussion</a>
covering a Debian system running within a Solaris box.  However, his proposal
does not include running Debian natively on the architecture but in
SunPC/bochs.  This would open Sun's customers the world of Linux binaries
and more applications, even on the non-x86 architecture, that other companies
don't plan to support with their applications.  Somebody else <a
href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/solarisonintel/message/30574">added</a> an
interesting view about the Debian project: "Their [the package maintainers]
personal reputation is on the line if a package isn't updated/fixed/etc."</p>

<p><strong>New Stable Revision (r6) in Preparation.</strong> In another quixotic
attempt, Joey is again <a href="http://master.debian.org/~joey/2.2r6/">\
working</a> on an update to the stable Debian version (alias 2.2).  The list
of packages contains no less than eleven security uploads currently.  Joey's
plan is to get the sixth revision out at the beginning of March.  However the
new incoming system could put a spoke into this wheel.  If you would like to
add a comment to the list, please drop him a line.</p>

<p><strong>Unofficial Woody Image for Mini CDs.</strong> Ho-seok Lee developed
an unofficial small CD image for the i386 architecture that fits on a 3.5" CD
which takes about 180MB.  The image was created manually and contains <a
href="http://www.debian.or.kr/~alee/cdimages/woody.list.txt">280 Debian
packages</a> including packages like Sawfish, IceWM, XMMS and the Linux kernel
2.4.17 supporting ReiserFS, Ext3FS and the PPPoE module for ADSL users.
This entire image can be downloaded from <a
href="http://www.debian.or.kr/~alee/cdimages/woody.iso">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Woody Release Status.</strong> Anthony Towns sent in a new <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00012.html">status
report</a> about the upcoming Woody release.  The good news are that the base
system is back in good shape.  There are still bugs in some important
packages, but most of these seem fairly controllable.  The bad news are that
several packages still come with release critical (RC) bugs which means that
they will be getting randomly ripped out of testing.  If packages you're
interested in having accumulated RC bugs the maintainer and you have almost run
out of time to get them fixed if you want them released.</p>

<p><strong>SPAM on Debian Lists.</strong> The mailing lists, that the Debian
project provides, are open and anybody can send mail to most of them.  Since
their addresses are publicly available, they are abused by spammers as well,
unfortunately.  There is not much we can do about this besides trying to
filter out as much as we can and closing the lists.  While we are already
doing the first, we won't do the latter.  We appreciate people complaining
about spammers, but please, please, please think thrice about where you are
sending the complaint to.  Here is yet another <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01014.html">example</a> of
a subscriber of a Debian owned mailing list filing spam complaints against <a
href="http://www.brainfood.com/">Brainfood</a> for spam on Debian lists.</p>

<p><strong>Autobuilding Debian?</strong> Have you ever wondered if it would be
possible to rebuild all Debian packages from source?  Theoretically speaking,
this should be possible.  Many packages provide Build-Depends that describe
which packages need to be installed before a package can be built.  Junichi
Uekawa <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0202/msg01190.html">\
used</a> an Athlon 900 with 512 MB of memory that tried to rebuild all Debian
packages.  4114 packages were built successfully while 375 packages didn't.
That's pretty impressive.</p>

<p><strong>Report From Last Weekends Bug-Squashing Party.</strong> Colin
Watson <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0202/msg00013.html">\
reports</a> that the seventh Bug-Squashing Party (BSP) attracted a substantial
number of existing developers, applicants, and users.  The release critical
(RC) bug count has dropped from 442 on Friday morning to the current level of
331, a large amount of which was due to bug-squashers providing patches and/or
Non-Maintainer-Uploads (NMUs).  The delayed incoming directory currently
contains fixes for 72 bugs (many of them are RC).</p>

<p><strong>Mirrors Recovering after the Rsync Breakage.</strong> Josip Rodin
<a href="mail#mail1">reports</a> that most
Debian mirrors recuperated automatically after the last rsync breakage.  This
was anticipated since <code>rsync</code> was fixed a while ago and should
detect broken files.  He also tells us that there are currently 290 officially
registered Debian mirrors.  All mirror maintainers are encouraged
to investigate what's been <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">changed</a>
since the last time they checked.</p>
