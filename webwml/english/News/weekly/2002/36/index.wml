# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 36th issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  We are happy to include two items from Richard Wale this
time.  It was recently <a href="http://www.pro-linux.de/news/2002/4664.html">\
reported</a> (German only) that the German <a
href="http://www.bundeskartellamt.de/english_.html">Federal Cartel Office</a>
will use a modified Debian system on their <a
href="http://www.natural-computing.de/inhalte_d/produkt/produkt_sites/desktop.html">\
desktop computers</a> (German only) system and servers.</p>

<p><strong>Debian supporting Sincere Choice?</strong> Gustavo Noronha Silva <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0209/msg00035.html">asked</a>
whether the Debian project is going to support <a
href="http://www.sincerechoice.com/">Sincere Choice</a>, which was recently
founded by former Debian project leader Bruce Perens.  Sincere Choice is a
political platform for projects and individuals who believe that there should
be a fair, competitive market for computer software, both proprietary and Open
Source.  It was founded in response to a <a
href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/4/26616.html">clever fraud</a>.</p>

<p><strong>XFree86 4.2.x.</strong> Branden and his X Strike Force colleagues
continue to work towards a 4.2.x release for Debian, with new "experimental"
pre-release <a href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/">packages</a>.  He
also <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0209/msg00038.html">\
responded</a> to the recently announced Xlib security hole; Debian is not
affected as "XFree86 4.2.0 hasn't been released to it yet." Since then he has
released packages for <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-x-0209/msg00050.html">XFree86 4.2.1-0pre1v1</a>,
which contains the fix.</p>

<p><strong>Debian on RS/6000.</strong> After the recent pSeries-related
activity on the PowerPC mailing list <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-powerpc-0208/msg00486.html">proposing</a>
a kernel repository for "working" kernels for RS/6000 machines, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0209/msg00063.html">discussion</a>
jumped from debian-powerpc to debian-boot suggesting that CHRP/PReP kernels be
revised to work towards a set of working install floppies.  While no timescales are
mentioned, the consensus seems to be the current CHRP/PReP kernels are broken
(where RS6K's are concerned) and need <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0209/msg00065.html">investigation</a>
and reworking.  Hopefully over time, Debian will become more viable on the
pSeries platform.</p>

<p><strong>Status of Perl 5.8.0 Update.</strong> Brendan O'Dea <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-perl-0209/msg00012.html">reported</a>
that the transition to Perl 5.8.0 in the unstable distribution (sid) is
almost complete.  Three architectures haven't rebuilt the packages, but for
those that were released with woody, this should probably be fixed by the most
recent source package.  Brendan lists five remaining packages that still
suffer from dependency problems.  In general the transition went as smoothly
as possible.</p>

<p><strong>How can I help?</strong> Several people have shown that they don't
know how to help to improve Debian.  Not all people raise their voice when they
are swamped and need help.  To help, we provide some links to common
resources.  To improve the quality of Debian, see this small <a
href="http://qa.debian.org/howto.html">HOWTO</a> document.  If would like to
spend time on packaging, the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/wnpp/">wnpp</a> list
(Work-Needing and Prospective Packages) refers to packages that require work.
As a general task, the debian-installer requires <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0207/msg00013.html">\
assistance</a> with non-i386 architectures.  For those who would like to work
on the web services, this <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/todo">list</a> contains
tasks for the website.  Finally, here's a list of overall <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/jobs.html">tasks</a> that require
help.</p>

<p><strong>GNOME Transition Stagnated.</strong> A while ago we reported about
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0208/msg00000.html">ongoing</a>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0207/msg00450.html">\
discussions</a> that <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0208/msg00021.html">deal</a>
with the process of adding GNOME 2 to the Debian archive.  Finally, a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0209/msg00000.html">discussion</a>
was held on IRC involving the technical committee (ctte) and the GNOME release
manager.  It seems that people agree to keep GNOME 1 libraries as long as
possible and that GNOME 2 should replace GNOME 1 at some stage in the
future.  However, it doesn't seem to be decided yet where to develop GNOME 2
packages.  Raphaël would rather like to see a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0209/msg00018.html">decision</a> by
the Technical Committee rather than <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0209/msg00021.html">\
implementing</a> a staging area.</p>

<p><strong>Discussing the Task System.</strong> Eduard Bloch started a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg00643.html">discussion</a>
about the task system and proposed to add more tasks for the user.  This
includes a division between GNOME, KDE and plain X11 and basic internet
clients for X11 or the text console.  It turned out that the scope of the task
system isn't clearly defined.  Some people believe that it should help new
users install software without knowing details, while others believe that
tasks exist to install large chunks of software in one batch.</p>

<p><strong>Debian Jobs Database.</strong> Andreas Müller <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0209/msg01124.html">reported</a>
that he finished implementing a <a href="http://jobs.debian.net/">job
database</a> for Debian and asked for a public beta test.  This is a job
database for Debian related jobs, based on a Debian-LAMP system.  The database
aims at both companies that seek new employees as well as people seeking a new
employer.</p>

<p><strong>Blender is Free Software.</strong> After the company behind <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/blender">Blender</a>,
a very fast and versatile 3D modeller and renderer, went bankrupt, the <a
href="http://www.blender3d.com/">Blender Foundation</a> was created.  The
purpose was to secure and maintain the Blender source.  100,000 Euro were
required to purchase the source from the company, and this was donated by
many <a href="http://vrotvrot.com/openBlender/donations/list.php">\
volunteers</a> from around the world.  To celebrate this, a <a
href="http://www.blender3d.com/conference.html">conference</a> will be held in
October, closing with a party at which Blender 2.26 will be released as free
software.</p>

newsletter.  Currently, it's mostly a one-man show, which is anticipated to
fail in the long term.  We urgently need volunteer writers who prepare items.
Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/contributing">contributing
