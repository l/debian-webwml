# $Id$

<p>Welcome to this year's 33rd issue of DWN, the weekly newsletter for the
Debian community.  Many developers still seem to be enjoying their holidays so the
lists are quite silent, compared to other times of the year.  After large
numbers complaints that were posted on <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project-0208/msg00046.html">debian-project</a>,
<a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/02/08/17/2147232.shtml">Slashdot</a> and
<a href="http://www.debianplanet.org/node.php?id=774#comment">Debian
Planet</a>, Rob Levin, head of the network in question, finally <a
href="info">announced</a> that global
notices for fundraising will stop.</p>

<p><strong>Reviving a Constitutional Amendment.</strong> In December 2000,
Raul Miller <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0012/msg00073.html">\
proposed</a> a General Resolution (GR) to fix the voting process as defined in
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">constitution</a>.  The
GR was withdrawn until a committee assigned to study the problem returned with
a recommendation.  The Debian Project Secretary, Manoj Srivastava, recently <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0208/msg00007.html">revived</a> the
discussion.</p>

<p><strong>OpenLDAP and TLS/SSL.</strong> Torsten Landschoff was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01350.html">pondering</a>
whether he should enable SSL support in OpenLDAP.  This, however, results in a
priority problem since <code>libldap2</code> uses a higher priority in the
Debian archive than <code>libssl0.9.6</code>.  Hence, either of these packages
need to have their priority changed.  Creating two packages is not really
an option since the number of <code>-ssl</code> packages should be fewer now that
crypto is permitted to go into the main archive.</p>

<p><strong>On the new GCC 3.2.</strong> Gerhard Tonn started rebuilding all
packages that depend on C++ on S/390. The <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01473.html">results</a> are
not looking very good, since more than a third of all affected packages <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~gt/gcc-3.2_transition/failed/">failed</a> to
build at all.  However, several packages failed to build due to problems not
directly connected to GCC 3.2.  Gerhard <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01609.html">agreed</a>
to write bug reports for build problems that are not GCC 3.2 specific.</p>

<p><strong>Python 2.2 as the default Version?</strong> Matthias Klose <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01479.html">proposed</a> to
change the default Python version in Debian unstable to Version 2.2.  When
preparing packages for multiple versions of Python, Matthias asks maintainers
to drop python1.5 support and consider providing support for the experimental
python2.3 packages.</p>

<p><strong>Dock Apps packaging.</strong> Josselin Mouette finally <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01500.html">proposed</a>
how to package WindowMaker dock apps for Debian.  Basically, dock apps from
the same category will be included in one package.  The proposed packages
include many dock apps which are already in the archive.</p>

<p><strong>Supporting Gnome 2.</strong> There are <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0208/msg00000.html">ongoing</a> <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0207/msg00450.html">discussions</a>
that <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-gtk-gnome-0208/msg00021.html">\
deal</a> with the process of adding Gnome 2 to the Debian archive.  It is not
yet decided whether there will be both Gnome 1 and Gnome 2 in Debian, since both
possibilities are problematic.  It's been said that some applications won't start
with Gnome 2, and supporting both versions will create new integrity and
namespace problems.  Ian Jackson eventually proposed a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte-0208/msg00030.html">resolution</a>.</p>

<p><strong>New Sun Documentation License.</strong> Peter Novodvorsky <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00267.html">wondered</a>
whether this <a
href="http://www.openoffice.org/licenses/pdl.pdf">license</a>, which
is going to be used for OpenOffice.Org documentation, is compliant with the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">DFSG</a> (Debian Free
Software Guidelines).  This actually seems to be the case.  However, Branden
Robinson <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00291.html">\
pointed out</a> that it could be argued that the license de facto imposes
further restrictions by the choice of law clause and an increasingly hostile
situation against Free Software in the U.S.A.</p>

<p><strong>Are Word Lists Copyrightable?</strong> Bas Zoetekouw was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00268.html">seeking</a>
advice for packaging a dutch aspell dictionary, which itself lacks a license,
but seems to be based upon a package which is licensed under the <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>,
even though it uses a non-free word list.  Richard Stallman <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00288.html">agreed</a> that
word lists seem to be copyrightable.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Rid of non-free Packers.</strong> Juhapekka Tolvanen <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal-0208/msg00337.html">wondered</a>
why Debian still ships non-free packers.  Different packers than the commonly
used <code>gzip</code> or <code>bzip2</code> are required to uncompress
archives like <code>arj</code>, <code>rar</code>, <code>lha</code>,
<code>zoo</code> or <code>ace</code>.  They are especially useful when somebody
would like to listen to music modules made under other operating systems
or when virus scanners are required to examine many compressed formats,
too.  Juhapekka investigated the situation and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0208/msg01501.html">found</a>,
that there are some free alternatives which only need to be packaged, or
be ported, or completed.  For packers with license or patent issues it would be
necessary to contact the authors and ask for DFSG compliant modifications.</p>

<p><strong>The debian-installer Runs Again.</strong> Tollef Fog Heen released
another <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0208/msg00453.html">\
status report</a> on the debian-installer effort.  The most important news is
that cdebconf has been fixed and now works like a charm.  The second most
important piece of news is that support for multiple architectures has begun, since
Colin Walters is working on the PowerPC port and Wartan Hachaturow is working
on the Alpha port.  Currently, it is <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot-0208/msg00459.html">questionable</a>,
though, if a reduced libc will be possible.</p>

<p><strong>First Bug Squashing Party.</strong> Raphaël Hertzog <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0208/msg00005.html">\
announced</a> the first bug squashing party for the sarge distribution.  It
will take place during the upcoming weekend, from August 30th to September
2nd.  Raphaël explains that the number of <a
href="http://bugs.debian.net/index.pmz?name=ALL">release critical bugs</a> in
sarge is already too high for a release and we aim to a short release
cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Security Updates.</strong> You know the drill.  Please make sure
that you update your systems if you have any of these packages installed.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-155">kdelibs</a> --
    Privacy escalation with Konqueror.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-156">epic-script-light</a> --
    Arbitrary script execution.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-157">irssi-text</a> --
    Denial of service.
<li><a href="$(HOME)/security/2002/dsa-158">Gaim</a> --
    Arbitrary program execution.
</ul>

added to the Debian archive recently or contain important updates.</p>
