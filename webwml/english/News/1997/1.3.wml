<p>
	Debian GNU/Linux is a free-software Linux distribution. Its
	creators are 200 unpaid volunteers from all over the world who
	collaborate via the Internet. Our goal is to keep Linux free.
	While other Linux distributions make their systems more and more
	dependent on commercial software, Debian is 100% free, and
	always will be!

<p>
	This release introduces several new features:

<ul type=circle>
<li>
	Debian is striving for better integration of the entire system.
	Two examples of this are an automatic menu system, (the
	<tt>menu</tt> package), and a built-in web server for
	documentation (the <tt>dwww</tt> package). Each package that is
	installed can automatically add its menu entry to your window
	manager, and its documentation to the web server.  These
	features exist in prototype form in Debian 1.3 .
<br>
<li>
	We have organized a large formal testing team. We have put more
	energy into testing and quality of the released software than
	ever before.  This will be evident in the quality of your Debian
	GNU/Linux system.
<br>
<li>
	This is the first Debian release to have an <strong>Official
	CD</strong>. Our <strong>Official Debian GNU/Linux Two-CD
	Set</strong> is different from all others in that anyone can
	duplicate and sell the Official Debian 2-CD Set without any fee
	from us! Debian will provide the Official CD "masters" to all CD
	manufacturers at no charge via FTP, or on CD-writable ready to
	take to the duplication house, shipped overnight, for a $50
	handling fee. We have taken this step to make sure that our free
	Linux system is available everywhere at a fair price.
<br>
<li>
	We've <em>gotten real</em>! Until now, Debian was a large
	informal organization, with no treasury or incorporation, and
	only one real officer. We have submitted our incorporation
	papers to the State of New York. As soon as the State returns
	them, we'll file with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service to be a
	501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit. This status will let us handle
	tax-exempt donations and grants for the development of Linux.
	Since everything we do is free software, our work will benefit
	all Linux users.  For information on how to donate money to
	Debian, see <A href="$(HOME)/donations.html">
	http://www.debian.org/donations.html</A> .
<br>
<li>
	A distinguishing feature of Debian is the most comprehensive
	package system available for any Unix or Linux system. Debian
	was the first Linux distribution to provide a package system
	with dependencies, a feature that has been copied by all but one
	of the leading Linux distributions. Our package system is
	technically superior to that of any Linux system. We were the
	first to provide automatic conversion of package types, and you
	can automatically convert RPM and Slackware packages to Debian
	ones. A program to convert Debian packages to RPM is available,
	but not yet in the release.
<br>
<li>
	There are ports of Debian GNU/Linux 1.3 to the m68k, ALPHA, and
	SPARC, and a PowerPC port is just starting. Installation disks
	already exist for most of these ports, however we have not
	released them because they do not yet meet the standard set by
	our i386 release. If you'd like to download and test the
	unreleased ports, you can get it from most of the FTP sites
	listed at <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/ftplist">
	http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</a>.
<br>
<li>
	There are two versions of the Debian distribution: the
	<tt>stable</tt>, and the <tt>development</tt> version. The
	<tt>stable</tt> directory currently contains Debian GNU/Linux
	1.3.0 . Point releases of <tt>stable</tt> happen every few weeks
	as bug-fixes are submitted, but there are no large changes until
	the next major release. The <tt>development</tt> version is
	where we are building Debian 2.0 . The development directory is
	updated continuously, and you can retrieve packages from the
	<tt>development</tt> archive on our FTP sites and use them to
	upgrade your system at any time. Thus, users who need stability
	are well-supported, and those who wish to be constantly at the
	leading edge are accommodated just as well.

	FTP Sites

<p>
	Debian FTP sites are everywhere from Kansas to Croatia!
	<br>
	A list of them is available at

	http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</A>.

<p>
	The installation floppy disk images and a full installation
	manual are in the <tt>Debian-1.3/disks-i386/current</tt>

	subdirectory on these sites.

<p>
<font size=+2 color=blue>
	To Upgrade From an Older Debian System
</font>

<p>
	This section is only for people who are upgrading an older
	<strong>Debian</strong> system. Everyone else must follow the
	instructions under <A href="#inst-new">Installing a New Debian
	System</A>. You can upgrade automatically via FTP, or from CD or
	disk. With this release, it is very important to upgrade our
	<tt>dpkg</tt> package tool first, before you upgrade other
	packages in an older Debian system. To do this, change into the
	<tt>Debian-1.3/binary-i386/base</tt> directory on your CD or use
	FTP or some other means to get the <tt>.deb</tt> files mentioned
	below. As root, run these commands:

<pre>
	 dpkg --clear-avail
	 dpkg -i ldso_*.deb
	 dpkg -i libc5_*.deb
	 dpkg -i dpkg_*.deb dpkg-ftp_*.deb
	 dpkg --purge --force-depends texbin
</pre>

<p>
	Once that has been done, you should be able to upgrade the
	entire system automatically using our <tt>dselect</tt> tool. If
	you are connected to the Internet you will not need to retrieve
	any other files manually, <tt>dselect</tt> will automatically
	retrieve and install the rest of Debian 1.3 for you.

<p>
	If you upgrade from Debian 1.1 to Debian 1.3, on a system where
	Debian 1.2 has never been installed, you can expect to run
	dselect about 4 times to complete the installation. There will
	be a number of error messages leading to termination of
	<tt>dselect</tt>, but these are an artifact of the package order
	and your skipped upgrade to 1.2, and can be safely ignored.

	Questions and Answers
</font>

<p>
	<strong>
	How should Debian be compared to other Linux systems?
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	Debian 1.3 is at least as good as any other Unix or Linux
	distribution, even the most professional. One major difference
	between Debian and other Linux distributors is that Debian is a
	non-profit organization, and the others are commercial
	companies. Debian's aim is to work together with other Linux
	distributions rather than compete with them. We respect these
	organizations and their employees. We encourage all creators of
	Linux distributions to derive components or their entire
	distributions from Debian.
	</tt>
<p>
	<strong>
	How compatible is Debian?
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	We communicate with other Linux distribution creators in an
	effort to maintain binary compatibility across Linux
	distributions. Most commercial Linux products run as well under
	Debian as they do on the system upon which they were built. Our
	"alien" program allows you to treat packages created for these
	other systems as if they were Debian packages.
	</tt>
<p>
	<strong>
	What about Internationalization?
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	There's an active subgroup of our developers who are
	internationalizing Debian. Active development is in progress in
	French, Italian, German, and Spanish.
	</tt>
<p>
	<strong>
	How do I become a Debian Developer?
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	We're looking for people who would like to contribute work to
	Linux and be members of an international community of software
	developers that's making something that matters! You can find
	all of the developer's information in the "Debian Policy Manual"
	and "Debian Packaging Manual", which are both available in
	Debian packages.
	</tt>
<p>
	<strong>
	Can I make and sell Debian CDs?
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	If you want to distribute the Official Debian Two-CD Set, please
	contact Bruce Perens at <A HREF="mailto:bruce@debian.org">&lt;bruce@debian.org&gt;</A>.
	There is no fee for you to duplicate or sell Debian CDs. You can get free access to
	the CD "masters" via FTP, or we can express ship you
	CD-writables ready for duplication for a $50 materials and
	shipping fee.
	</tt>
<p>
	<tt>
	If you want to distribute a non-official CD, such as one to
	which you have added value, just download the files from our FTP
	site. Please only distribute the _released_ Debian versions.
	</tt>
<p>
	<strong>
	What is "Software in the Public Interest"
	</strong>
<br>
	<tt>
	It's a non-profit corporation we formed to sponsor the Debian
	effort. The purpose of the organization is to develop and
	distribute free software. Our goals are much like those of FSF
	except that our main project is a Linux system. We encourage
	programmers to use the GNU General Public License or another
	license that allows free redistribution and use of software.
	</tt>

<font size="-1" color=green>
	The trademarks "Unix", "Red Hat", "Slackware", and "RPM" are the
	property of their respective owners. Ownership of the name
	"Linux" is currently in dispute.
