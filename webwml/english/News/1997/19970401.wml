<p>
Debian was chosen to control an experiment on the Space Shuttle which
flew in March. As the mission was ended early do to a problem with the
fuel-cells, the experiment will probably fly again on a mission later this
year. The full text of the press release can be seen
<a href="shuttle1">here</a>.
