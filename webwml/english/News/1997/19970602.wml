The much awaited release of Debian GNU/Linux version 1.3 is here. 
Debian is making great strides in easing the installation of Linux. And,
of course, upgrading an existing Debian system is a snap. Two notable new
features are floppy-less install from CD and a new testing group resulting in
even fewer problems when running a Debian system.
