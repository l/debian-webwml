Following our solicitation for hosting services, two companies have
committed to donate systems and high-bandwidth net connections to the
Debian Development. Information on the donors will appear on the Debian
web site once the systems are "on the air". Several other sites offered
to donate space on an existing system, a net connection, or mail
delivery services. All of Debian's internet services are donated to the
project, including its web sites on various continents and its 75 FTP
mirror sites.
