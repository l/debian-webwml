We're happy to announce a computer manufacturer that supports Debian.
<A href="http://www.varesearch.com/">VA Research</A> is offering Debian
pre-installed at no extra charge on all of the computer systems they sell:
laptops, workstations, and file servers. You can see the products at
<A href="http://www.varesearch.com/">http://www.varesearch.com/</A>.
VA has donated a system and a high-bandwidth network connection to Debian.
Here's some information on a system on sale this month that includes a
Debian donation.

<P>We have a new system.  It's a VArStation 25 - a dual capable Pentium II
system, available with either one or two 233, 266, or 300Mhz cpus.  It's an
ide based system, and we're pricing the whole thing starting at $2200
including a Matrox card, 64 megabytes of ram, and a SoundBlaster.

<P>There are a few upgrades...bigger disk, more ram, better graphics, etc.
It's a good system because people can start with a single processor and
some ram, and add a second processor and double their ram later.

<P>In order to help Debian, we are going to donate 2% of the price of any
VArStation 25 system ordered in December with Debian pre-installed.
