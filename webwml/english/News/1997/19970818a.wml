Since the start of the Debian Official CD program, just 8 weeks ago,
over 2200 2-CD sets have been sold. The number may well be higher, as
companies are not required to tell us about their sales. About half of
the reported sales are mail-order. Approximately US$3000 in donations
have been made so far by CD purchasers, and the checks have started to
come in from the CD vendors. A list of CD vendors can be found on our
web site,
<newsurl "http://www.debian.org/">. Anyone can duplicate and sell the
Debian 1.3.1 Official 2-CD Set. For information, see
