The space shuttle mission that is being launched on July 1 will carry a
Debian GNU/Linux system. This is Debian's second space flight, a repeat
of an earlier mission that returned to earth early due to fuel-cell
problems on the shuttle. The Debian system will monitor a plant growth
experiment in the Microgravity Science Lab, will perform some simple
process control, and will send video and telemetry to the ground.
