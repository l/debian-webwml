Software in the Public Interest, Debian's parent organization, is now a
non-profit corporation under the laws of New York State. Many thanks are
due to Tim Sailer, our Treasurer, and Frank Marotta, our attorney, for
their work on incorporation.

<P>Tim and Frank will now petition the United States Internal Revenue Service
to grant us 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit status. When completed, this will
allow donations to Debian to be deductible for those who file U.S. federal
tax returns. We expect to expend $1500 to $2000 in legal fees on this
process, which is more than we currently have in our treasury. Please see
our Donations web page at
<A href="http://www.debian.org/donations">http://www.debian.org/donations</A>. If you
have questions about Debian's finances, please direct them to Tim at
<A href="mailto:tps@buoy.com">tps@buoy.com</A>.

<P>Back to the <A href="$(HOME)/">Debian GNU/Linux homepage</A>.
