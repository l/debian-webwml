The November issue of Boot Magazine includes a 240MB subset of Debian 1.3.1
on CD. Once your system is installed, you can use dselect's FTP mode to
upgrade to the full system. The issue is priced at $7.99 U.S. and $8.99
Canada. There's also a feature on alternative operating systems, including
Linux, that goes into the fundamentals of free software.
You should be able to find Boot wherever computer magazines are sold.
