<p>
The Debian group is busy building Debian 2.0, its first distribution
based on GNU LIBC 6 for all platforms, including the i386. LIBC 6
re-unites the Linux C library with the GNU C library used on other
platforms, and improves compatibility of Linux with POSIX standards.
The Debian 2.0 developmental snapshot is at
<newsurldead "http://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm">,
this is not yet a working system.
If you would like to help with this development, please read the
developer's manuals at
<newsurl "http://www.debian.org/doc/">.
</p>

<p>Debian 2.0 will continue to support the LIBC 5 applications that currently
run under Debian 1.3 and other Linux distributions.
