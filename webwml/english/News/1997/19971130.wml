<define-tag pagetitle>Debian Announces $1000 Grant to Gnome Project</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::news

The Debian GNU/Linux Distribution is getting enough donations now that we
can support the development of free software. We use most donations for our
own work, but some outside projects are worth funding.

<P>Debian is awarding $1000 to the GNOME project (see
<A href="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</A>). They
are building a GUI desktop for Linux and Unix systems. In addition, we
have granted GNOME use of Debian's servers so that they need not spend
any of the $1000 on internet services. We chose the GNOME project
because:

<OL>
<LI>They are using 100% free software.
<LI>They have an excellent design and have shown rapid progress.
<LI>They are doing the right thing, and that should be rewarded.
</OL>

<P>This won't be the last Debian grant. To qualify for support, all of the
software used by a project must conform to
<A href="../../social_contract#guidelines">Debian's
Free Software Guidelines</A>.
These assure that the software is free for use by <em>anyone</em>, not just Debian.
