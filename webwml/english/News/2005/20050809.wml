<p>The Debian Project has lost another member of its community.  Jens
Schmalzing (jensen) died on July 30th in a tragic accident at his
workplace in Munich.</p>

<p>Jens was involved in Debian as a maintainer of several packages, as
supporter of the PowerPC port, as a member of the kernel team, and was
instrumental in taking the PowerPC kernel package to version 2.6.  He
also maintained the Mac-on-Linux emulator and its kernel modules,
helped with the installer and with local Munich activities.  The
kernel team dedicates the 2.6.12-2 release to him.</p>

<p>The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software.  The contribution of Jens will not be
forgotten, and other developers will continue his work.</p>

<p>Jens will be missed. He left behind a wife and three children, who
have our sympathy.</p>
