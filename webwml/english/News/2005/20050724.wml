<h3>Sixth Debian Developers' Conference ends in Success</h3>

<p>More than 300 people attended this year's Debian Conference, which
took place from July 9th to 17th at the Helsinki University of
Technology in Espoo,
Finland.  The conference has been supported by more than 20 sponsors
and featured a lot of talks, workshops, demonstrations, coding
marathons and round table discussions on various aspects of the Debian
project.</p>

<p>Highlights include a presentation about the large-scale deployment
of 80,000 Debian workstations in Extramadura, Spain, along with
several talks about popular Debian derivatives such as Skolelinux and
Ubuntu.  The presentations were captured by the Video Team and are
available online at <http://dc5video.debian.net/>.</p>

<p>The conference broke several records, making it the largest Debian
conference ever.  The number of sponsors and the value of their
commitment exceeded that of previous Debian conferences.  This year,
more than 20 sponsors provided the Debian Conference with a total
budget of around 125,000 Euros.  This generosity made it possible to,
among other things, provide housing and food for almost 200
participants.</p>

<p>The conference was an organisational challenge that required a large
team of organisers and volunteers, who were working around the clock
to coordinate the event.  The Debian Project Leader, Branden Robinson,
was impressed with the performance:</p>

<blockquote>
    "The diligence and professionalism of our conference organisers
    continues to impress.  The Debian Conference occupies an
    increasingly important role for us, and if the attendees are the
    lifeblood of its success, then the organisers are its heart,
    getting everyone where they need to be."
</blockquote>
