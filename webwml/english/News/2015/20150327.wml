<p>
In October of 2014, Imagination Technologies donated several
MIPS-based machines for Debian development; these include
substantially faster Loongson 3A (mipsel) and Cavium Octeon II (mips)
servers. The brand new machines include three Loongson LS3A-RS780E
development boards, one Lemote 3A ITX and three EdgeRouter Pro 8 port
machines.

<p>
<q>Debian's distributed build cluster requires high performance and high
reliability from the machines used</q>, explains Aurelien Jarno, Debian
MIPS port maintainer. <q>We are confident that these devices will help us
build and maintain Debian's MIPS ports over the next release cycles</q>.
</p>

<p>
The Debian MIPS ports are also possible thanks to donations from the
AQL hosting service provider, the Eaton remote controlled ePDU and
many other individual members of the Debian community.
