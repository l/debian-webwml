<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce a new security.debian.org mirror with 
hardware and hosting provided by SAKURA Internet, Inc. The new host is located 
in and serves content from Japan.
</p>

<p>
The hardware and hosting donation will allow the Debian Systems Administration 
(DSA) team to improve Debian's core services by providing a security mirror 
archive for Asia and is another step towards decentralized and stable security 
mirror access for world.
</p>

<p>
<q>In combination with the GeoDNS feature used by Debian, the new mirror should 
speed up downloads for our users in that geographical area drastically. This is 
a welcome improvement in the worldwide coverage of dedicated official 
security.debian.org mirrors, administrated by the Debian project</q> said 
Martin Zobel-Helas, a member of the Debian System Administrator team.
