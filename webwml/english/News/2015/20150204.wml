<p>The Debian Project sadly announces that it has lost a member of its
community. Clytie Siddall passed recently after a long battle with
Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome.</p>

<p>Clytie was a contributor of Vietnamese translations to Debian and
other projects for many years. Within Debian she worked on translations
for the installer, dpkg, apt and various documentation. She also contributed
translations within the GNOME community and many other projects. Clytie
was also a GNOME foundation member between 2005 and 2007.</p>

<p>The Debian Project honours her good work and strong dedication to Debian
and Free Software. Clytie's contributions will not be forgotten, and the
high standards of her work will continue to serve as an inspiration to
others.</p>
