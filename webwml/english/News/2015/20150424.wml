Almost a year after the birth of the 
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS">Debian Long Term Support (LTS) project</a>,
Squeeze LTS can be considered a success. Thanks go to the many volunteers and
sponsors! Debian 6 "Squeeze" has seen more than 200 security uploads since the
start of its extended support period. The most widely used packages have been
fixed in a timely fashion and many organizations can thus safely rely on the
continued maintenance of Squeeze LTS.
</p>
<p>
Given this experience, we are confident that Debian 7 "Wheezy" and Debian 8
"Jessie" will benefit from Long Term Support.
</p>
<p>
However, some restrictions in coverage had to be made for Squeeze LTS. For
example, only x86 PCs (amd64 and i386) are supported, and a 
<a href="https://anonscm.debian.org/cgit/collab-maint/debian-security-support.git/plain/security-support-ended.deb6">
number of popular packages</a> are unsupported. For example, you cannot run a
Xen dom0 or a KVM host with Squeeze, and there isn't support for graphical
browsers. The current team resources are only enough to keep up with the
observed workload, and would not be sufficient to extend this further.
</p>
<p>
Thus, if you want Wheezy LTS to have a better coverage for such use cases and
for less popular packages, please consider helping the Debian LTS team, either
with <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development">developer time</a>
or with <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Funding">funding</a>.
</p>
<p>
This summer, during <a href="http://debconf15.debconf.org/">DebConf 15</a> in
Heidelberg, the Debian LTS team and the Debian security team will re-assess the
level of support for the project and will make plans for Wheezy LTS (Jessie LTS
still has a few years ahead of it).  Now is the time to show your support!
