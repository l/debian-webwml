<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the sixth update of its
stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename <codename>).  This update
mainly adds corrections for security problems to the stable release,
along with a few adjustment to serious problems.</p>

<p>Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 4.0 but only updates some of the packages included.  There is
no need to throw away 4.0 CDs or DVDs but only to update via an up-to-date
Debian mirror after an installation, to cause any out of date packages to
be updated.</p>

<p>Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.</p>

<p>New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.</p>

<p>Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:</p>
