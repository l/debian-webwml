<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the fourth update of its stable
distribution Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (codename <codename>).  In addition to
correcting several security problems and a few serious defects in the stable
release, for the first time in Debian's history an update for a stable
distrubtion also adds support for newer hardware by giving users the option to
install newer drivers.</p>

<p>Existing Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 installation CDs and DVDs can continue to be
used to install this update. After installation, upgrading via an up-to-date
Debian mirror will cause any out of date packages to be updated. However, users
of the network-console installation method are strongly encouraged to update
their media, see the "Debian Installer" portion of this announcement for
more information.</p>

<p>Those who install updates frequently from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.</p> 

<p>New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.</p> 

<p>Upgrading to this revision online should be done by directing the
aptitude (or apt) package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) at
one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of
mirrors is available at:</p>

<h2>About <q>etch-and-a-half</q></h2>

<p><q>Etch and a half</q> is Debian's desire to support hardware that requires
updated drivers. This marks the first time the Debian project updates
several core packages in its stable distribution without security
implications and demonstrates its huge dedication for their users.</p>

<p>Components newer than the first release of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 (<q>etch</q>)
that were not supported yet will be detected by an updated installation
routine which is able to install a newer Linux kernel (2.6.24) on the
freshly installed system. This revision includes packages that are based
upon the Linux 2.6.24 kernel as well. Installation of these additional
packages is not required and will not occur by default.  The existing
2.6.18-based kernel will continue to be the default kernel for the etch
release.</p>

<p>A more recent version of X.org, the X window system, also contains new
drivers that add support to e.g. Geforce 8 series GPUs, intel 965GM,
965GME, G33, Q35, Q33 cards.  Dual-head setups are also supported
rudimentary.</p>

<p>These packages have been updated or newly introduced through <q>etch-and-a-half</q>:</p>

covering the special features of <q>etch-and-a-half</q> have been written as well as
a <a href="$(HOME)/releases/etch/debian-installer/etchnhalf">short
update for the installation instructions</a>.</p>


<h2>Debian-Installer Update</h2>

<p>The Debian-Installer was updated to repair an issue with the network-console
installation option. Due to a lack of entropy in how the host key is generated,
earlier Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 installers are vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle
attack. Two other issues regarding installation on already existing RAID
setups and recognizing PowerPC64 system have been fixed as well.</p>


<h2>Miscellaneous Bugfixes</h2>

<p>This stable update adds several binary updates for various architectures
to packages whose version was not synchronised across all architectures.
It also adds a few important corrections to the following packages:</p>
