<p>Mar del Plata, Argentina, 8 August 2008 - The Debian Project, the
team behind the free Debian GNU/Linux operating system, is inviting
members of the public and the press to its annual conference,
DebConf 8, which takes place from 10 August to 16 August at the
Hotel Dorá in Mar del Plata, Argentina.</p>

<p>Over 100 events have been scheduled with speakers from all parts of
the world, such as Debian Project leader Steve McIntyre and Hewlett
Packard's Open Source &amp; Linux Chief Technologist, Bdale Garbee. The
topics include global team organisation, internationalisation,
development internals and policy, virtualisation, and systems
&amp; network administration. In tutorial sessions, attendants can gain
hands-on experience in various subjects. Development and
brainstorming takes place in the two "hack labs", and peripheral
events, such as a world cheese party, allow for extensive
networking.</p>

<p>The full schedule is available on the conference website:
<a href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc8_schedule/">http://penta.debconf.org/dc8_schedule/</a>.</p>

<p>Celebrations will be in order on Saturday, 16 August, when the
Debian Project turns 15 years of age. Founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock
to be a truly Free, community project, the project has grown to one
of the largest and most influential open source projects.</p>

<p>Jörg Jaspert, one of the conference organisers, is excited: <q>Of all
the Debian conferences I have experienced, this is the best prepared.
Thank you to the local team for all their work!</q> The local organiser
team &ndash; 40 volunteers from all over the country &ndash; have
dedicated almost an entire year of their time to make this event
happen.</p>

<p>Attending the conference is free of charge, although visitors are
required to register on-site. More information is available from the
conference website: <a
href="http://debconf8.debconf.org">http://debconf8.debconf.org</a>.</p>

<p>The language of presentation is English, although many Spanish
speakers are available to help and answer questions.</p>

<p>All events are recorded and streamed over the Internet. More
information is available at: <a

<p>On Wednesday, 13 August, no events will take place as conference
attendees take a day off to experience local sites and culture.</p>

<p>Following DebConf 8, Debian Day will take place on 18 August in
Buenos Aires. Debian Day is a free-of-charge, one-day software
users' conference. The event provides a friendly, personal
atmosphere for individuals who are interested in free and
open-source software to meet the people behind the project and
obtain free advice.</p>
