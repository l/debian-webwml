<p>The Debian project is proud to announce that it has again been accepted by
Google as a mentor organisation for the Summer of Code programme. We have been
allocated twelve tasks for this year. Google will fund the students mentioned
here to work full time on those tasks during their summer vacation, from May
26th to August 18th. They will be guided and evaluated during this time by a
team of Debian developers.</p>

<p>Several tasks cover communication between software authors, users and Debian
developers. A number of tasks target quality assurance and improved testing,
while others will result in new tools that help maintain Debian systems.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jonathan Roes will work on Netconf, a next generation approach for
  network configuration management on Linux systems. This will provide a single
  logical replacement for a large number of programs currently handling related
  tasks on Debian systems.</li>
  <li>CRAN is a comprehensive archive of tools and libraries for the GNU R
  statistical computing language. Charles Blundell will write cran2deb, a tool
  to help with automatic generation of Debian packages from CRAN packages and
  bundles. This makes it much easier for developers and users to work with R
  extensions on Debian systems, especially for administrators of larger
  computing facilities.</li>
  <li>Nico Golde will improve Debian's quality assurance processes for security
  updates by providing a security update beta test facility. This will allow
  Debian to test security updates on a broader range of setups prior to public
  release and in addition to the existing QA measures.</li>
  <li>Jigdo is a tool developed to help reduce the cost of downloading and
  mirroring Debian CD and DVD images. Dustin Rayner's project jigdo-ivory
  entails the creation of a browser-based Jigdo client to make downloads much
  easier for end users.</li>
  <li>Obey Arthur Liu is planning to create a GTK+ GUI for the package
  management tool Aptitude that will work alongside improved ncurses and
  command-line interfaces. This will offer a new interface design geared toward
  usability and advanced functionality.</li>
  <li>Jonny Lamb will work on debexpo, a web-based Debian package repository to
  allow everyone to upload and provide personal package repositories. It
  includes functionality for sponsors to easily review packages and should ease
  contribution to Debian by offering an easy way to contribute packages for
  software not yet included in Debian.</li>
  <li>Christian von Essen will be developing the <q>Ultimate Debian
  Database</q>, a large relational database that will collect together the
  project's important information into one central easy-to-use system including
  bugs, build information, developer information, etc.</li>
  <li>Adam Jensen will create debgraph, an infrastructure to process package
  inter-dependencies and similar data using a generic graph interface. Many
  applications such as package managers already use some of this functionality,
  but this project will be the first common code to support more complex
  queries, allowing developers of other tools to concentrate on higher-level
  issues.</li>
  <li>Per Andersson plans to work on improving Debians support for consumer
  market NAS (Network Attached Storage) devices. These popular devices are tiny
  files servers, often equipped with ARM processors and running an embedded
  Linux. This project will make it easier to install and customize Debian on
  these devices and further increase Debians popularity in the embedded Linux
  market.</li>
  <li>Lintian is an automated package checking tool used for quality assurance,
  able to detect all kinds of common errors and mistakes in Debian packages.
  Jord&agrave; Polo Bard&eacute;s will enhance the diagnosis functionality in lintian,
  especially with respect to handling the severity and accuracy of such tests,
  to make it more usable in automated setups where low-importance test and
  false positives may cause issues.</li>
  <li>Max Wiehle is going to add support for automatically merging
  configuration files on system upgrades. At the moment, Debian's package
  management tools currently just keep track of old and new configurations as
  upgrades take place, so this new work will make life much easier for system
  administrators.</li>
  <li>Juan Luis Belmonte Mendez will be writing a new tool to help configure
  PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) and NSS (Name Service Switch) through
  the Debian Installer. This should allow for much easier configuration of
  Debian machines to use common network based authentication systems like LDAP
  and Active Directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>We welcome them to our vibrant developer community and encourage all of our
teams and contributors to support and help them to succeed with their tasks.</p>
