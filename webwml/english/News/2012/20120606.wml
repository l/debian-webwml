<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce the availability of
its <a href="$(HOME)/intro/diversity">diversity statement</a>,
approved by a <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2012/vote_002">large
majority of the project members</a>.
</p>

<p>
The <strong>technical</strong> side of the Debian Project is already
committed to diversity: we don't accept discrimination against persons,
groups or fields of endeavor in our software
(<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines, points 5 and 6</a>).
Now, the <strong>community</strong> part of the Debian Project explicitly
welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
</p>

<p>
<q>The constructive and fruitful discussion that led to the current
version of this statement was really encouraging</q>, said Francesca
Ciceri, who proposed the initial draft and took a lot of other opinions into account.
<q>I'd like to thank all the people who participated in the drafting process
proposing changes and fixes, explaining different points of view and
approving this initiative</q>, Francesca added.
</p>

<p>
<q>This statement marks a new stage in the process of welcoming
contributors to our project</q>, said Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader.
<q>Community diversity goes hand in hand with community richness.</q>
</p>


<h2>About Debian</h2>
