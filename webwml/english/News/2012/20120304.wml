<p>The Debian Project's annual conference is slowly coming closer.
Visiting places around the world since 2000, DebConf will take place
this year in Managua, Nicaragua, in July and will again provide an
opportunity for people who contribute to Debian to meet in person for
face-to-face collaboration and discussions. </p>

<p>At DebConf we try to bring together as many Debian contributors as
possible, including those who could not afford to attend from their
own resources.  You can help make DebConf12 a success by your
organisation becoming a sponsor, or by donating money as an
individual.</p>

<p><a href="http://debconf12.debconf.org/payments.xhtml">Individual
donations</a> can be made online in either US dollars or euros.</p>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a sponsor, you can find more
information about DebConf12 <a
href="http://debconf12.debconf.org/become-sponsor.xhtml">sponsor
page</a> or directly contact &lt;<a
href="mailto:sponsors@debconf.org">sponsors@debconf.org</a>&gt;.</p>

<p>In addition to monetary donations, sponsorship can be provided in
the form of in-kind donations, or by lending equipment for the
conference period.</p>


<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>
The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Thousands of
volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Available in 70 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.
