<p>The Debian Project announces the availability of its
<a href="$(HOME)/legal/patent">patent policy</a> for the Debian archive.</p>

<p>The Debian Project maintains a critical stance towards software patents: we
consider software patents to be a threat to Free Software and an obstacle to
the Debian mission of providing an entirely Free operating system for
everyone's use. We believe software patents provide no advantage in promoting
software innovation and we encourage our upstream authors to object to software
patents.</p>

<p>At the same time, given the <em>de facto</em> possibility of patenting
software-related ideas in several countries around the world, it is important
to neither underestimate nor overestimate software patent issues. We are
particularly concerned about patent <acronym title="fear, uncertainty, and
doubt">FUD</acronym> and we have worked to improve clarity on the subject.</p>

<p>After the publication of the <a href="$(HOME)/reports/patent-faq">Community
Distribution Patent Policy FAQ</a>, the availability of a patent policy for the
Debian archive is our next step in coping with the software patent system that
we hope to see abolished. We thank lawyers at the
<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">Software Freedom Law Center</a> for
working with us on this policy.</p>

<p><q>Patent Aggression is widespread throughout the information technology
industry at present</q>, said Eben Moglen, founding director of the Software
Freedom Law Center. <q>Parties have spent billions of dollars trying to use
patent monopolies to halt innovation and threaten innovators. With the adoption
of this patent policy Debian prepares to defend its developers and users more
effectively, forcefully, and knowledgeably.</q></p>

<p>Debian Project Leader Stefano Zacchiroli said <q>The Debian Project has a
long tradition of standing up for users' rights to an entirely Free operating
system. Patent fears, uncertainties and doubts undermine this. A patent policy
and a contact point for related issues in the Debian archive will help reducing
patent FUD among our users.</q></p>


<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>
The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Thousands of
volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Available in 70 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.
