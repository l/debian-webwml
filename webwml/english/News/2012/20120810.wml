<p>  
The Debian Installer team announced the first beta release of the
installer for Debian 7.0 <q>Wheezy</q>.  This new release includes
various improvements in different areas, like booting, Linux kernel, APT,
low memory installs, and networking. It also uses the new official theme
<q>Joy</q>. The installer supports 73, of which 56 are fully translated.
All the changes are listed in the Debian Installer team's 
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/News/2012/20120804">announcement</a>
to the Debian community.
</p>
<p>
The team asked Debian users to help in testing and improving this new
version of the installer: while there are some 
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">known
issues</a> with the installer that do not need to be reported, it is very
important to try the installer in order to find all possible bugs before
the release.
</p>
<p>
Problems should be reported as an 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">installation
report</a>.
<br />
More experienced user can help by triaging bugs for virtual
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/upgrade-reports">upgrade-reports</a> and
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/installation-reports">installation-reports</a>
packages or by propose texts for problems, which should be documented in the 
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/release-notes">release-notes</a>.

one of the 12 architecture supported, are
available at the
