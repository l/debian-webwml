<p>
On August 16, the Debian community will celebrate its 19th birthday
since Ian Murdock's original 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux.development/msg/a32d4e2ef3bcdcc6">founding
announcement</a>. 
As is tradition, the Debian communities all around the world will gather
to celebrate it with Debian Birthday parties.
</p>

<p>
A Debian Birthday party is a fun event, globally marking the appreciation 
and the joy of being part of our community and could consist of
workshops, talks, or bug squashing parties both virtual and in real life.
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDay/2012">Check if there is one in your area</a>, 
and if not, it's not too late to organize one and mark the event in the wiki!
</p>

<p>
Organizing Debian Birthday parties is quite simple: remember that the
goal is to hang out with other Debian enthusiasts and have fun.
You might decide, for example, to have a
<a href="https://www.debian.org/events/keysigning">keysigning party</a>, an <a
href="http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Installfest-HOWTO/introduction.html">installfest</a>,
a <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/HostingBSP">bug squashing party</a>, or simply
bring a <a href="http://happybirthday.dug.net.pl/">Debian cake</a> and some drinks!
