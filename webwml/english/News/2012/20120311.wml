## first of all the news!
<p>
The Debian Edu Team is pleased to announce the release of Debian Edu
<q>Squeeze</q> 6.0.4+r0!
## then a couple of info on what we are talking about
<br />
Debian Edu (aka <q>Skolelinux</q>) is a Debian Pure Blend specifically
targeted at schools and educational institutions, and provides a
completely configured school network environment out of the box.
It covers PXE installation, PXE booting for diskless machines, and
setup for a school server, for stationary workstations, and for
workstations that can be taken away from the school network.
Several educational applications like Celestia, Dr. Geo, GCompris,
GeoGebra, Kalzium, KGeography and Solfege are included in
the default desktop setup.
</p>

## what is new in this release? just the most important things, for the
## rest let's link release notes!
<p>
Besides including everything provided by the fourth update
of Debian <q>Squeeze</q> (6.0.4), this new release of Debian
Edu introduces some interesting improvements, including:
replacement of LWAT with GOsa² as the LDAP administration interface;
updated artwork and new Debian Edu / Skolelinux logo; a new LXDE desktop option,
in addition to KDE (default) and GNOME (LXDE and GNOME are available only
with the CD installation method); faster LTSP client boot; 
improved handing of removable media on thin clients; a new roaming workstation
profile for laptops; full Samba NT4 domain support for Windows XP/Vista/7; etc.
<br />
The Debian Edu Team has also worked intensively on the documentation, 
improving and extending the manual which is now fully translated to
German, French and Italian, while partial translations exist for
Danish, Norwegian Bokmål and Spanish.
The installation process has also been improved, integrating the new
version of debian-installer, allowing copying of ISO
images to USB sticks and changing partitioning for Standalone installs
to have a separate /home and no /usr.

# Add a nice quote
<p>
When asked about the 
<a href="http://people.skolelinux.org/pere/blog/Debian_Edu_interview__Nigel_Barker.html">advantages
of Skolelinux/Debian Edu</a>, Nigel Barker replied: 
<q>For me the integrated setup.
This is not just the server, or the workstation, or the LTSP.
It's all of them, and it's all configured ready to go.
I read somewhere in the early documentation that it is designed to
be set up and managed by the Maths or Science teacher, who doesn't
necessarily know much about computers, in a small Norwegian school.
That describes me perfectly if you replace Norway with Japan.</q>

## yeah, ok, this is all very interesting, but *how* can I get it? i.e.:
## instructions for downloading, installing, upgrading, ecc
<p>
For those who want to give Debian Edu <q>Squeeze</q> a try, 
<a href="http://maintainer.skolelinux.org/debian-edu-doc/en/debian-edu-squeeze-manual.html#Installation">complete
download and installation instructions</a> are available, including
detailed instructions in the <a href="http://maintainer.skolelinux.org/debian-edu-doc/en/debian-edu-squeeze-manual.html#GettingStarted"><q>Getting
Started</q> chapter of the manual</a> explaining the first steps, such as setting
up a network or adding users.
<br />
Those who are already using rc1-3 can upgrade to this version by using for
example <q>apt-get upgrade</q> - users upgrading from beta3 must make 
sure they keep the existing gosa.conf file when dpkg asks how to handle 
the changed file during upgrade.

computers in your school using only a
couple of hours every week? Check out Debian Edu Squeeze!

## then is time for some statistics/data 
Skolelinux is used by at least two hundred schools all over the world,
mostly in Germany (in 2009 the region of Rhineland-Palatinate decided to
use it in all its schools) and Norway.
