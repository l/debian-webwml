<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce that in the next few weeks Bug
Squashing Parties (<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/BSP"><q>BSPs</q></a>)
will take place in several countries.
The main focus of a Bug Squashing Party is to triage and fix bugs, but it
is also an opportunity for users less familiar with the BTS to make other
contributions to the Debian project, such as translating package
descriptions or improving the wiki. Debian developers will be present to
help contributors understand how the project works and to help get fixes
into Debian.
</p>
<p>
Below is a list of upcoming Bug Squashing Parties; don't forget to regularly
check our <a href="$(HOME)/events">events</a> page to find
