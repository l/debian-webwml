<p>
An important part of any operating system is its look and feel. Debian is
no exception. If you've ever wanted to influence the look and feel of an
operating system, now is your chance.
The Debian Project is calling for contributors to design graphics
for the next release of the Universal Operating System, called
<q>Wheezy</q>.
</p>
<p>
If you would like to get involved, visit the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianDesktop/Artwork/Wheezy">wiki page to get
started</a>.
You'll see what the requirements are for submitting artwork, as well as a
form to submit your own work to Debian. You can send questions to the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-desktop">debian-desktop mailing list</a>
if you have any.
</p>
<p>
Thanks very much and everyone looks forward to seeing your work!
