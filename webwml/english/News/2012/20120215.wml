<p>
The Debian Project is pleased to announce that in the next few months
Bug Squashing Parties (<q><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP">BSP</a></q>s)
will take place in several countries.
The main focus of a Bug Squashing Party is to triage and fix bugs, 
but it is also an opportunity for users less familiar with the BTS
to make other contributions to the Debian project, such as
translating package descriptions or improving the wiki.
Debian developers will be present to help contributors
understand how the project works and to help get fixes into
Debian.
</p>
<p>
During the coming weekend, 17-19 February, a BSP will be held at the
<a href="http://www.irill.org/">IRILL offices</a> in Paris, France.
This event will also be an opportunity for
potential contributors to meet Debian Developers or Maintainers. Numerous
regular contributors will attend this BSP and can help newcomers to
fix their first bugs.
For organizational reasons, registering on the
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2012/02/fr/Paris">Debian wiki</a> is
mandatory.
</p>
<p>
On 2-4 March, a BSP will be held in Cambridge, UK: people
interested in attending it are invited to add their names to its
<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/BSP/2012/03/gb/Cambridge">wiki page</a>.

During the same weekend, 2-4 March, a BSP will also be held at 
<a href="http://www.credativ.de/">credativ offices</a> in Mönchengladbach, 
Germany: more information is available on the

The following weekend another BSP will take place, on 10-11 March:
<a href="http://www.plug.org.au/">Perth Linux Users Group</a> is
organizing a Debian Bug Squashing Party at the
<a href="http://www.ucc.asn.au/">University Computer Club</a> in Perth,
Western Australia. For more information, visit its

Over 11-13 May, another Debian BSP will be held in the UK, at York.
