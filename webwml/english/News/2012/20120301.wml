<p>On February 20, 2012, the DebConf committee decided that DebConf13, the Debian
developer conference of 2013, should take place on the shores of the
Lake Neuch√¢tel in Switzerland, most likely in the middle of August.
More details may be found on the
<a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf13/Switzerland/Bid">organizers' wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In a two hour meeting on Monday evening, the Swiss bid
narrowly won over the bid from Riga, Latvia. Teams had been
preparing their bids since mid-2011, seeking venues and local sponsors in
their respective cities and countries. </p>

<p>The two bids both had character and unique identities. On the one hand, the
Riga proposal was totally centered on city and university life. On the
other hand, the Swiss bid aimed to bring DebConf to a setting that is
known for its natural beauty.</p>

<p><q>Our proposal strongly focuses on the community
gathering aspect of DebConf. Accomodation, hacking spaces and talk rooms
will be at the same place with a beautiful view over the Lake
Neuchatel and to Swiss alps. We'll have the whole holiday camp
exclusively for DebConf</q>, said Gaudenz Steinlin, member of the Swiss
team.</p>

<p>The DebConf organizers congratulate the future organizers of DebConf13,
and thank both teams for their efforts.</p>

<p>The venue decision for DebConf14 will be made in approximately twelve
months. Proposals should be submitted by 31 December 2012 to be eligible for
consideration.</p>
