<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the seventh update of its
old stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (codename `sarge').  This
is the first time we update the old stable distribution during the
lifetime of the stable distribution.  This update mainly adds
corrections for security problems to the oldstable release, along with
a few adjustments to serious problems.</p>

<p>Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of Debian
GNU/Linux 3.1 but only updates some of the packages included.  There is
no need to throw away 3.1 CDs or DVDs but only to update against
ftp.debian.org after an installation, in order to incorporate those late
changes.</p>

<p>Those who frequently install updates from security.debian.org won't have
to update many packages and most updates from security.debian.org are
included in this update.</p>

<p>New CD and DVD images containing updated packages and the regular
installation media accompanied with the package archive respectively
will be available soon at the regular locations.</p>

<p>Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
`aptitude' (or `apt') package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual
page) to one of Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive
list of mirrors is available at:</p>

<h2>Debian-Installer Update</h2>

<p>With this release the installation system for sarge gains full support for
installing `oldstable' from network mirrors.  This includes base-config.</p>

<p>The installer also uses and supports the updated kernels included in this
revision.  This causes old netboot and floppy images to stop working,
updated versions are available from the regular locations.</p>

<p>Other changes are a final fix to prevent leakage of sensitive data through
saved log files and a minor fix in the partman-jfs component.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous Bugfixes</h2>

<p>This update adds several binary-only updates for various architectures
to packages whose version was not synchronised across all architectures.
It also adds a few important corrections to the following packages:</p>
