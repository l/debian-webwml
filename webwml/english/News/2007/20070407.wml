<p>The Debian project has updated the stable distribution Debian GNU/Linux
3.1 (codename <q>sarge</q>).  This update mainly adds security updates to the
stable release, along with a few corrections to serious problems.  Those
who frequently update from security.debian.org won't have to update many
packages and most updates from security.debian.org are included in this
update.</p>

<p>In preparation for the upcoming release of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0
(codename <q>etch</q>), Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 will be moved to the <q>oldstable</q>
part of the archive.  Users who would like to continue using Debian
GNU/Linux 3.1 are advised to update their <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> network
source to refer to <q>sarge</q> instead of <q>stable</q>.</p>

<p>Please note that this update does not constitute a new version of
Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 but only updates some of the packages included in
the stable release.  There is no need to throw away 3.1 CDs or DVDs
but only to update against ftp.debian.org after an installation, in
order to incorporate those late changes. New CD and DVD images will be delayed until
after the release of <q>etch</q> and will be available at the regular
locations.
</p>

<p>Upgrading to this revision online is usually done by pointing the
<q>apt</q> package tool (see the sources.list(5) manual page) to one of
Debian's many FTP or HTTP mirrors.  A comprehensive list of mirrors is
available at:</p>
