<p>The old stable release Debian GNU/Linux (codename 'woody') has been
archived.  The official source for this distribution is the dedicated
archive host called <a
href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/dists/woody/">\
archive.debian.org</a>.  It is no longer available on
regular Debian mirror servers.</p>

<p>After four and a half years this marks the final end of life for
Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.  This distribution has been superseded by Debian
GNU/Linux 3.1 (codename 'sarge') which the Debian project has released
on June 6th, 2005.  Security support for woody has therefore ended
already in June 2006, one year after the release of sarge.</p>

<p>The Debian security team is able to support up to two distributions at
the same time for about one year.  This way users are given a one year
period to upgrade their systems to the current stable distribution.
After this period security support for the old stable distribution is
discontinued and the distribution itself is archived on the dedicated
archive host.</p>
