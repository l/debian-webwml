This directory contains press announcements and Debian Project News
(formerly known as Debian Weekly News).
Coordination of press announcements is done by the Debian Press Team
at press@debian.org, Debian Project News are maintained by the Debian
Publicity Team at debian-publicity@lists.debian.org

Press releases are only added *after* they have been posted by the
Press Team.

DO NOT ADD FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS SUBDIRECTORIES!

Except you are a Debian webmaster or maintaining press releases.
These people know what to do, others will break things.

If you want an announcement to be posted, please contact the Press
Team instead.

If you want to have an item added to DWN, please contact the DWN Team
instead.


You are, however, invited to fix spelling errors or bad code in
existing files.
