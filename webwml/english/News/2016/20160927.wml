<p>The Debian Project recently learned that it has lost a member of its
community. Kristoffer H. Rose died on September 17th after a long battle with
myelo fibrosis.</p>

<p>
Kristoffer was a Debian contributor from the very early days of the project,
and the upstream author of several packages that are still in the Debian
archive nowadays, such as the LaTeX package Xy-pic and FlexML. On his return
to the project after several years' absence, many of us had the pleasure of
meeting Kristoffer during DebConf15 in Heidelberg.
</p>

<p>The Debian Project honours his good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software.  Kristoffer's broad technical knowledge and his
ability to share that knowledge with others will be missed.  The
contributions of Kristoffer will not be forgotten, and the high standards
of his work will continue to serve as an inspiration to others.</p>
