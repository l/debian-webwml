<p>
Do you have to administrate a computer lab or a whole school network?
Would you like to install servers, workstations and laptops which
will then work together?
Do you want the stability of Debian with network services already
preconfigured?
Do you wish to have a web-based tool to manage systems and several
hundred or even more user accounts?
Have you asked yourself if and how older computers could be used?
</p>

<p>
Then Debian Edu is for you. The teachers themselves or their technical support
can roll out a complete multi-user multi-machine study environment within
a few days. Debian Edu comes with hundreds of applications pre-installed,
but you can always add more packages from Debian.
</p>

<p>
The Debian Edu developer team is happy to announce Debian Edu 8+edu0
<q>Jessie</q>, the latest Debian Edu / Skolelinux release, entirely based on
Debian 8 <q>Jessie</q>, update 8.5.
Upgrades from previous beta releases of Debian Edu Jessie to this release
are possible and encouraged!

<h2>About Debian Edu and Skolelinux</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Debian Edu, also known as
Skolelinux</a>, is a Linux distribution based on Debian providing an
out-of-the box environment of a completely configured school network.
Immediately after installation a school server running all services
needed for a school network is set up just waiting for users and
machines to be added via GOsa², a comfortable web interface.
A netbooting environment is prepared, so after initial
installation of the main server from CD or USB stick all other
machines can be installed via the network.
Older computers (even up to ten or so years old) can be used as LTSP
thin clients or diskless workstations, booting from the network without
any installation at all.
The Debian Edu school server provides an LDAP database and Kerberos
authentication service, centralized home directories, a DHCP server, a web
proxy and many other services. The desktop contains more than 60 educational
software packages and more are available from the Debian archive.
Schools can choose between the desktop environments KDE Plasma, GNOME, LXDE,
MATE and Xfce.

Some recent feedback:
</p>

<p>
Giorgio Pioda, system administrator, who is using Debian Edu at SPSE
(<a href="http://www.spse.ch/">Scuola per Sportivi d’Élite</a>) in
Tenero, Switzerland (Cantone Ticino, Italian speaking part), says:
<q>We are using Debian Edu Jessie already since July 2015 and very
much enjoy its stability since day one.</q>
</p>

<p>
Matthias Hierweck, Studienrat (senior teacher), at
<q>Mildred-Scheel-Berufskolleg</q> in Solingen, Germany reports:
<q>Since September 2015 a Debian Edu Jessie combi server is running in a
computerroom newly set up by me. 34, to some extent older computers and laptops
are used as diskless workstations; these are working just fine with LXDE.</q>
</p>

<p>
Uwe Blahowsky, principal at <q>Schule im Pfeifferhof</q> in Graz, Austria,
wrote: <q>Since 2011 the school's computer system is managed using
Skolelinux. In February 2016 we (Mario Fetka and me) switched to
Debian Edu Jessie. The system consisting of a main server, 10 Linux
workstations for both teachers and pupils, and 2 Windows7 computers for
the school administration, is running very stable. The pupils and teachers
are getting on very well with it; they are mainly using the Chromium browser
to do web research and Libre Office for word processing. The Libre Office
update is clearly noticeable in the daily work. Another great relief for me
as administrator is the GOsa² web interface to manage users and systems.</q>
