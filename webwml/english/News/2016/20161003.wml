<p>
  Over the last several months,
  <a href="http://www.hpe.com/engage/opensource">
    Hewlett Packard Enterprise
  </a>
  (HPE), one of Debian's primary hardware partners, has made several
  large in-kind donations in support of Debian core services.  The 
  donated equipment will be deployed in the data centers of multiple 
  hosting partners in Canada, the United States, and Australia.
</p>
<p>
  HPE's in-kind donations will allow Debian:
  <ul>
    <li>
      to significantly enhance core service
      availability by deploying four HPE ProLiant BL460c
      Gen9 Server Blades (in enclosure) and an HPE MSA
      2040-based SAN at the University of British
      Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver.
    </li>
    <li>
      to refresh the primary archive infrastructure
      (ftp-master.debian.org) by replacing the
      machines hosted by Brown University with an
      HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen9 Server.
    </li>
    <li>
      to refresh the security mirror infrastructure
      (security.debian.org) by replacing the
      machines hosted by ANU, ISC and UMN with
      HPE ProLiant DL360 Gen9 Servers.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  <q>Hewlett Packard Enterprise relies on Debian's technologies
  for HPE Linux, a technology standard across the company,</q>
  said Steve Geary, Senior Director at Hewlett Packard
  Enterprise. <q>We're grateful the Debian project can use
  our hardware donation to further improve the reliability
  of its infrastructure.</q>
</p>
<p>
  <q>HPE's generous donation of equipment will allow Debian
  to refresh the servers that underpin a number of our core
  services,</q> explained Luca Filipozzi, member of the Debian
  System Administration (DSA) team.
</p>
<p>
  The donation of an enclosure, blade servers, and
  a SAN will allow DSA to build a virtual machine
  hosting environment at UBC (CA) that is functionally equivalent
  to the environment that Debian already has in place
  in the UK.  HPE's hardware donation enables Debian
  to achieve the high-availability, geographic redundancy,
  and partner independence in our services that our project
  colleagues demand and that our users have come to expect.
</p>
<p>
  The refresh of the infrastructure underlying
  ftp-master.debian.org and security.debian.org
  is vital to ensure that the project is able
  to produce and maintain the Debian operating
  system.  The former is an integral component
  of Debian's automated build environment, used
  daily by project members for package maintenance
  activities; while the latter is a critical
  service for our users as it provides the
  vehicle by which security updates are
  made available to them.
</p>
<p>
  It is only through the donation of volunteer
  effort, in-kind equipment and services, and
  funding that Debian is able to deliver on our
  commitment to a free operating system.  We
  are very appreciative of HPE's generosity.

<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>
  The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock
  to be a truly free community project.  Since then the
  project has grown to be one of the largest and most
  influential open source projects.  Thousands of
  volunteers from all over the world work together to 
  create and maintain Debian software.  Available in 70
  languages, and supporting a huge range of computer
  types, Debian calls itself the <q>universal operating
  system</q>.
