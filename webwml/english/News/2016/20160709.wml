<p>
Today, Saturday 9 July 2016, the annual Debian Developers 
and Contributors Conference came to a close. 
With over 280 people attending from all over the world, 
and 113 hours of talks in 114 events,
<a href="http://debconf16.debconf.org/">DebConf16</a> has been hailed 
as a success.
</p>

<p>
Highlights included the 
<a href="http://debconf16.debconf.org/open-festival/">Open Festival</a>,  
where events of interest to a broader audience were offered (ranging from topics 
specific to Debian to a wider appreciation of the open and maker movements), 
the traditional Bits from the DPL, lightning talks and live demos 
and the announcement of next year's DebConf (DebConf17 in Montreal).
</p>

<p>
For those not able to attend, talks and sessions were recorded and live streamed, 
and videos are being made available at the 
<a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2016/debconf16">Debian meetings archive website</a>.
</p>

<p>
Next year, DebConf will be held in Montreal, Canada, from 6 to 12 August 2017. 
For the days before DebConf the local organisers will again set up DebCamp,
a session for some intense work on improving the distribution, 
and the Debian Day on 5 August 2017, aimed at the general public.
</p>

<a href="http://debconf16.debconf.org/sponsors/">sponsors</a> 
to supporting DebConf16, particularly our Platinum Sponsor
