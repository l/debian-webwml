<p>As of 25 April, one year after the release of Debian 8, alias "Jessie",
and nearly three years after the release of Debian 7, alias "Wheezy",
regular security support for Wheezy comes to an end. The Debian <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/">Long Term Support (LTS)</a> Team
will take over security support.</p>

<h2>Information for users</h2>

<p>Wheezy LTS will be supported from 26 April 2016 to 31 May 2018.</p>

<p>For Debian 7 Wheezy LTS there will be no requirement to add a separate
wheezy-lts suite to your sources.list any more and your current setup
will continue to work without further changes.</p>

<p>For how to use Debian Long Term Support please read <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Using">LTS/Using</a>.</p>

<p>Important information and changes regarding Wheezy LTS can be found at <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Wheezy">LTS/Wheezy</a>.</p>

<p>Most notably OpenJDK 7 will be made the new Java default JRE/JDK on 26
June 2016 to ensure full security support until Wheezy LTS reaches its
end-of-life.</p>

<p>You should also subscribe to the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/">announcement mailing
list</a> for security updates for Wheezy LTS.</p>

<p>A few packages are not covered by the Wheezy LTS support. These can be
detected by installing the <a
href="https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/debian-security-support">debian-security-support</a>
package. If debian-security-support detects an unsupported package which is
critical to you, please get in touch with
<strong>debian-lts@lists.debian.org</strong>.</p>

<h2>Mailing lists</h2>

<p>The whole coordination of the Debian LTS effort is handled through the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/">debian-lts mailing list</a></p>

<p>Please subscribe or follow us via GMANE (gmane.linux.debian.devel.lts)</p>

<p>Aside from the debian-lts-announce list, there is also a <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-changes/">list for following all
uploads in Wheezy LTS</a>.</p>

<h2>Security Tracker</h2>

<p>All information on the status of vulnerabilities (e.g. if the version in
Wheezy LTS happens to be unaffected while Jessie is affected) will be
tracked in the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org">Debian Security
Tracker</a>.</p>

<p>If you happen to spot an error in the data, please see
<a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report</a>.</p>
