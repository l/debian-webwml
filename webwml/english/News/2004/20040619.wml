<p>This year's LinuxTag will take place from June 23rd to June 26th at
the exhibition and conference center in Karlsruhe, Germany.  The
Debian project will attend this show quite actively.</p>

<p>The Debian headquarter will be booth F43 in the exhibition hall, where
we will demonstrate Debian GNU/Linux on several different
architectures, hand out DVDs with a preview of sarge for the i386 and
powerpc architectures, demonstrate sub-projects such as FAI (Fully
Automatic Installation), Adamantix, Debian-Med and m23.</p>

<p>There will also be a Skolelinux booth/class room in the conference
building and a Linux Porting booth (F21) in the exhibition hall where
it is demonstrated that Linux runs on a large variety of hardware
platforms, with Debian as preferred operating system.</p>

Debian conference in room 2.05 in the conference building with the
following schedule:</p>

Not all talks with a relation to Debian fit on the Debian day, hence,
some of them will be delivered outside of it, and some of them are
part of the regular conference schedule.
