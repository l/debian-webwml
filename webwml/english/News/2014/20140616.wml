<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce that the <q>Long Term Support
(LTS)</q> infrastructure to provide security updates for Debian GNU/Linux 6.0
(code name <q>squeeze</q>) until February 2016 is now in place. Users of
this version should follow the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Using">instructions from the LTS wiki
page</a> to ensure that they get the LTS security updates.</p>

<p>We would like to thank the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Team">volunteers who joined the LTS
team</a> and the organizations which expressed their interest to
contribute to the LTS initiative:
<a href="http://www.intars.at/">AD&amp;D - IntarS Austria</a>,
<a href="http://www.deezer.com/">Deezer</a>,
<a href="http://www.edf.com/">Électricité de France</a>,
<a href="http://freeside.biz/">Freeside</a>,
<a href="http://www.offensive-security.com/">Offensive Security</a>,
<a href="http://www.positive-internet.com/">Positive Internet</a>,
<a href="http://www.seznam.cz/">Seznam.cz</a>,
<a href="http://www.sipwise.com/">Sipwise</a>,
<a href="http://www.univention.de/">Univention</a>,
<a href="http://www.ox.ac.uk/">University of Oxford</a>
and all the others who will join them in the coming months.</p>

<p>However, to ensure its success and cover more packages, more help is
needed: organizations benefiting from the extended support period are
encouraged to contribute manpower to the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development">LTS team</a>.

<p>For organizations that cannot contribute their own workforce to the LTS
team, <a href="http://www.freexian.com">Freexian</a> — a French company
owned by Debian Developer Raphaël Hertzog — offered to act as an intermediary
between organizations interested in funding LTS work, and individual Debian
contributors preparing LTS security updates. For more information, see
<a href="http://www.freexian.com/services/debian-lts.html">Freexian's description
of their proposal</a>.</p>

<p>The Debian Project welcomes this initiative, and is generally supportive
of organizations exploring ways to help sustain the LTS project and
Debian in general.</p>

<p>Should Debian 6 LTS be a success, it would be repeated and
generalized so that Debian 7 (<q>wheezy</q>) and Debian 8 (<q>jessie</q>)
would also benefit from Long Term Support.</p>
