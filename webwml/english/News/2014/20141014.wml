<p>
The Debian Project, provider of one of the earliest OS distributions in Linux’s
history, has chosen LeaseWeb Netherlands, part of global hosting  brand
LeaseWeb, to deploy and host their globally available Debian OS Snapshot
Archive with 80 Terabyte (TB) of capacity and ample room to grow.
</p>

<p>
The Debian OS Snapshot Archive, available at
<a href="http://snapshot.debian.org">http://snapshot.debian.org</a>, allows
access to old software packages accepted into Debian since the operating
system’s first release over twenty years ago. The snapshot archive provides
developers with access to an immense amount of historical information regarding
Debian packages, enabling software development including debugging and
patching.
</p>

<p>
The Debian snapshot archive is growing year-on-year, currently expanding at a
rate of more than 5 TB per year. As a result, The Debian Project needed a
hosting partner that could support its worldwide infrastructure needs.
</p>

<p>
As part of a three-year commitment, LeaseWeb Netherlands has provided a private
rack with storage servers to The Debian Project, housed in one of its data
centers located in the Amsterdam region. The solution provides Debian with an
improved user experience thanks to the additional bandwidth capacity, as well
as a direct connection to one of the world’s largest IP networks with more than
4.0 Tbps of bandwidth available.
</p>

<h2>Global availability</h2>

<p>
<q>The OS Snapshot Archive is extremely important for Debian,</q> said Luca
Filipozzi, core member of the Debian System Administration Team. <q>There are
thousands of Debian software packages on the snapshot platform. It contains
twenty years of history captured in a single place. If developers don’t have a
local repository available, they can easily find an old version from years ago,
which makes the archive a valuable asset to them. But to have it all available
online on a global base is a big request for most hosting providers. LeaseWeb
Netherland’s high-performance infrastructure and global reach ensures that our
snapshot archive is available to developers from anywhere in the world.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>Currently, this storage platform has a growth rate of about 5 TB per year, but
we can't accurately predict which packages will be updated in the years to
come,</q> added Filipozzi. <q>In the future we might need extra storage space, but
LeaseWeb Netherlands has provided us with a highly scalable storage solution
and good options for quickly adding large amounts of additional storage if
needed.</q>
</p>

<h2>Donation to the open source project </h2>

<p>
As The Debian Project is a registered non-profit open source initiative (under
SPI) with thousands of volunteers worldwide, LeaseWeb Netherlands is providing
its storage and hosting services free of charge as a donation to the open
source project.
</p>

<p>
The hosting provider is familiar with the open source OS, as a significant
number of its clients run a Debian distribution of the Linux OS. Around one
quarter of LeaseWeb Netherlands' customer base is running a Debian OS, usually
for web servers and mail servers. The remaining three quarters of its clients
opt for CentOS, Ubuntu (which is derived from Debian), FreeBSD, or Windows.
</p>

<p>
<q>Donations play a crucial role in supporting free and open source software
projects,</q> said Marc Burkels, ManagerBare Metal Servers, LeaseWeb. <q>LeaseWeb
developers are part of the Debian community, sharing their knowledge and
contributing code back. We want to honor and support the twenty years of effort
put into this rock-solid operating system.</q>
