News</a> has reported in their article ``The electoral test that
pencil and paper meet'' that Debian GNU/Linux will be used in an
electronic voting system for the ACT's October election in Australia.
They write: "The only platform that provided robustness and voter
confidence was GNU Debian Linux, with all source code released under
the General Public License (GPL)."

<p>The Canberra consultancy <a href="http://www.softimp.com.">Software
Improvements</a> won a $200,000 contract to provide an electronic
voting system.  "Online voting is a highly critical system, not in the
sense that someone's life depends on it, but it has to be accurate and
reliable and available on the day", said Carol Boughton of Software
Improvements, "The main reason we went that way (GPL) was transparency
and to be able to ensure the voters that everything is above
board. Once you make code available anyone has the opportunity to
check it out."

<p>The article continues with fear about using Open Source Software,
"Truly open source systems are valuable, but they pose threats, too,
because anyone can get and modify the code."  The "drawback" seems to
be that anybody can read and understand the code, finding flaws and
security issues.  "When you're writing in an open source environment,
you're forced to write for at least a degree of auditability.", they
say.
