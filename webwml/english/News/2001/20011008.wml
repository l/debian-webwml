<p>This week and the next one is going to be a busy one for the German
part of the Debian Project.  There are three exhibitions and
conferences taking place.  The Debian Project will have a presence at
all of them.

these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.
