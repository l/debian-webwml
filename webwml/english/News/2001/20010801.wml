<p>The <a href="http://www.demudi.org/">Debian Multimedia
Distribution</a> (DeMuDi) project is an effort to build a Linux
distribution for the purpose of multimedia work.  The Debian GNU/Linux
distribution already contains the tools for building and maintaining
such a distribution and will serve as the basis for this distribution.
Current Linux distributions either target web applications and services
or on desktop machines.  Multimedia and specifically multimedia
production capabilities have only recently been well integrated into the
Linux kernel.

<p>Currently, people who are interested in using the power of Linux to do
multimedia and artistic work must compile programs on their own and face
issues such as incompatible interfaces, availability of hardware drivers
and several other related issues, lowering to a considerable amount
artistic productivity.

<p>The Debian Multimedia Distribution tries to overcome these problems
by providing a customized distribution specifically for this kind of
user.  The <a
href="http://gige.xdv.org/pages/DeMuDi/pages/packages">package list</a>
contains prepackaged programs chosen by DeMuDi that the user can easily
install onto his system to have a fully-functional multimedia workspace.
Many packages targeted for integration into DeMuDi are already packaged
and part of the Debian distribution.

<p>DeMuDi is supported by the following organizations:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation Europe</a>
  <li> <a href="http://www.centrotemporeale.it/">Computer Music Institute</a>, Firenze
  <li> <a href="http://www.xdv.org/">Verein für experimentelle Datenverarbeitung</a>, Vienna
</ul>
