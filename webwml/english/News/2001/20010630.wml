<p>The upcoming week is going to be a busy one for the Debian Project.
We are going to be present on four exhibitions and conferences taking
place in the coming days, in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, and
Mexico.

<p>We invite all interested people in the respective areas to attend
these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss Debian and Free Software, and otherwise
participate in our vibrant community.

<p>Monday - Thursday

    <p>Debian Conference 1 is part of the Libre Software Meeting (LSM),
    an event where virtual organizations or "enterprises" engaged in
    Free Software development and support that ordinarily coordinate
    themselves via the Internet are given the opportunity to gather
    physically.
