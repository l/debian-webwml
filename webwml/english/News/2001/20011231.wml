<p>On January 1, 2002, twelve of the countries in the European Economic
and Monetary Union (EMU) will give up their own currencies and adopt
the new Euro (EUR) currency: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal, and Spain.  The Vatican City is also participating in the
changeover.  Countries that have used the currency of one of the above
countries will adopt the Euro as well.  This makes it a total of about
forty countries which will share the common currency.</p>

<p>Since the Euro currency is represented by a symbol of its own,
supporting this requires some adjustments in operating systems.
Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña wrote the
<a href="$(DOC)/manuals/debian-euro-support/">Debian Euro HOWTO</a> which
explains how to set this up on a Debian system.</p>

<p>It includes instructions for setting up the Euro symbol both on the
Linux console and in the X Window System.  Additionally, special Euro
packages were uploaded into testing/unstable
(<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/euro-support.html">\
euro-support</a>,
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/tex/tetex-eurosym.html">\
tetex-eurosym</a>) to provide easy support for the Euro symbol.</p>
