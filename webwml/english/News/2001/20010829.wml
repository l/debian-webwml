<p>Stephen van Egmond wrote an article reviewing Debian for BeOS users.

<p>"This article is a review of Debian GNU/Linux for users used to the BeOS,
and serves as a gentle introduction into the pain-free installation and
administration of the OS. The article leads the user through the
installation of Debian GNU/Linux and ReiserFS, security updates, an
upgrade to Woody, and the installation of X11, KDE, Koffice, and other
applications. The reader will also learn some of the Zen of Debian, and
gain an understanding of the routine maintenance that is required."
