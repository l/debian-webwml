<p>Jeremy Andrews of <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/">KernelTrap</a> spoke
with Neal Walfield from the GNU/Hurd development team who is also a
Debian developer working on the Hurd port.</p>

<p>From the interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Hurd is a radical departure from many UNIX concepts.  It is a
  unique and interesting approach to solving many of the problems
  found in current operating systems.  While it's not yet production
  grade, it is evolved enough to be quite usable.</p>

  <p>The Hurd is a set of servers that provide similar interfaces to
  those found in traditional Unix-like kernels.  The servers, each
  designed to do one task or manage one aspect of the system, run in
  user space thereby isolating them from both the kernel and each
  other.  This offers more power and flexibility to both the
  administrator and the user and, in doing so, increases system
  security."</p>
