<p>Two exhibitions and conferences are starting tomorrow.  The Debian
Project will have a presence at both of them.  We are sorry for the
late announcement, though.</p>

<p>We invite all interested people in the respective areas to attend
these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.</p>
