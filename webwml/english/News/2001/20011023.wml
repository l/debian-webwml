<p>Two exhibitions and conferences are starting tomorrow.  The Debian
Project will have a presence at both of them.  We are sorry for the
late announcement, though.</p>

<p>We invite all interested people in the respective areas to attend
these events, meet Debian developers and users, exchange GnuPG
fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.</p>

<p>
	   The aim of the Linuxdays is to promote and support the Open
	   Source &amp; Free Software movement.  This is the first Linux
	   conference in Luxembourg.

	   <p>Oliver Loch will give a talk about Debian GNU/Linux and the
	   Debian project, providing an introduction in the philosophy
