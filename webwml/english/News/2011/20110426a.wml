<p>The Debian project is proud to announce that it has again been choosen
as Mentoring organization for this year's <q>Google Summer of Code</q>.
This year nine students <a
href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/org/google/gsoc2011/debian">have
been accepted</a> and will be sponsored by Google during their summer
vacation to work on a specific task for a mentoring project.</p>

<p>They should soon be posting to report their progress on Debian's blog
aggregator <a href="http://planet.debian.org">Planet Debian</a> and you're
welcome to come talk to them on <tt>#debian-soc</tt> on
<tt>irc.debian.org</tt>.</p>

<p>Further details will be posted in the coming days on the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2011">related wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>The following projects have been accepted:</p>

<h2>Automated multi-Arch Cross-Building and Bootstrapping</h2>
<p><i>by Gustavo Prado Alkmim, mentored by Wookey</i></p>

<p>
Enable easy and automated setup of cross-platform automated build
systems and bootstrapping for QA in the Multi-Arch era. This involves
the creation of multi-stage bootstrap build sequencing tools and a
reliable automated multi-arch cross-builder.
</p>


<h2>APT/dpkg Transaction Ordering for Safety and Performance</h2>
<p><i>by Chris Baines, mentored by Michael Vogt</i></p>

<p>
The ordering code in libapt is responsible for ordering the
unpacking/configuration of debs so as to ensure dependencies are
satisfied etc. Currently it organizes the ordering into big batches.
This project further implements an ordering satisfying more constrains
such as <q>minimal amounts of dpkg invocations</q>, <q>minimal amount of broken
packages at any point</q>.
</p>


<h2>Debdelta APT Native Integration</h2>
<p><i>by Ishan Jayawardena, mentored by  Michael Vogt</i></p>

<p>
Improve user experience of APT and its front-ends by speeding up the
upgrade process. This provides a better framework for unified handling
of debdelta and future APT improvements such as parallelism. Support for
stable and security ugprades as well as multiple APT related libraries
is expected.
</p>


<h2>Dpkg Declarative Diversions</h2>
<p><i>by Sam Dunne, mentored by Steve Langasek</i></p>

<p>
The dpkg-divert command should be replaced with a new control file with
a declarative syntax which dpkg will parse and process directly as part
of the package unpack and removal phases, eliminating the problems
resulting from non-atomic handling of diversions.
</p>


<h2>Backend Tools and Infrastructure for DEX</h2>
<p><i>by Nathan Handler, mentored by Matt Zimmerman</i></p>

<p>
DEX is a new program designed to help improve Debian and its derivatives
by merging in changes made downstream and encouraging discussions
between the various projects. As this is a new project, most of the
infrastructure does not exist (or is rather hackish and incomplete).
This project will create the necessary backend tools and infrastructure
so that all Debian derivatives can easily make use of the DEX project.
</p>


<h2>Jigsaw Modularized Java in Debian</h2>
<p><i>by Guillaume Mazoyer, mentored by Tom Marble</i></p>

<p>
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a big monolithic software tool: many
of its features are only useful in limited areas (GUI toolkits are
useless for a web server). This project will bring the Jigsaw modular
JDK to Debian, helping performance (start-up, size, etc) but also the
dependency resolution (to match Debian packaging). Some work exists
upstream does not fit with Debian. This project will package the current
development version of Jigsaw, update Debian Java Policy, and create the
necessary packaging tools for software depending on it.
</p>


<h2>Python Multi-Build for Python Extensions Packaging</h2>
<p><i>by Mesutcan Kurt, mentored by Piotr O&#380;arowski</i></p>

<p>
This project creates a tool to build Python extensions for all Python
versions supported by Debian at the time. The project should detect the
upstream build system and testing frameworks and use them. It will be
interfaced with CDBS and the dh sequencer, replacing their Python snippets.
</p>


<h2>Debian Teams Activity Metrics</h2>
<p><i>by Sukhbir Singh, mentored by Andreas Tille</i></p>

<p>
This project will gauge the performance of teams in Debian by measuring
metrics such as: postings on relevant mailing lists, package upload
records from the Ultimate Debian Database and commit statistics from
project repositories... The information gathered will help in evaluating
team performance by measuring how people in a team are working together.
An interface to access this information easily will also be developed.
</p>


<h2>Compute Clusters Integration for Debian Development and Building</h2>
<p><i>by Rudy Godoy, mentored by Steffen Moeller</i></p>

<p>
The project's main goal is to enable developers to easily use compute
clusters (Eucalyptus, OpenStack...) as environments for arch-specific
development by providing a set of tools they can use to setup and run an
extended platform for their development, testing and building tasks.

<h2>About <q>Google Summer of Code</q></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.google-melange.com"><q>Google Summer of Code</q></a>
is a global program where university students are given a stipend to
write code for open source projects over a three month period. Through
<q>Google Summer of Code</q>, accepted students are paired with a
mentor from the participating projects, gaining exposure to real-world
software development and the opportunity for employment in areas
related to their academic pursuits. Best of all, more source code is
created and released for the use and benefit of all.</p>


<h2>About Debian</h2>

<p>
The Debian Project was founded in 1993 by Ian Murdock to be a truly
free community project. Since then the project has grown to be one of
the largest and most influential open source projects.  Thousands of
volunteers from all over the world work together to create and
maintain Debian software. Available in 70 languages, and
supporting a huge range of computer types, Debian calls itself the
<q>universal operating system</q>.
