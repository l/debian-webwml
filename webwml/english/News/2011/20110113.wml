<p>The Debian Installer team is pleased to announce the first release
candidate of the installer for Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>. 
</p>

<p>This release candidate includes the new SpaceFun artwork for Squeeze.
You can preview this artwork <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianArt/Themes/SpaceFun">on the wiki
page</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBW5qE1eDmM">watch a
video of it</a> in action.</p>

<p>This release candidate adds support for the Lao and Sinhala languages.
The keyboard support for Finnish has been fixed. In total 70 languages
are activated in the installer for Squeeze and for at least 57 of these
the whole installation process is translated.</p>

<p>The Linux kernel used by the installer has been updated to the latest
version of 2.6.32 available in Squeeze. The handling of non-free
firmware has had some usability issues fixed.</p>

<p>This release candidate adds support for three extra computer systems:
YDL PowerStation (PowerPC), QNAP TS-119P+ and TS-219P+ (ARM). This
release candidate has also seen several improvements on PowerPC
machines, including fan control improvements, IDE support for Efika
5200B, network support for IBM Power 6 and later System P boards and use
of unique filesystem identifiers and labels for more reliable booting.</p>

<p>Major improvements of the Squeeze installer over the Debian 5.0
<q>Lenny</q> installer include the automatic installation of recommended
packages, a rewrite of the <q>localechooser</q> component (which
language, timezone and mirror settings are based on),  btrfs and ext4 file system
support (while ext3 remains the default file system), and easier usage of
partitions for software RAID, LVM and crypto setups.  Besides supporting
more hardware, the Debian Installer can now also be used to install a
system based upon the FreeBSD kernel, which also supports the ZFS file
system.</p>

<p>Using an isohybrid technique, it is now easier to prepare USB or hard
disk based installations, as the netboot and business card ISO images can
now just be raw-copied to such a device.</p>

<p>More changes are available in the Debian Installer team's announcement
to the <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/News/2011/20110112">Debian
community</a>.</p>

<p>There are some <a
href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">known issues</a> with the installer that do not need to be
reported, but the Debian installer team do need your help to find more
bugs and further improve the installer, so please try it. Installer CDs,
other media and everything else you will need are available at the
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer">web site</a>.</p>
