<p>On March 22, 2011, the DebConf committee decided that DebConf12, the Debian
developer conference of 2012, will take place in Managua, Nicaragua. This
will be the first time DebConf takes place in Central America. The exact
dates have yet to be determined. More details may be found on the
<a href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf12">organizers' wiki</a>.</p>

<p>In a two-and-a-half hour meeting on Tuesday evening, the Managua bid
narrowly won over the bid from Belo Horizonte, Brazil. Teams had been
preparing their bids since mid-2010, seeking venues and local sponsors in
their respective cities and countries. </p>

<p>In thirteen years of DebConf history, this will be the first time that the
Debian developer conference takes place in the Central American region, it
is also the first time that the DebConf Team received a proposal from a
Central American country. Both teams did great work in their bids.</p>

<p>The DebConf organizers congratulate the future organizers of  DebConf12,
and thank both teams for their efforts. </p>

<p>The venue decision for DebConf13 will be made in twelve months. Proposals
should be submitted by 31 December 2011 to be eligible for
consideration.</p>

States.</p>

<p>This year, DebConf11 starts on Sunday 24 July, and ends Saturday 30 July

Open Day is a short conference aimed at Debian users, and others interested
