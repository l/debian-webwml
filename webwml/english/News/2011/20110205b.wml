<define-tag pagetitle>New look for Debian's websites</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::news


<p>On the occasion of the release of <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110205a">Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q></a>, the
Debian website team is pleased to publish a new design for Debian's web
presence.  After roughly <a
href="http://web.archive.org/web/19981212024258/http://www.debian.org/">13
years</a> with nearly the same design, the layout and design of many of the
websites run by Debian changed together with today's release of Debian
Squeeze.
Debian's <a href="$(HOME)">main website</a> and its <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/">wiki</a>, <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/">lists archive</a>, blog aggregator <a
href="http://planet.debian.org/">planet</a> and <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/">package information system</a> now have
a consistent new layout. The new layout is meant to give Debian's web
presence a cleaner and more modern look as well as making the web pages
easier to use and navigate.
</p>

<p><q>I didn't expect my slight annoyance to result in a published
redesign. The work others have done to make sure that happened has been
most impressive. Hopefully the redesign can start a refinement process that
will converge at the best distro website ever.</q> says Kalle S&ouml;derman, who
was one of the driving forces behind the layout change.  The website team
also took care that the new design includes accessibility improvements
(e.g. for the colorblind) and scales well for different resolutions.
