<h2>
DebConf12 to take place in Managua, Nicaragua in July 2012
</h2>

<p>
The Debian Project, 
the team behind the free Debian operating system, 
has confirmed the dates and venue for its next annual conference, 
DebConf12.
</p>

<p>
The conference will take place from July 8 to July 14 2012, in
Managua, Nicaragua. In DebConf's twelve-year history, this will be the
first time it will be held in Central America.
</p>

<p>
Every year, DebConf allows new and existing Debian project participants 
from around the world to assemble, share knowledge, make collaborative 
contributions to Debian, and build tighter community bonds. Conference 
costs are largely funded by corporate sponsors who find significant 
value in enabling Debian's success. 
</p>

<p>
<q>The members of the Debian community in Nicaragua, working together with
their fellow communities in Central America, are very excited to be
hosting this event, and are happy to welcome our colleagues from around
the world to join us in Managua at this very important and productive
conference</q> says Leandro G&oacute;mez, leader of the local team for DebConf12. <q>This
conference will boost the local Debian and Free Software communities and
help to bring awareness for the Debian Project, with new contributors
and enthusiasts from our country and the surrounding region joining the
Debian community and helping Debian to build the best operating system.</q>
</p>

<p>
DebConf will be preceded by a day when it opens its doors to the general
public, commonly called Debian Day. There will be talks and
demonstrations about the benefits of Debian and Free and Open Source
software in general to corporate, governmental, academic, and individual
users.
</p>

<p>
The call for papers and registration will open in early 2012. 
</p>

<p>
DebConf12 will be preceded by DebCamp, the yearly developer work 
sessions, starting on July 1.
