<h2>About DebConf</h2>

<p>DebConf is the Debian Project's developer conference. In addition to a
full schedule of technical, social and policy talks, DebConf provides an
opportunity for developers, contributors and other interested people to
meet in person and work together more closely. It has taken place annually
since 2000 in locations as varied as Spain, Argentina, and the United
States.</p>

<p>Previous Debian Conferences have featured speakers from around the
world.  They have also been extremely beneficial for developing key Debian
software components, including the new Debian Installer, and for improving
Debian's internationalization.</p>
