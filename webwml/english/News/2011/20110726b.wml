<p>
During this year's annual Debian Conference DebConf11 made the introduction of 
<q>multiarch support</q> a release goal for the coming Debian release 7 
<q>Wheezy</q> to be released in 2013. Multiarch is a radical rethinking of the 
filesystem hierarchy with respect to library and header paths, to make programs 
and libraries of different hardware architectures easily installable in parallel 
on the very same system.
</p>

<p>
<q>Multiarch is a major enhancement to Debian's ability to deliver on the 
promise of being a universal operating system</q> explains Steve Langasek, 
driving force of the implementation, <q>not only will it make crossbuilding 
easier, but also enables better support for legacy 32-bit applications on new 
64-bit installations and in the future will even allow live migrations from 
32-bit to 64-bit systems.</q>
</p>

<p>
People interested in the topic can watch the talk by Steve Langasek <q>Multiarch 
in Debian: 6 months (or 6 years) on</q> today at 16:00 CEST (14:00 UTC) by using 
the <a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/watch.xhtml">DebConf web frontend</a>.
