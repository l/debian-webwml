<p>The annual Debian Conference ended today after being held for the
previous
week in Banja Luka, Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina.  It has 
been a great success for the Debian Project.</p>

<p><q>DebConf is a vital event for Debian, both as a Free Software
distribution and as a project. To the distribution, DebConf offers "high
bandwidth" time that volunteers use to have socialise while hacking on
Debian. To the project, DebConf offers long lasting enthusiasm and the
ability to smooth the grudges which can be accumulated while communicating over the
Internet.</q> Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader explains the importance of the conference: <q>DebConf11 in Banja Luka has
been great on both sides and has also shown to many of us a culture and a
part of the world we were not familiar with. We will be back!</q>

<p>DebConf was preceded by DebCamp, an opportunity for contributors,
developers and teams to meet and work on specific issues and discuss face
to face.  As an example, the development team of Debian's installation system
met, and <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Debconf11Summary">amongst
other changes</a> integrated the recently released Linux Kernel 3.0,
improved the ports to the kFreeBSD and Hurd architectures, fixed issues
when using braille displays, and started the first integration steps of the
<q>CUT/rolling</q> release.</p>

<p>Other improvements done during DebCamp include the development of <a
href="http://dde.debian.net/debchanges/">RSS feeds</a> about the actual
content of the FTP archive, which will significantly ease the development
of services using this information.</p>


<p>A hot topic during DebCamp and DebConf was <a
href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/747.en.html">Multiarch</a>
(see also <a href="$(HOME)News/2011/20110726b">the separate announcement</a>) which makes programs
and libraries of different hardware architectures easily usable in
parallel on the same system.  For instance, the Embedded GNU C library 
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/glibc">eglibc</a> has seen some
development to support multiarch. Other highlights of the conference program
include <a
href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/705.en.html"><q>Delivering
Multi-Platform Applications</q> by Bdale Garbee</a> or the <a
href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/795.en.html">ARM BoF
session</a> which showed interesting details about the coming <q>armhf</q>
port.</p>

<p>During DebConf the video team consisting of about 50 volunteers managed to provide live streams for over
70 of the sessions, while recording 65 hours of video resulting in
800GB of data to be reviewed. After post processing the videos will be made
available on <a href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/pub/debian-meetings/2011/debconf11/">our
meetings archive</a>. Users may also thank the video team via a <a
href="http://wiki.debconf.org/wiki/DebConf11/Videoteam/Thanks">dedicated
wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>The Debian Conference was attended by over 400 contributors from over
70 countries ranging as far as New Zealand, Taiwan and Brazil.  Beside the
original scheduled 78 sessions, about 30 additional sessions where
scheduled during the conference.</p>

<p>The next annual Debian Conference will be held next year in <a
href="http://penta.debconf.org/dc11_schedule/events/719.en.html">Managua,
Nicaragua</a>.</p>
