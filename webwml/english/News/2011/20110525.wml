<p>The Debian project is proud to announce the availability of a new primary
mirror in mainland China. The new mirror, <a href="http://ftp.cn.debian.org">ftp.cn.debian.org</a>, will
significantly reduce network latency to the Debian software repositories
and help to raise Debian's profile in China, and is accessible via
IPv6 as well as via IPv4. Besides Debian's package archive, the
mirror also offers Debian's CD and DVD images as well as the
backports archive, and for users of Debian's oldstable release (<q>Lenny</q>), the Debian
volatile archive.</p>

<p>The Debian mirror team worked with Stephen Zhang and Aron Xu to set up the mirror in China. To quote
Aron, this will <q>significantly reduce the lag time</q> when synchronizing with
Debian's ftp-master server. Previously it was common to have a lag time of about
two days between ftp-master and China. With the new primary mirror, the
mirror team has been able to reduce that time to under six hours for push
clients and under twelve hours for passively synchronizing mirrors.</p>

<p>A primary mirror site has good bandwidth, is available 24 hours a day, and
has an easy to remember name of the form <tt>ftp.&lt;country code&gt;.debian.org</tt>.
Such a mirror is automatically updated whenever there are updates to the Debian
archive.</p>

<p>Hosting of the primary mirror in China is provided by the University of
Science and Technology of China.</p>


<h2>Usage of the new <tt>ftp.cn.debian.org</tt> mirror</h2>

<p>CD and DVD images can either be downloaded
<a href="http://ftp.cn.debian.org/debian-cd/">directly from the mirror</a>
or via the tool <a href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>.</p>

<pre>

<p>Of course users of the current testing and unstable distributions, <q>Wheezy</q>
and <q>Sid</q>, can also use the new mirror.</p>

<p>Please note that after changing the <tt>sources.list</tt>, users need
