<p>The Debian project is pleased to announce the forthcoming start of a
new round of IRC Training Sessions, which will be held on IRC by
experienced community members. There will be two different series of
sessions:</p>
<ol>
<li><q>Ask the ...</q>, dealing with the organization and structure of
the Debian project, will consist of talks delivered by people who have a
specific role within the Debian organization, taking a closer look at the
Debian infrastructure and constitution, plus a Q&A part.</li>
<li><q>One day with ...</q>, a more technical session, during which
people from various essential Debian teams will talk about their
packages, day-to-day tasks, and specific issues.</li>


<p>All sessions will be held on <tt>#debian-meeting</tt> channel on
irc.debian.org.
The first session, scheduled for Wednesday 22th at 19:00 UTC, will be
"Ask the DPL": Stefano Zacchiroli, current Debian Project Leader, will
tell us about what exactly the DPL does, according to the constitution,
folklore, and personal experience.
Future sessions will be held on a regular basis, and will deal with
various aspects of the Debian organization and different teams.
Please, visit the official <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/IRC/debian-meeting">wiki page</a> regularly
to check the up-to-date agenda and follow <a
href="http://identi.ca/debian">us on identi.ca</a>.
You may also refer to the wiki to suggest new topics or sign yourself up
as a trainer: we are always looking for more people to share knowledge
and complete the schedule, so don't be shy!</p>
