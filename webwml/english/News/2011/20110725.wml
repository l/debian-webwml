<p>DebConf 11, the annual Debian conference opened its doors today in Banja Luka, 
Republika Srpska, Bosnia and Herzegovina. As with previous conferences
streams of most sessions will be made available, allowing contributors who
couldn't attend the conference to still participate and send in questions
and comments via specific IRC channels. The easiest way to do so is via the
<a href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/watch.xhtml">DebConf Watch</a>
website, which also contains several useful other tabs.
</p>

<p>Yesterday the conference already commenced with the DebianDay, a
conference day aimed at a wider, local audience. It featured talks on
<q>Understanding Debian</q>,  <q>Debian in Enterprise: A Google Case
Study</q> and <q>How to contribute and get involved</q>. It was a great
success, not only bringing the Debian Community nearer to local
contributors, but also by catching the interest of the wider society as has
never happened before.</p>

<p>
So the opening ceremony was not only attended by Ćulibrk Predrag, General
Manager of m:tel, the biggest local internet and phone provider, but also
by Jasmin Komić, the Minister of Science and Technology and Aleksandar
Džombić, the Prime Minister. In a moving speech Milorad Dodik, the
President of Republika Srpska, who supported the idea of DebConf11 in Banja
Luka for the last two years, told the audience that he is proud to see that Banja
Luka and Republika Srpska succeeded to have DebConf11 here, even though
there was some fierce competition. Adnan Hodzic, local organizer, is hoping
that DebConf will attract the public's attention in Republika Srpska and
Bosnia and Herzegovina about what GNU/Linux and Debian systems are.
</p>

<p>
DebConf will last until July 31 and feature a 78 session program (not
including spontaneous <q>adhoc</q> sessions) which will include talks and
workshops on Multiarch, Ports to new architectures, and better collaboration
with derivative distributions, as well as an extensive social program. 
This year's conference is attended by over 400 participants from 50
countries.
