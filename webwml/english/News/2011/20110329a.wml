<p>Post-release testing showed up a variety of bugs in the images produced for
the <a href="$(HOME)/News/2011/20110319">6.0.1 update release</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Wrong installer code used for the <q>small</q> CDs</b><br />
    The script used to build the netinst and businesscard CDs was
    misconfigured, and was using the testing (Wheezy) version of Debian
    Installer instead of the correct Squeeze version.</li>

  <li><b>Incorrectly sized DVD images for some architectures</b><br />
    During the original 6.0.0 Squeeze release, we encountered problems in
    making some of the CD images fit; once the Squeeze release notes were
    added, the alternate KDE installation CD for several of the architectures
    grew too large. A number of last-minute tweaks were made on that release
    day to try to fix this, and the problem was mitigated. Unfortunately, (as
    is often the case with quick hacks in these situations) these tweaks did
    not work well in the next release and caused unforeseen problems. Various
    of the 6.0.1 images that should have been sized to fill a DVD were instead
    limited to approximately 700 MiB.</li>

  <li><b>Update CDs and DVDs missing Packages and Sources files</b><br />
    In between the Lenny and Squeeze releases, a fair amount of the code in the
    debian-cd package was refactored for clarity and to aid in maintenance.
    This also included deleting some older helper scripts that seemed to be
    redundant. Unfortunately, that conclusion was incorrect; two scripts were
    removed that were necessary for the correct operation of the <q>update-cd</q>
    script that generates the update CD and DVD images. Due to this oversight,
    on the day of the point release those images were created wrongly. They
    contained package and source data, but the meta data files Packages.gz and
    Sources.gz were missing.</li>
</ol>


<p>In each of the cases listed above, the failure case has been analysed and
is understood. Fixes for all of the problems have been developed, and
replacement images have been produced and tested. Following our normal
naming scheme, the new images are versioned <b>6.0.1a</b> to denote the bugfix
rebuild.</p>

<p>There is no need to download these new images for user who have already
downloaded previous images versioned as 6.0.1, if they are not affected by
one of the bugs listed above.  The easiest way to create fixed images for
users who are affected by these bugs, is to use <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/jigdo-cd/#how">jigdo</a> and scan the previous images
for already downloaded files.</p>

<p>We offer apologies for any inconvenience caused by these errors. The very
next task for the Debian CD team will be to integrate more extensive
automated QA for our CD images, in the hope that we will significantly
reduce the likelihood of bugs like these in the future.</p>
