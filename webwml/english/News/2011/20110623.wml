#use wml::debian::news

<p> The Debian project is proud to announce that the transition from
OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice has now been completed. LibreOffice has already
been available for <q>testing</q> and <q>unstable</q> since March and has now
been backported to Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>, too.  </p>

<p> Rene Engelhard, Debian's LibreOffice maintainer and member of LibreOffice's
Engineering Steering Committee, says: <q>I am sure Debian and its users will
benefit greatly from this transition; I expect not only an improved
collaboration but also quicker development cycles.</q></p>


<h2>Installation of LibreOffice</h2>

<p> Interested users of the current stable release Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q> may  add
the following line in their <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> file:
</p>

<pre>
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
</pre>

<p>
After adding this, perform an update and install the package
<tt>libreoffice</tt>  from the <tt>squeeze-backports</tt> suite using the
package management software of your choice (e.g. 
<tt>apt-get update ; apt-get install -t squeeze-backports libreoffice</tt>
). Previously installed OpenOffice.org
packages should be uninstalled automatically. Depending on the used desktop
environment, you might also have to install the <tt>libreoffice-gtk</tt>,
<tt>libreoffice-gnome</tt> or <tt>libreoffice-kde</tt> packages.</p>

<p>
More information on backports can be found on the <a
href="http://backports.debian.org/">backports.debian.org webpage</a>.
