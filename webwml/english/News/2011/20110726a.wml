<p>The Debian Project is pleased to announce that, through the donations
of various sponsors, it has been made a lot easier to provide interested
people with live video streams of sessions from Debian related
conferences. <q>While previous Debian Conferences only had video coverage
on a best effort basis, this one might be the first one with complete
coverage of all sessions!</q> says Holger Levsen, leader of the DebConf
Video Team; <q>Setting up the video gear has never been so easy! My teammate
Ben even had time to upload the Linux 3.0 kernel during the opening session,
since everything was running so smoothly.</q>.
This will be possible thanks to donations from <a
href="http://www.hp.com/go/linux">HP</a> and <a
href="http://www.irill.org/">IRILL</a>: the former provided several HP
EliteBook 2540s while the latter bought equipment worth about 15,000 Euros
including buy two professional cameras with tripods
plus two other cameras. IRILL will make this equipment available to the
DebConf video team for DebConf and Fosdem and provide safe storage for the
equipment when not in use.</p>

<p> <q>HP is pleased to be able to continue our long history of support of
the Debian Project through this donation, which will help many more people
around the world to benefit from the presentations at DebConf.</q> says
Bdale Garbee, HP Open Source and Linux Chief Technologist. <q>One of IRILL
goals is to foster collaboration between researchers and Free Software
developer communities. Making quality video material readily and publicly
available is one important means to achieve this goal.</q> says Roberto Di
Cosmo, director of IRILL. <q>We are thrilled to join forces and share
resources with Debian, whose video team has an impressive track record of
service to the community.</q> </p>

<p>
Both video streams and recordings will be available for all
DebConf11 talks and BoFs; the schedule of the conference and the relevant
links for the video streaming are available on the <a
href="http://debconf11.debconf.org/watch.xhtml">dedicated DebConf
page</a>.
The Debian Project thanks HP and IRILL for their generous support
and the DebConf Video Team for their amazing work.
