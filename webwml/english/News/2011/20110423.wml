<p>The Debian Project has lost an active member of its community. Adrian
von Bidder (cmot) died on April 17th.</p>

<p>Adrian was one of the founding members and current secretary of <a
href="http://debian.ch">debian.ch</a>, he sparked many ideas that made
Debian Switzerland be what it is today.  Adrian also actively maintained
software in the Debian package archive, and represented the project at
numerous events.  Even to those, who haven't worked with him directly, he
was well known for his sometimes thoughtful, sometimes funny blog posts.
</p>

<p>Adrian founded the <q><a href="http://www.pool.ntp.org/en/">NTP
Pool</a></q> (crowd-sourced time synchronisation), which our project has
since fully adopted.</p>

<p>The Debian Project honours his excellent work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software.  Adrian's broad technical knowledge and his
ability and consistent willingness to share that knowledge with others will
be missed.  The contributions of Adrian will not be forgotten, and the high
standards of his work will continue to serve as an inspiration to
others.</p>
