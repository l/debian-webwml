<p>
Currently the case of an alleged <q>cease and desist order</q> received by a
German Debian user is causing quite a stir. In a faked lawyer's letter the user was
accused of violating the rights of a Dutch company by distributing the Debian
operating system via BitTorrent.
</p>

<p>
It has now turned out that the <q>cease and desist order</q> was a
bad prank, and that the accusation as well as the Dutch company were made
up. Parallel investigations by the Debian Project had also resulted in the
conclusion that the Debian Project doesn't and never did distribute
any works of the (imaginary) Dutch company.
</p>

<p>
<q>Immediately contacting Debian and a lawyer was exactly the right
way to react.</q> says Alexander Reichle-Schmehl, Press Officer and
member of Debian's FTP Team: <q>Because of the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a> distributing the Debian
Operating System is perfectly legal, and is not only accepted but highly
encouraged by the Debian Project.</q>
