<p>On August 16th, the Debian Project will celebrate its 10th birthday
with several parties around the globe.  The Debian Project was
officially founded by Ian Murdock on August 16th, 1993.  At that time,
the whole concept of a "distribution" of GNU/Linux was new.  Ian
intended Debian to be a distribution which would be made openly, in
the spirit of Linux and GNU.  The creation of Debian was sponsored by
the FSF's GNU project for one year.</p>

<p>Debian was meant to be carefully and conscientiously put together, and
to be maintained and supported with similar care.  It started as a
small, tightly-knit group of Free Software hackers, and gradually grew
to become a large, well-organized community of developers and users.
To achieve and maintain high standards of quality, Debian has adopted
an extensive set of policies and procedures for packaging and delivering
software.  These standards are backed up by tools, automation, and documentation
implementing all of Debian's key elements in an open and visible way.</p>

<p>The most prominent guidelines are the <a
href="$(HOME)/social_contact#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> which are part of the Social Contract and which direct
Debian's interpretation of Free Software and upon which the Debian
distribution is based.  They were later adopted as the Open Source
Definition.</p>

<p>More than 1,100 people are registered as developers in the Debian
project and an additional two hundred have applied to join the
project's ranks.  Organisationally, the Debian Project has a <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/leader">project leader</a>, who is supported by a
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/secretary">secretary</a> and several <a
href="$(HOME)/intro/organization">delegates</a>.  The distribution is
tripartite these days, consisting of the stable release (current
codename ``woody''), the testing distribution (current codename
``sarge'') which will become the next stable release, and the unstable
distribution (codename ``sid'') with more than 12,000 binary <a
href="http://master.debian.org/~joey/archive/overview.html">packages</a>
where development efforts are primarily focused.</p>

<p>The Debian Project is celebrating its birthday at various <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/10years/">places</a> around the globe,
since a single large party doesn't seem appropriate for a project
which is spread <a
href="$(HOME)/events/materials/posters/worldmap/">worldwide</a>.  Some
parties are simply a social get-together at a restaurant, while others
are organised for larger audience.</p>

<p>The following list only enumerates the largest <a
