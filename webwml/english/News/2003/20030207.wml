<p>The Debian Project is a founding member of the <a
href="http://www.desktoplinuxconsortium.org/">Desktop Linux
Consortium</a> (DLC) which was recently founded and will be
incorporated as a non-profit association.  A recent <a
href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=results&amp;id=0124200313234">\
survey</a> on DesktopLinux.com indicated that Debian is the most
popular GNU/Linux Distribution for the Desktop.  The <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop/">Debian Desktop</a> sub-project is
an example of our continuing efforts to improve Debian for Desktop
GNU/Linux users.</p>

<p>The Desktop Linux Consortium is a vendor-neutral association which is
comprised of both commercial companies and open source organizations
that are developing and shaping GNU/Linux desktop technologies.  The
association will help shape the future of GNU/Linux on the desktop,
targeting the needs of corporate, institutional, and home users.</p>
