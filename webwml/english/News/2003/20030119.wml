        This conference is held prior to the Linux Conference
        Australia and many Debian people are going to attend the
        Debian mini-conference.  Talks given by Debian people range
        from topics like maintaining several Debian machines with

        installations with FAI to using IPv6 and Ham Radio with
        Debian.

fingerprints, discuss various topics on Debian and Free Software, and
otherwise participate in our vibrant community.</p>
