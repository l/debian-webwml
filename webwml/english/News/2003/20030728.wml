About 140 people attended this year's Debian conference, which took
place from July 18th to 20th at the University of Oslo, Norway.  Of
these circa 90 people attended the first Debian working camp which
preceded the conference from July 12th to 17th.  During debcamp more
than 200 bugs were fixed in the future debian-installer, which
demonstrates the success of this type of developers meeting.

Thanks to strong sponsorship from HP, NUUG Foundation, Lindows,
Trolltech, O'Reilly, Linpro (with Dell) and the University of Oslo
food, facility, abundant computing power and accommodation were free
of charge for attendants.  Many developers both from Europe and abroad
could be supported in their travels as well.  The strong support from
the Norwegian Unix User Group (NUUG) in planning and organisation made
the event go smoothly and left a professional impression.

The current Debian Project Leader, Martin Michelmayr was eminently
impressed with debcamp: "This year's debconf and especially the
preceding debcamp were a great success.  The idea of having a debcamp
in which people can work on various projects together was born during
last year's debconf and got realised this year.  We have seen that it
is very effective when you can put people who normally work together
via the Internet into a single room.  Many design and implementation
issues have been discussed and have successfully been resolved.  We
will try to hold more debcamps in the future, possibly smaller ones in
different countries."

Debian's coordinator for the conference, Andreas Schuldei, concluded:
"Especially communities that work together through the Internet need
this kind of gathering to become more successful.  I think that this
event has fulfilled its goal to inspire and motivate everyone
attending.  This was a striking example of Debian's vibrant community
and amazing variety."
