<p>The Debian Team has reinstalled security.debian.org on the host klecker,
which is hosted at XS4all in the Netherlands.  We apologize that it took
about two days to resurrect this important service, but we are happy that
it only cost two days.  Kudos to James Troup who did most of the work.
The current archive on security.debian.org was pulled from a mirror and
double checked before it was put online on the new host again.</p>

<p>Around 08:00 CET on November 20th, the University of Twente Network
Operations Center (NOC) caught fire.  The building has burnt to the
ground.  The fire department has given up every hope on protecting the
server area.  Among other things the NOC hosted satie.debian.org which
contained the security archive for the Debian distribution.</p>

<p>We expect the next security advisories to be sent out on Monday, since
all packages that were already prepared for release on Wednesday are lost
and need to be rebuilt.</p>

<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
