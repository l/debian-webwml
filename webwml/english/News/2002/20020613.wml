<p><a href="http://www.gibraltar.at/">Gibraltar</a> is a project that
aims to produce a Debian GNU/Linux-based 
router and firewall package.  This package will be bootable directly
from a CD-ROM, so hard disk installation will not be necessary.  This
can actually be a security feature since modifying the filesystem
won't be possible.

<p>Two versions of Gibraltar have been planned for release.  The free
version is now available as a testing release.  As for the commercial
version, which will come complete with a manual in addition to the
web-interface, the Gibralta developers are currently preparing for its
1.0 release.  Unfortunately, they are unable to give an exact release
date as it still requires more in-house development.

<p>The entire distribution can be downloaded as ISO image, ready to be
burned on CD-ROM, or as source packages.  Please find all relevant
files at a mirror, linked from <a
