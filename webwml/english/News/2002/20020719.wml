<p>The Debian Project is pleased to announce the release of Debian GNU/Linux
version 3.0.  Debian GNU/Linux is a free operating system, which now
supports a total of eleven processor architectures, includes KDE and GNOME
desktop environments, features cryptographic software, is compatible
with the FHS v2.2 and supports software developed for the LSB.</p>

<p>With the addition of the IA-64 (ia64), HP PA-RISC (hppa), MIPS (mips,
mipsel), and S/390 (s390) architectures, Debian GNU/Linux now supports a
total of eleven architectures.  It now runs on computers ranging from
palmtops to supercomputers, and nearly everything in between, including the
latest generation of 64 bit machines.</p>

<p>This is the first version of Debian that features cryptographic software
integrated into the main distribution.  OpenSSH and GNU Privacy Guard are
included in the default installation, and strong encryption is now present
in web browsers and web servers, databases, and so forth.  Further
integration of cryptographic software is planned for future releases.</p>

<p>For the first time, Debian comes with the K Desktop Environment 2.2 (KDE).
The GNOME desktop environment is upgraded to version 1.4, and X itself is
upgraded to the much improved XFree86 4.1.  With the addition of several
full-featured free graphical web browsers in the form of Mozilla, Galeon,
and Konqueror, Debian's desktop offerings have radically improved.</p>

<p>This version of Debian supports the 2.2 and 2.4 releases of the Linux
kernel.  Along with better support for a greater variety of new hardware
(such as USB) and significant improvements in usability and stability, the
2.4 kernel provides support for the ext3 and reiserfs journaling filesystems.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 features a more streamlined and polished installation,
which is translated into numerous languages.  The task system has been
revamped and made more flexible.  The debconf tool makes configuration of
the system easier and more user friendly.  Debian GNU/Linux can be installed
from CD, or from the network and a few floppies.  It can be downloaded now,
and will soon be available on CD-ROM from <a href="http://www.debian.org/CD/">\
numerous vendors</a>.</p>

<p>Upgrades to Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 from earlier releases are automatically
handled by the apt package management tool.  As always, Debian GNU/Linux
systems can be upgraded painlessly, in place, without any forced downtime.
For detailed instructions about installing and upgrading Debian GNU/Linux,
please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/woody/releasenotes">release
notes</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first release of Debian that is compatible with version 2.2 of
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).  Debian GNU/Linux now also supports
software developed for the Linux Standard Base (LSB), though it is not yet
LSB certified.</p>

<p>Current Debian users may be interested to know that this release of Debian
supports build dependencies, to aid in building packages from source, and
apt pinning, to ease partial upgrades to our testing or unstable branch.
This release of Debian features aptitude as an alternative for the
venerable dselect program, which will make it easier to select packages.
About four thousand new software packages were added to the distribution in
Debian GNU/Linux 3.0.</p>
