This web page contains useful information for users,
developers and translators who speak Catalan.

<h2><a name="translations">The Debian Catalan translation project</a></h2>

<p>This project aims to translate to Catalan the Debian web pages, the manuals
and the Debian-specific tools and programs, like the installation system or dpkg.</p>

<p>The group's coordinators are Jordi Mallach &lt;jordi@debian.org&gt;
and Guillem Jover &lt;guillem@debian.org&gt;. The
most direct way to contact the group is to write an email to our
<a href="mailto:debian-l10n-catalan@lists.debian.org">translation list</a>,
to which all the participating translators are subscribed.</p>

<p>In the future you'll be able to find a glossary of Debian-specific terms that
we have been compiling while we translated texts and software.</p>

<h2><a name="status">Translation status</a></h2>

<p>This is a probably incomplete list of the work that has been done.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Catalan support in the Debian installer.</p>
      <p>Debian 3.0 "woody" has been released with complete Catalan support
      in the install system. This includes the "dbootstrap" installer and
      "base-config", the Install Manual, Release Notes and other manuals.</p></li>
  <li><p>Coordination of the debian-l10n-catalan translation team.</p>
      <p>To smooth and speed the work we use a mail based automatic
      coordination system. You can see the current status of assigned
      translations on the <a href="http://ca.debian.net/">debian-l10n-catalan
      translation team coordination website</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Catalan support in various Debian tools.</p>
      <p>Debian 3.0 also shipped with Catalan support in the major
      Debian-specific tools, such as "dpkg", "debconf" and "modconf".
      Aside from these
      translated programs, Debian has Catalan support in many more
      applications, like GNOME or KDE, which are translated by non-Debian
      people. You can have a look at the general state of the Catalan
      translations of the applications included in Debian in the
      <a href="../l10n/po/ca">Central Debian translation statistics</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Translation of debconf templates for various packages.</p>
      <p>Although we haven't made much progress in this area, we are trying
      to translate the debconf templates to Catalan. You can see the current
      status of the Catalan templates in the <a href="../l10n/po-debconf/ca">\
      debconf templates translation statistics</a>.
      </p></li>
   <li><p>Translation of the web pages on www.debian.org.</p>
      <p>Web pages are also being slowly translated. Currently, the most
      important web pages are already translated, but there are still many
      pending. You can see the status of this effort in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/stats/ca">Debian website translation statistics</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
