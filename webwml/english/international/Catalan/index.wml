<h1>The Debian webpages in Catalan</h1>

This webpage contains useful information for Catalan-speaking users,
developers and translators.

<h2><a name="mailinglists">Debian mailing lists in Catalan</a></h2>

<p>Currently there are two Debian lists in Catalan:</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-catalan/">debian-user-catalan</a>, a list for catalan-speaking users.</p>
  <p>This list is used to solve any doubt regarding the usage of the Debian
  system or for any announcements that are useful for users (organization
  of meetings, etc).</p></li>
  <li><p><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-catalan/">debian-l10n-catalan</a>,
  the coordination list of Debian's Catalan translation effort.</p>
  <p>Ongoing translations are organized and discussed in this list.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>To subscribe to any of them, please send a message to
debian-<i>&lt;list&gt;</i>-catalan-request with
<blockquote>
	<code>subscribe <i>&lt;your_mail_address&gt;</i></code>
</blockquote>
in the message <em>body</em> (not in the subject). Alternatively, you can use
the web forms to <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">
subscribe</a> or <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> to
the named lists.</p>

<h2><a name="translations">The Debian Catalan translation project</a></h2>

<p>This project aims to translate to Catalan the Debian webpages, the manuals
and the Debian-specific tools and programs, like the install system or dpkg.</p>

<p>The group's coordinator is Jordi Mallach &lt;jordi@debian.org&gt;. The
most direct way to contact the group is to write to our
<a href="mailto:debian-l10n-catalan@lists.debian.org">translation list</a>,
to which all the participating translators are subscribed.</p>

<p>In the future you'll be able to find a glossary of Debian-specific terms that
we have been compiling while we translated texts and sofware.</p>

<h2><a name="status">Translation status</a></h2>

<p>This is a probably incomplete list of the work that has been done.</p>

<ul>
  <li><p>Catalan support in the Debian installer.</p>
      <p>Debian 3.0 "woody" has been released with complete Catalan support
      in the install system. This includes the "dbootstrap" installer and
      "base-config", the Install Manual, Release Notes and other manuals.</p></li>
  <li><p>Catalan support in varied Debian tools.</p>
      <p>Debian 3.0 also shipped with Catalan support in the major part of the
      Debian-specific tools like "dpkg", "debconf" or "modconf". Besides these
      translated programs, Debian has Catalan support in a lot more
      applications, like GNOME or KDE, which are trasnalted by non-Debian
      people. You can have a look at the general state of the Catalan
      translations of the applications included in Debian in the
      <a href="../l10n/po/ca">Central Debian translation statistics</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Translation of debconf templates for various packages.</p>
      <p>Although we haven't made much progress in this area, we are trying
      to translate the debconf templates to Catalan. You can see the current
      status of the Catalan templates in the <a href="../l10n/templates/ca">\
      debconf templates translation statistics</a>.</p></li>
  <li><p>Translation of web pages in www.debian.org.</p>
      <p>Web pages are also being slowly translated. Currently, the most
      important webpages are already translated, but there are still many
      pending. You can see the status of this effort in the 
      <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/stats/">Debian website translation statistics</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
