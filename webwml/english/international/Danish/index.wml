# This is a _translation_ of the original version found in 
# "danish/international/Danish".
#
# Inspired by /swedish, and because I can't help it, first a short introduction 
# to the Danish language.  You're of course not supposed to translate these 
# comments and may delete them from you translation.
#
# The following ISO-8859-1 letters may/will be used throughout this document.
#
# Danish:
#   æ => &aelig;  Æ => &AElig;
#   ø => &oslash; Ø => &Oslash;
#   å => &aring;  Å => &Aring;
#
# Faroese:
#   ð => &eth;    Ð => &ETH;   (and possibly others if more links are added)
#
# Please note that all references to "Danish" refer to the language, not to 
# the pastry. :-)
#
# The Danes live in Denmark and speak Danish.
# 
# Danish is the primary language in Denmark, and is a secondary, but necessary,
# language in Greenland and the Faroe Islands (a small group of islands in 
# the Atlantic Ocean) - Greenland and the Faroe Islands are both part of the 
# Kingdom of Denmark, but have Home Rule.  Danish is also a recognized minority
# language in Northern Germany.  The language may also still be taught in 
# schools in Iceland (which was a Home Rule part of the Kingdom of Denmark 
# until WW1, and became a sovereign nation during WW2).

<p>We have collected a number of links to resources which may be of interest 
to Danish speaking Debian users in Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands.
There are also lists of Debian developers and translators from Denmark.</p>
