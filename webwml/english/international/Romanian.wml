      <li><strong>The Debian Romanian Localization Team</strong> translates into
      Romanian Debian specific documents, packages' configuration
      messages and applications present in Debian. Any new members in
      the team are welcome. The coordination is mainly done via the
      <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-romanian/">\
      debian-l10n-romanian</a> mailing list. More detailed information
      can be found on the
      <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/L10N/Romanian/">RomanianL10N wiki page</a>.</li>
      <li>As there is currently no debian-users-romanian mailing list,
      you are also welcome to address (in Romanian) any Debian
      specific questions you might have to the
      <a href="mailto:debian-l10n-romanian@lists.debian.org">\
      localization mailing list</a>.</li>
      <li>There is a <a href="http://www.debian.ro">Romanian site</a>
      dedicated to Debian.</li>

<p>Romanian pages at Debian were changed to reflect the new Romanian
orthography (the transition to &#226;).
See <a href="http://bucovina.chem.tue.nl/reguli_ortografie/index-en.htm">text
convertors</a>.</p>

<p>About Debian conversion to the new standard for diacritics
(comma below &#537; and &#539;) see
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/L10N/Romanian/CommaTransition">here</a>.</p>

<p>Romanian pages on Debian sites were moved to UTF-8 on 12 Aug 2007, and the
new diacritics are used since 20 Dec 2008 close to the lenny release due to some
compatibility issues with other older operating systems (etch has no problems
if correct fonts are used, ex. DejaVu).</p>

<p>The use of correct diacritics is regulated by law in Romania.</p>

<p>For a detailed description of the problem see
the wiki page with the Lenny release notes specific for Romanian users
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/L10N/Romanian/Lenny/Notes"> or
<a href="http://www.secarica.ro/html/s-uri_si_t-uri.html">Cristian
Secar&#259;'s site</a> (only in Romanian language). Also there
you can find informations about how to fix this problem on your computer.</p>
