<H1>Debian Goes International</H1>

<HR>

<P>This page contains links to pages containing information on the availability
of Debian in various languages. It is hoped that all Debian documentation,
software and the installation will be available in every language.
To facilitate that, each languages' page has information on Debian
resources that are available in that language, including any mailing
lists.

<H2>The Debian web site and content negotiation</H2>

<P>The Debian web site uses <A href="../intro/cn">content negotiation</A> to
automatically deliver web pages in your preferred language - if your browser
is configured properly and a page exists in that language. We have created a
page that explains <A href="../intro/cn">how to set up the preferred language for
your browser</A>.

<H2>Adding support for a new language</H2>

<P>Debian is run completely by volunteers. If we don't currently support
your language, you should consider organizing an effort to do so.
To fully support a language, the following areas of Debian must be
worked on:
<UL>
  <LI>Installation Disks. Work relating to the installation of Debian
      is discussed on
      <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>.
  <LI>Debian Documentation. This is discussed on
      <a href="mailto:debian-doc@lists.debian.org">debian-doc@lists.debian.org</a>.
  <LI>Debian web pages. This is discussed on
      <a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>.
      For information on translating the Debian web site, see
      <a href="../devel/website/">Helping with the Debian Web Pages</a>
</UL>
# Additionally, some languages may need some software packaged
# to support your character set. This is mostly a concern for languages
# with a multi-byte character set.

<P>Supporting a language is an ongoing effort. It is not enough to simply
translate some documents. Everything changes with time and all documentation
must be kept up to date. It is thus suggested that a group of people get
together to share the load. A good way to get started is to request
a Debian user mailing list for your language. Requests of this nature
should be sent to
<a href="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</a>.
