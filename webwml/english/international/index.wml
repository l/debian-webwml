#use wml::debian::template title="Debian International"

<p>In the free software community on the Internet we communicate mostly in
the English language. Most of our work is done in English, but it is hoped
that all Debian documentation, software and the installation will be
available in every language one day. We are constantly working towards that
goal, however, many obstacles are still ahead.

<H2>The Debian web site and content negotiation</H2>

<P>The Debian web site uses <A href="../intro/cn">content negotiation</A> to
automatically deliver web pages in your preferred language - if your browser
is configured properly and a page exists in that language. We have created a
page that explains <A href="../intro/cn">how to set up the preferred language for
your browser</A>.

<H2>Adding support for a new language</H2>

<P>Debian is run completely by volunteers. If we don't currently support
your language, you should consider organizing an effort to do so.
To fully support a language, the following areas of Debian must be
worked on:
<UL>
  <LI>Installation Disks. Work relating to the installation of Debian is
      discussed on <a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">
      <tt>debian-boot</tt></a> mailing list.
  <LI>Debian Documentation. This is discussed on
      <a href="mailto:debian-doc@lists.debian.org"><tt>debian-doc</tt></a>
      mailing list. Also see <a href="../doc/ddp">documentation project's
      web pages</a>.
  <LI>Debian web pages. This is discussed on
      <a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org"><tt>debian-www</tt></a>
      mailing list. For information on translating the Debian web site, see
      <a href="../devel/website/">Helping with the Debian Web Pages</a>.
</UL>
# Additionally, some languages may need some software packaged
# to support your character set. This is mostly a concern for languages
# with a multi-byte character set.

<P>Supporting a language is an ongoing effort. It is not enough to simply
translate some documents. Everything changes with time and all documentation
must be kept up to date. It is thus suggested that a group of people get
together to share the load. A good way to get started is to
<a href="../MailingLists/HOWTO_start_list">request a Debian user mailing
list</a> for your language.

<H2>The Debian language pages</H2>

<P>These pages contain information on using Debian in non-English languages.
Each language's page has information on Debian resources that are available
in that language, including any mailing lists.

#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/international/index.data"

<H2>Central Debian translation statistics</H2>

<P>We maintain a <a href="l10n/">translation statistic</a> which contains
data on the translated message catalogs in Debian packages.
