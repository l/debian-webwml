<h1>Debian in Dutch-speaking countries and territories</h1>

<p>Debian aims to be a universal operating system.
This results in Debian not only running on a variety of computer
architectures, but also wanting to be available in as many languages
and accessible for as many people as possible. Therefore it is not
surprising that Debian, originated in the US and using
English as its primary language, evolved into a global
network of volunteers with a worldwide userbase.</p>
<p>In the Dutch-speaking countries and territories around the world there are
several Debian developers as well as many others who contribute to Debian by
offering user support, translating the operating system into Dutch
or converting Debian web pages so that Dutch-speakers can read them in
their native language.</p>

<h2>Debian for its Dutch-speaking user base</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">The Debian <q>Social Contract</q> with the Free Software Community</a></li>
  <li><a href="$(HOME)/intro/cn">Read the Debian web pages in your own language</a></li>
  <li>Dutch mailing list for Debian users:

<h2>Helping out with the translation of Debian</h2>

<p>We have the ambition to make the Debian operating system and
its documentation also available in Dutch.
This can be of great help for people who lack a good command
of English. For children especially, the lack of a Dutch translation
can be an important barrier.</p>
<p>Like the development of the Debian operating system itself,
its translation also relies on volunteers. If
you might have some spare time and a reasonable command of
English, then you could consider contributing too. If such an idea looks
appealing to you, please find additional information
at the following locations:</p>
  
  
<ul>
  <li>At the <a href="dutch/index.html">project website</a> of the
  Debian translation project you will find additional information
  on the translation of Debian into Dutch.</li>
  <li>The Dutch translation is coordinated on this mailing list:
  <a href="mailto:debian-l10n-dutch@lists.debian.org">
  debian-l10n-dutch@lists.debian.org</a>
  (<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-dutch/">archives
  and subscription pages</a>).</li>
</ul>
