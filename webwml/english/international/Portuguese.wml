<H1>Debian in Portuguese</H1>

<P>This page gives you specific information about our
translation efforts, in an attempt to get Debian in Portuguese. Our team
is composed by Brazilians only, and, because of that, there is a great
dominance of Brazilian Portuguese on the pages. This team, which is
formed by both Debian developers and users, is gathered together in a
project called <a href="http://debian-br.alioth.debian.org">Debian-BR</a>.

<P>To know how to subscribe yourself to the mailing lists for
Portuguese-speaking users, as well as instructions to join us on our IRC
channel, visit our
<a href="http://debian-br.alioth.debian.org/index.php?id=Listas">IRC/List section</a>
of the <a href="http://debian-br.alioth.debian.org">project's page</a>.

<P>To have access to documentation in Portuguese, including the
installation manual and a tutorial explaining the use of dselect and
apt, visit the <a href="http://debian-br.alioth.debian.org/index.php?id=Documenta%E7%E3o">\
Documentation section</a> of the page.

<P>To get the latest news on the Debian world in Portuguese, visit the
<A href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/">News
section</A> of the page.

<P>To know about Debian community in Brazil, the users and developers,
and register yourself in our Brazilian Debian User's Counter, visit the
<a href="http://debian-br.alioth.debian.org/index.php?id=Comunidade">Community section</a>
of the page.

<P>If you <strong>really</strong> want to help develop even further
Debian GNU/Linux, by helping on it's localization and
internationalization to Portuguese, have a look at the other info on
our project page, or send a <a href="mailto:debian-br@listas.cipsga.org.br">
message</a>.

<P>Even though we have "-BR" in our Project's name, we have several
friends from Portugal in our mailing lists and IRC channel, and all
Portuguese-speaking users that are willing to join us are welcome to do
so.

<P>Thanks!
<P>The Debian-BR Team
