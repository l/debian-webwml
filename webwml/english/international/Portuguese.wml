<H1>Debian in Portuguese</H1>

<P LANG=pt_BR>This page gives you specific information about our
translation efforts, in an attempt to get Debian in Portuguese. Our team
is composed by brazilians only, and, because of that, there is a great
dominance of brazilian Portuguese on the pages. This team, which is
formed by both Debian developers and users, is gathered together in a
project called <A href="http://debian-br.sourceforge.net">Debian-BR</A>.

<P>To know how to subscribe yourself to the mailing lists for
Portuguese-speaking users, as well as instructions to join us on our IRC
channel, visit our

installation manual and a tutorial explaining the use of dselect and
apt, visit the <A href="http://debian-br.sourceforge.net/documentacao.html">

Debian GNU/Linux, by helping on it's localization and
internationalization to Portuguese, have a look at the other info on
our project page, or send a <A href="mailto:debian-br@listas.cipsga.org.br">
message</A>.

<P>Even though we have "-BR" in our Project's name, we have several
friends from Portugal in our mailing lists and IRC channel, and all
Portuguese-speaking users that are willing to join us are welcome to do
so.

<P>Thanks!
<P>The Debian-BR Team
