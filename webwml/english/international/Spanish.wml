<P>Currently, a great effort is being developed in order to internationalize
Debian to the Spanish language, at many different stages and due to the
amount of work by different people, coordinated by Debian developers.</P>

<P>The internationalization effort is coordinated through the
<a href="lists.debian.org/#debian-l10n-spanish">debian-l10n-spanish</a> list.
If you are interested in <strong>contributing</strong>, you should
first take a look at the <a href="spanish/proyectos">ongoing projects</A>.
Also, take a look to the
<A HREF="spanish/coordinacion">coordination pages</A> and discuss the
issues that you deem convenient in 
the <A HREF="mailto:debian-l10n-spanish@lists.debian.org">translators
list</A>.</p>

<P>If you want to take a look at other projects related to the translation of
Linux into Spanish, please check out the Spanish translation of the
<A HREF="$(HOME)/misc/related_links.es.html">related links page</A>.

<P>Currently, the Spanish speakers and Debian users can see the results of
this effort through:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#listas">the mailing lists</A>.
<LI><A HREF="#doc">the translated documentation</A>.
<LI><A HREF="#www">the translation of the web site</A>.

<H2><A NAME="listas"></A>Mailing lists.</H2>

<P>There is a mailing list for Spanish speaking users. In order to subscribe,
send a mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-user-spanish-request@lists.debian.org">debian-user-spanish-request@lists.debian.org</A>
with<br>

<tt>
subscribe &lt;your_e-mail&gt;
</tt>
in the mail's body.</p>

<P>You can use this list to solve or discuss issues related to Debian if your
knowledge of English hinders you from using 
debian-user@lists.debian.org (where you will find a bigger audience but 
maybe also more noise). In particular, you can find help on how to adapt your
Spanish system to Debian you might not be able to find on other mailing lists.</P>


<P>The list has some traffic, but there are usually answers for most problems in 
the same day. Also, most Spanish Debian developers are subscribed to the list.</P>

<H2><A NAME="doc"></A>Documentation.</H2>

<P>The documentation in Spanish about Debian is quite big, although not many of the "official" Debian 
documents  have been translated. The Debian server is being prepared in order to serve the
translated documentation (when available) transparently to the users.</P>


<P>The coordinator of the translation team is 
<A HREF="mailto:ender@debian.org">David Martínez Moreno</A>.
If you are only interested in doing a single translation, send him the
translation of <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/ddp">Debian Documentation Project</A>
you have made in order for him to include them in the 
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/?cvsroot=debian-doc">CVS server</A>. If you
plan to commit more of your precious time and do more work overtime, please to subscribe to 
debian-l10n-spanish in order to coordinate your efforts with the rest of the
translation team.</p>

<P>Take a look <a HREF="spanish/ok">here</A> to see the documents that have already
been translated, or visit <a href="spanish/coordinacion">coordination pages</A>.</P>

Spanish:

<H2><A NAME="www"></A>Translation of the web site</H2>

<P>The translation of the web site is a continuous effort due to the 
inclusion of new contents as time goes by, it is not possible to have 100%
of the site translated.
Read <A HREF="$(DEVEL)/website/">Helping with the Debian Web Pages</A> if you 
want to help translating this site. If you have configured your
browser properly (<A
HREF="$(INTRO)/cn">read here how to do it</A>) you will be able to read the
pages in Spanish. Those pages still appearing in English may
not be translated yet.</P>

<P>Almost all of the pages inform on whether the translated version is
out of date against the original version (usually in English, although this
page's original version, for example, is in Spanish). If you are not really sure
if you are reading the latest information, check the links on the page footer to
access the English version.</p>

<H2><A NAME="pack"></A>Interesting packages for Spanish users</H2>

<P>There are several Debian packages that are of special interest for the
Spanish-speaking Debian users.
If you talk Spanish, we recommend you install the following packages:

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/user-es">user-es</A> 
(read the documentation before you execute the <tt>castellanizar</tt> program). This package will probably
be integrated in a near future with other <tt>user</tt>-packages in a package called <tt>language</tt>.
<li><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/doc-debian-es">doc-debian-es</A>. The Debian FAQ translated to Spanish.
<li><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/doc-linux-es">doc-linux-es</A>. Translation of documents for the Linux Documentation Project (HOWTOs) into Spanish.
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/manpages-es">manpages-es</A>. The Spanish manpages, for a more up-to-date version always check <a href="http://lucas.hispalinux.es/htmls/pameli.html">LuCAS</A>.
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/ispanish">ispanish</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/wspanish">wspanish</A>
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/ayuda">ayuda</A>, a simple program that offers help to the
user through a menu system.
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/fortunes-es">fortunes-es</A>, cookies in Spanish for the most
famous cookie program.
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/i2e">i2e</A>, a Spanish-English dictionary for users and
translators.
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/ldp-es">ldp-es</A> and <a HREF="http://packages.debian.org/lucas">lucas</A>, the LuCAS documentation packaged in order to install it in Debian for offline reading.

<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/linux-tutorial">linux-tutorial</A>, a
Linux tutorial in Spanish.
<li><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/dict-glosario">dict-glosario-inet</A>,
ATI's glossary packaged for Debian (not available yet)
</UL>
<P>If you want to be a Debian developer install also:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/maint-guide-es">maint-guide-es</A>
</UL>
<P>Debian 2.2 comes with a task for Spanish-speaking users, when you install
this task many of the packages presented above will be installed also. The profile
is called <A
HREF="http://packages.debian.org/task-spanish">task-spanish</A>.

<H2><A NAME="distrib"></A>Spanish Debian distributions.</H2>

<P>We recommend Spanish-speaking users to make use of the
<a HREF="http://www.id-agora.com">Citius Debian</A> distribution, which includes
the full Debian installation translated into Spanish and a Debian manual. You
will also be able to find Spanish documentation from projects outside of Debian.</p>


<P>In any case, take a look at <A HREF="../CD/vendors/">the vendors list</A> 
in order to see which vendors might sell a Spanish distribution.</P>


<H2><A NAME="prog"></A>Programs in Spanish</H2>

<P>The translation team does not, for the moment, translate the programs in Debian
into Spanish if they have not been developed by Debian. Some programs, like
<tt>dpkg</tt> or <tt>dselect</tt> have been internationalized by Debian developers,
by this is not the norm.

<P>Take a look at <a href="http://www.debian.org/intl/l10n/po-es">the Debian translation
monitor</A> to see which packages have been translated in Debian.</P> 


<P>If your favorite program is not yet internationalized in Debian (ensure that you have
appropriate values for LANG, LC_ALL and LC_MESSAGES in your environment) it might
be possible that the original version is not yet internationalized. You can collaborate in
order to provide internationalization support: read on the GNU tool
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/gettext.html">gettext</A> for
information on how to internationalize programs in a simple and standard way.

<P>You can contribute your work through the 
<a HREF="http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/">Free Translation Project</A>.
If you wish to see the state of current translations check out the 
<A
HREF="http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~pinard/po/registry.cgi?team=es">database</A>
of translations and translators</P>.


# Debería estar esto aquí?
<H2><A NAME="developer"></A>Spanish-speaking Debian developers</H2>

<P>The following Debian developers are Spanish-speaking, you can see that
not having English as you native language is not an
impediment for  collaborating in Debian.</P>
<P>Developers frequently cooperate with other Spanish-speaking users in the
mailing list for Spanish speaking users, and they also develop packages that
are of interest for the same users. If you have developed 
a package that is not in Debian, or wish to become a Debian developer
get in touch with them (for key-signing, for advocacy in the process..)
using the mailing list 
<em>debian-devel-spanish@lists.debian.org</em>.
