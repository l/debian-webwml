<H1>Debian in Finnish</H1>

<p>There is a Finnish Debian mailing list at <a
href="mailto:debian-fi@fishpool.com">&lt;debian-fi@fishpool.com&gt;</A>.
One can subscribe to the list in the normal majordomo
fashion, by sending a mail to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@fishpool.com">&lt;majordomo@fishpool.com&gt;</A>,
with the content</p>
<PRE>
  subscribe debian-fi
</PRE>
<p>and nothing more.</p>

<p>Also there is another Finnish mailing list for Finnish
localization.  This list is at Debian's servers, therefore you can
find list's archives and (un)subscibe help at <url
"http://lists.debian.org/debian-l10n-finnish/">.</p>

<LI>Installation instructions are available in Finnish <A
HREF="../releases/potato/installmanual">where all the other installation
manuals are</a> (if <a href="../intro/cn">the browser is set up</a>
correctly).  

<li>Debian WWW page translation to Finnish is being coordinated by
Tommi Vainikainen
<a href="mailto:thv+debwww@iki.fi">&lt;thv+debwww@iki.fi&gt;</a>.

this for Debian releases 2.1 (slink) and 2.2 (potato).
