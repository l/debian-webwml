<H1>Debian in Finnish</H1>

<p>There is a Finnish Debian mailing list at <a
href="mailto:debian-fi@fishpool.com">&lt;debian-fi@fishpool.com&gt;</A>.
One can subscribe to the list in the normal majordomo
fashion, by sending a mail to <a
href="mailto:majordomo@fishpool.com">&lt;majordomo@fishpool.com&gt;</A>,
with the content
<PRE>
  subscribe debian-fi
</PRE>
and nothing more.

<LI>Installation instructions are available in Finnish <A
HREF="../releases/slink/#new-inst">where all the other installation
manuals are</a> (if <a href="../intro/cn">the browser is set up</a>
correctly).  

<LI>Debian WWW page translation to Finnish is being coordinated by
Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho <A
HREF="mailto:ajk@debian.org">&lt;ajk@debian.org&gt;</A>. If you want
to come along, just send email.

<LI>Boot disks are being translated to Finnish.  The effort is
coordinated by Tapio Lehtonen <A
HREF="mailto:tale@debian.org">&lt;tale@debian.org&gt;</A>.  Any help
is appreciated.
