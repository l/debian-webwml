<h1><a name="sandlistor">Mailing lists</a></h1>

<p>
The official mailing list for Debian in Swedish is debian-user-swedish.
You can subscribe to it
<a href="../MailingLists/subscribe#int">via the web</a>
or by sending mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-user-swedish-request@lists.debian.org">
debian-user-swedish-request@lists.debian.org</a>
with the word "subscribe" as the subject.
All messages sent to the list are
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-user-swedish">archived</a>.

<p>
If you think that you cannot find enough help on the Swedish language list,
and you have no problems writing or reading English, there is also the main
support mailing list, debian-user.
Also this list can be subscribed to
<a href="../../MailingLists/subscribe#user">via the web</a>
or by sending mail, this time to
<a href="mailto:debian-user-request@lists.debian.org">
debian-user-request@lists.debian.org</a>
with the word "subscribe" as the subject.
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-user-swedish">Archive</a>.
