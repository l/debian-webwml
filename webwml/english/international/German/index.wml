<p>Even though Debian was started in the U.S. it is an international
project.  Besides many official developers we have a lot of
german speaking contributors who promote Debian GNU in their countries,
provide support for this system or try to help people by translating
our documents and web pages.</p>


<h3>German Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li><a href="$(HOME)/social_contract.de.html">&ldquo;Social Contract&rdquo;
    with the Free Software Community</a></li>
  <li>German user mailing list:
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-german/">web archive</a>,
    <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-user-german">subscribe</a>
  </li>
  <li><a href="http://forum.winner.de/forumdisplay.php?forumid=18">\
    Computer-Forum: Debian</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.debianforum.de/">debianforum.de</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://channel.debian.de/">IRC channel Debian.de</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Translations</h3>

<p> Our goal is to provide the Debian distribution and its
documentation in German as well.  This is helpful for those
people who don't speak English well enough to understand it.  For most
people this is a form of convenience, however for rather old, very
young and less experienced people it is required not to be worried
with english.

<p>There are four big spots where translation is done:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="$(HOME)">website</a>: The most obvious spot and also the
    most advanced one. If you like to help here you can find the information
    for that <a href="#website">below</a>.</li>
  <li>The <a href="http://ddtp.debian.org/">\
    Debian Description Translation Project (DDTP)</a>: This is about the
    translation of the package descriptions which the various package tools
    will present to the user. This is important to help the user to find out
    which packages are interesting or important for them.</li>
  <li>The <a href="$(HOME)/intl/l10n/">central translation page</a>: On this
    page you can find hints about the localisation and internationalisation of
    the packages within Debian aswell as about the debconf templates files.
    This point is also important so the userinteraction of the packages is
    adapted.</li>
  <li>The <a href="$(DOC)/ddp">Debian Documentation Project</a>: This concerns
    additional documentation like various manuals for users, developers and
    others. This documents should also be translated for the benefit of our
    users.</li>
</ul>
