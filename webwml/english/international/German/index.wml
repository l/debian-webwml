<p> Even when Debian was started in the U.S. it is an international
project.  Besides many official developers we have a lot of
contributors from Germany who promote Debian GNU in their country,
provide support for this system or try to help people by translating
our documents and web pages.

<h3>German Support</h3>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract.de.html">&ldquo;Social Contract&rdquo; with the Free Software Community</a>
  <li> German user mailing list, subscribe
    <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-user-german">here</a>
  <li><a href="http://forum.winner.de/forumdisplay.php?forumid=18">\
    Computer-Forum: Debian</a>
  <li><a href="http://www.debianforum.de/">debianforum.de</a>
</ul>

<h3>Translation effort</h3>

<p> Our goal is to provide the Debian distribution and its
documentation in German as well.  This will be helpful for those
people who don't speak English well enough to understand it.  For most
people this is a form of convenience, however for rather old, very
young and less experienced people it is required not to be threatend
with english.
