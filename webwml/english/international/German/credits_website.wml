<h3>Translating www.debian.org</h3>

<p>A lot of people have helped to translate www.debian.org into
German.  This is an important and time-consuming task.  However, once
the German translation is in sync it will be a lot easier since only a
few pages need to be re-synced after somebody has edited the English
original.

<h3>Credits</h3>

<p>Many people have helped with this translation.  However, since it
is a time-consuming task the group probably looks larger than it is in
reality.  Many people don't have time to work on the translation
anymore.  The lists of people are sorted alphabetically.
