* Better separation between the Debian and the upstream part in po files.
  It is needed so that Debian is fully translated without doing the work twice.

  To do that, I'll need to make a script which could be called diff-po


* Support for others materials. For example, for man pages or info manuals. 
  IDEA: Ones would have to add the following comments to translated man page 
    dtc-lang=<ISO code>
    dtc-original=<pseudo-url>
       for example deb://package/path/in/source/package
                or {http|ftp}://url.to.file
                or {http|ftp}://url.to.file#utar/path/in/source
    dtc-version=<version code, see below>
    dtc-translator=(just in case we implement a change-notification-mechanism)
  And in the original page, we only need $Id$ if it's in a CVS anywhere. 
    If not, we need a dtc-version field. Pb: the maintainer have to update it
    manually, what will lead to pbs if (when) not done.

  PB: I'll have to add the original material in DB, too. I can't figure how to 
      do that in one pass on packages. So, some packages may be checked twice.

* Make a FAQ. Some ideas of questions:
  How to translate po ?
  How to translate templates ? 
  (grisu maid a good text at http://auric.debian.org/~grisu/debian_translation/)
  How to give back my work ?
  Links

* Add stable, freeze (when exists), and testing.
  I do not plan to do that when all the material is stored on my home-page in
  school. It's not intended for that, and I don't want stress with the 
  director...

* make update-po when the organization in 'gnu'.

* Add navbar. The new site plan I want is:
  * Stats (this sub tree exists for all versions in stable|[freeze|]testing|unstable)
  | * i18n (better name ?)
  | * l10n
  | | * foreach (po templates) do:
  | | | * big table (split it up?)
  | | | * lang ranking
  | | | | * actual and detailed (the page which exists)
  | | | | * chronological and graphical (the same way 
  | | | | http://master.debian.org/~wakkerma/bugs/ does)
  | | | * package ranking
  | | | | Need a good idea here
  * Material (exists only for both freeze and unstable -- no change allowed for others)
  | * sorted by language
  | | * index
  | | * one for each lang and for each material type (po|templates|...)
  | * sorted by package
  | | * index (?)
  | | * one for each package.
  | | | Contains all material (po|templates), errors encountered...

* Search and fix bugs
* Clean up scripts
* Check the reported errors, and correct the script when there is no error,
  and submit bugs in other cases.

* binary DB
