#use wml::debian::template title="State of l10n in debian -- view per language"

<p>Here is the list of all the languages found in po files and debconf templates in Debian. If
you follow one of these links, you will be give the ability to
download the material for your language. 

<p>You can translate it. But you must first be sure nobody is
currently translating this file, to avoid to do the work twice.

<p>Once you have translated it, you must give it back. If you managed
to be sure you're the only one to work on this file (through a mailing
list, for example), you should know how to give it back. :)<br>
If not, you can file a bug against the package (with severity 'WISHLIST', not higher), 
with the file attached.
