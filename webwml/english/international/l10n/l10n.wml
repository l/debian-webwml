#use wml::debian::template title="Partial status of the l10n in debian"
This stats are very partial : 
<ul>
  <li>it contains only packages based on po files (nls, ie catgets() files are not here).
  <li>It contains only the po files from which the script manage to guess the language
</ul>

<p>The name of packages containing errors are links to the concerned part of the detailed list.</p>

<!-- The next line is the magic to have the big table. Do not change it -->
#include "../../english/international/l10n/scripts/l10n.pl"

The score is equal to (the average l10n)*(nb of packages l10n in this
language).<br> 
It may not be the best note, but it's the one used...
