#use wml::debian::template title="Partial status of the l10n in debian"

This is only a partial list of statistics:
<ul>
  <li>it contains only packages based on po files (nls, ie catgets()
      files are not here).
  <li>It contains only the po files from which the script manages to
      guess the language.
</ul>

<p>The name of packages containing errors are links to the concerned part of the detailed list.</p>

<!-- The next line is the magic to have the big table. Do not change it -->
#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/international/l10n/scripts/l10n.pl"

<p>The score is the percentage of strings translated in all po files.<br> 
It may not be the best statistic, but it's the one used...</p>
