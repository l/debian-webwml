#use wml::debian::template title="Central Debian translation statistics"

<p>These pages show the number of packages in Debian that are ready to be
translated, and how many are actually translated.

<p>Be aware that this process is only a part of internationalization
  (which is abbreviated into <i>i18n</i> because there is 18 letters
  between the i and the n) and localization (or <i>l10n</i>).  i18n
  set up the globalization framework, and l10n add a specific flesh
  for each language and country into this framework. That's why the
  tasks to do for l10n depend on the i18n achieved. For example, if
  your i18n only allows you to change the text of the message, l10n
  only goes about translating these texts. If i18n allows you to
  change the way the date is printed, you may express the way to do
  that in your part of the world. If the i18n allows you to change the
  set of chars used, l10n is only expressing which charset you need
  for a given language.

<p>l10n and i18n are tied, but the difficulties are very different. It's not
  really difficult to allow the program to change the text to display based
  on user settings while it is very time consuming to actually translate
  the messages. On the other hand, setting the charset is trivial, but
  adapting the code to use several charsets is a <i>really hard</i>
  problem.

<p>You can browse some stats about l10n of Debian. You can choose
  between several forms and category:

<ul>
 <li>State of `l10n' in PO files, i.e. how well are the packages translated:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="po/">language list</a>
  <li><a href="po/rank">ranking between languages</a>
  <li><a href="po/todo">packages not i18n'ed</a>
 </ul>
 <li>State of `l10n' in Debconf templates files
 <ul>
  <li><a href="templates/">language list</a>
  <li><a href="templates/rank">ranking between languages</a>
  <li><a href="templates/todo">packages without Debconf support</a>
 </ul>
