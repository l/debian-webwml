#use wml::debian::template title="Translation center of debian"
<p>The purpose of this script generated page is to show how much packages in 
debian are ready to be translated, and how are effectively translated.</p>
<p>Be carefull, this process is only a part of i18n and l10n.
i18n stands for internationalization, and l10n for localisation. to i18n a 
programm is to allow its l10n. And l10n is to do everything so that the 
programm is aware of the specification of each country. It has several parts :
<li>LC_COLLATE : how to sort text
<li>LC_CTYPE : which charset to use
<li>LC_MONETARY : how to represent money
<li>LC_NUMERIC : how to represent numbers
<li>LC_TIME : how to represent the date
<li>LC_MESSAGES : in which language to display the messages
<p>So, you can see that to translate all messages of an application is only a
part of this process. But it's the only part my scripts can monitor. In the 
rest of this pages, I may use i18n or l10n for the LC_MESSAGES part of i18n or
l10n, I know it's wrong, but it's so long to write it right every time...
 Sorry. :)

<p><p>A programm given the ability to be translated when the source was 
modified to be able to use catalogs of translations for its messages. It is 
said translated to a given language when this catalogs have been translated 
to this language.</p>
<p>There is at least two systems of messages catalogs :
<li>nls: use the catgets() and associated functions from Posix
<li>gnu: use the gettext() and associated functions from gnu
<p>I won't go in details between the two solutions. Let me just say that if 
this script can detect programm of the two categories, the support is much 
better for programms using gettext. For example, I don't know how to stat (ie,
see how translated it is) a catgets programm.</p>
<p><br><br><p> Programmer also usely organize their package following a 
standard directory organization. This script detect three of them:
<li>gnu: all the po files are in a directory named "po", and this directory 
also contains all the mechanism to compile it (files named "Makefile.in.in" 
and "POTFILES.in")
<li>nls: all the nls files are in a "nls" directory (ie, there is a "nls dir)
<li>full: all i18n info are stocked in several directory, one per language. 
Each one contains po files, man pages and other related material. (please do 
not flame me because I name this organization "full" :)
<p><br><br><p>Now, you know enought to browse the result of the script. You 
can choose between several forms:</p>
<ul>
 <li>State of 'i18n', ie, which packages are ready to be translated:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="i18n">section by section</a>
 </ul>
 <br><br>
 <li>State of 'l10n', ie how are the packages translated :
 <ul>
  <li><a href="l10n">package by package, in a summarized form</a>
  <li><a href="l10n-packages">package by package, in a detailled form</a>
  <li><a href="l10n-errors">per categories of errors and warnings</a>
  <li><a href="l10n-rank">ranking between languages</a>
 </ul>
</ul>
