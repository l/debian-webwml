#use wml::debian::template title="Central Debian translation statistics"

<p>These pages show the number of packages in Debian that are ready to be
translated, and how many are actually translated.

<p>Be aware that this process is only a part of internationalization
(which is abbreviated into <i>i18n</i> because there is 18 letters
between the "i" and the "n") and localization (or <i>l10n</i>).  i18n
sets up the globalization framework, and l10n adds a specific "flesh"
for each language and country into this framework. That's why the
tasks to do for l10n depend on the achieved i18n. For example, if
your i18n only allows you to change the text of a message, l10n
merely means translating this text. If the i18n allows you to
change the way the date is printed, you may express the way to do
that in your part of the world. If the i18n allows you to change the
set of characters used, l10n is the act of setting the charset you need
for a given language.</p>

<p>l10n and i18n are tied, but the difficulties related to each of them
are very different. It's not
really difficult to allow the program to change the text to display based
on user settings, but it is very time consuming to actually translate
the messages. On the other hand, setting the charset is trivial, but
adapting the code to use several charsets is a <em>really hard</em>
problem.</p>
