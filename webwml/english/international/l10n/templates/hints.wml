<h2>Concepts</h2>
<p>
  In order to keep its translations up to date, an i18n-ed application must
  provide translators an easy way to detect and fix outdated translations.
</p>

<p>
  A Debconf templates file consist of fields and values.  Translated fields
  follow a specific naming scheme, e.g. <code>Description-es</code> stands
  for a Spanish description.  Actually, <code>Description-es_ES</code> (or
  <code>Description-es_MX</code>, or whatever) will be checked first.
</p>

<p>
  Thus to detect outdated translations, one must know from which string
  this description is translated.  The Debconf way is to keep only
  original fields in the templates file, and put translated fields along
  with the corresponding English fields into another file, named
  <code>templates.xx</code> or <code>templates.xx_XX</code> depending on
  language name.  Hints are given below to help working with separate
  files.
</p>

<h2>Initial translation</h2>

<p>
  Before working on a package, please check
  <a href="http://auric.debian.org/~grisu/debian_translation/">Grisu's
  templates translation server</a> and on BTS that no translation has
  already been sent to maintainer.
  Having made sure that, fetch the templates file from
  <a href="./">the language's page</a> or from the above link,
  and then run
</p>
<pre>
   debconf-getlang xx templates &gt; templates.xx
</pre>
<p>
  to generate a file with empty translated fields.
  When ready, check that all strings are translated by running
</p>
<pre>
   debconf-getlang --stats templates templates.xx
</pre>
<p>
  and then send the translated file to the maintainer.
</p>

<h2>Merging translations</h2>

<p>
  As the maintainer did also read this page, he knows that to ease the
  translators' job, he must not merge templates, but keep this file as is in
  the <tt>debian</tt> directory.
</p>

<p>
  The translated templates files are only merged when building the binary
  package.  Debhelper will do this automatically for you if you use the
  <tt>dh_installdebconf</tt> command in your <tt>debian/rules</tt>.
  Otherwise, add a command similar to
</p>
<pre>
	cd debian &amp;&amp; debconf-mergetemplate templates templates.* &gt; tmp/DEBIAN/templates
</pre>

<p>
  So maintainer receives translated templates files and puts them at the right
  place, that's all.
</p>

<h2>Updating translations</h2>
<p>
  Now, initial translation has been integrated, but wording has been
  improved in English templates.  Changes in original templates must be
  incorporated.  Again, <tt>debconf-getlang</tt> does the job for you:
</p>
<pre>
    debconf-getlang xx templates templates.xx &gt; new.xx
</pre>
<p>
  appends <tt>-fuzzy</tt> tag to outdated fields, and insert a blank line
  just above.  Translator then edits <tt>new.xx</tt>, working on outdated
  translations, and checking them with
</p>
<pre>
   debconf-getlang --stats templates new.xx
</pre>
<p>
  that all strings are done.  He then renames <tt>new.xx</tt> into
  <tt>templates.xx</tt> and sends this file to maintainer, which applies
  the same treatment as seen at previous section.
</p>
