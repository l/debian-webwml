#use wml::debian::template title="Errors in translated Debconf templates"
#include "$(ENGLISHDIR)/international/l10n/templates/menu.inc"

<p>
You can find an <a href="errors-by-pkg">alphabetical list of
packages</a> with errors in their translated Debconf templates, or
the same list sorted by <a href="errors-by-maint">maintainers</a>.
</p>

<p>To save space, both lists contain keywords instead of meaningful
messages, which are defined here:</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a name="master">translated-fields-in-master-templates</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Translated templates fields should be kept in separate files in
    order to help translators from being informed when fields are
    outdated.  If translations are put on master templates, they have
    no way to know which fields are outdated.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="unknown">original-fields-removed-in-translated-templates</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Translated templates files should also contain original fields,
    so that translator can check for outdated fields.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="fuzzy">fuzzy-fields-in-templates</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Some fuzzy fields are found into templates files.  Check for *-fuzzy
    fields.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="mismatch">lang-mismatch-in-translated-templates</a></dt>
  <dd>
    A translated templates file has an extension which is different than
    a translated field it contains.  This is certainly a typo, and may
    corrupt other languages.
  </dd>
