Hello, welcome in this part of the Debian web pages. Its purpose is to
make beauty full stats about the localization of the debian packages.

===================
= Commented ls -R =
===================

data/ 
 data/synonyms
   There is a lot of typos in the 'section' fields of packages. This is a list
    of synonyms to fix most of them.
 data/{stable|freeze|testing|unstable}
   These are the DBs (as plain file) of the state of translations in each
     version of Debian.
   They are generated/modified by scripts/transmonitor-check, and used by all
     others scripts.
   FIXME: for now, only unstable exists.
scripts/
 scripts/transmonitor-check 
   The (big) script to maintain the dbs in 'data/'. Ie, to check the current
     state of l10n in Debian
 scripts/utils.pl
   Some subs to read and write the DB file (used in all scripts, including
     transmonitor-check)
 scripts/Language.pm
   Part of the liblocales-perl package. It was easier to include this file here
     to get someone install this package on the right machine.

 scripts/i18n.pl :        \ 
 scripts/l10n-errors.pl :  \
 scripts/l10n-packages.pl : \
 scripts/l10n.pl :           > included by the corresponding .wml to generate the tables
 scripts/l10n-lang.pl       /   on each page
 scripts/l10n-rank.pl      /

 scripts/init.pl
   Included by all .pl which generate a page. Its purpose is to read the DBs.

 scripts/ranking.pl 
   Define some subs which are used to rank the languages.

ChangeLog 
   To track the changes
Makefile
   It's not an easy cut/paste from the standard one, and can be seen as freaky
dl10n.def 
   All slices used by this pages

i18n.wml       \
l10n-lang.wml   \ 
l10n-rank.wml    \
l10n-packages.wml > The "wanna be" pages :)
l10n-errors.wml  / 
index.wml       /
l10n.wml       /

Last but not least : if you "make" this dir, you'll get a lot of l10n-lang-??.html 
file, each one describing a team of translation. They are all generated from 
l10n-lang.wml and l10n-lang.pl

========================================
= What to do to translate this pages ? =
========================================
1. Add the slices for your language to the file dl10n.def 
   (and leave it in the english dir).
2. Translate all the .wml files (and put them in <your language>/international/l10n).

That's all, folks ! You don't need to change any script.
