<h2>General notes for translators.</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
         Before starting a translation, always check with your fellow
         translators on debian-l10n-&lt;<em>language</em>&gt;@lists.debian.org
         (if such a list does exist) to make sure that noone is currently
         working on the same translation, and read current bugreports
         against the package you are going to translate to see if a
         translation has already been reported.
  </li>

  <li>
         If you want to update a translation, please always contact the
         previous translator in order to prevent duplication of work.
         Mail addresses can be found in the PO file.
  </li>

  <li>
         To start a new translation, copy the <tt>templates.pot</tt> file
         into <tt><em>xx</em>.po</tt>, where <em>xx</em> is the
         <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html">ISO
         code</a> of your language.  Then specify in the first
         <tt>msgstr</tt> the charset used for translated strings, and
         also put any useful piece of information.
  </li>
  <li>
         Any general text editor can be used to work on PO files, and
         there are some specific tools like
         <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/text/gtranslator">\
         gtranslator</a> or
         <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/kbabel">\
         kbabel</a> which can be helpful if you are not familiar
         with PO files.
         <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/devel/gettext">\
         Gettext</a>
         <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_toc.html">\
         documentation</a> contains explanations about the PO file format,
         and you must read at least the
         <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_35.html#SEC35">\
         Filling in the Header Entry</a> and
         <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/gettext_9.html#SEC9">\
         The Format of PO Files</a> sections.
  </li>

  <li>
         When you have finished your translation, always reread your
         file at least once to correct all meaning, spelling, grammar,
         typo and other mistakes.  (Maybe your PO editor does include
         a spellchecker or a translation helper like acheck).
         Next run
         <pre>
            msgfmt -c -v -o /dev/null <em>YOUR_LANGUAGE_CODE</em>.po
         </pre>
         to check that your file is valid and will be integrated
         without trouble.
         Depending on your language team policy, you may also send
         your translation to your dedicated l10n list so that it gets
         reviewed.
  </li>

  <li>
         When your translation is finished and valid, file a
         <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">bugreport</a>
         against the package being translated, severity
         <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Developer#severities">wishlist</a>.  Tag
         your report with <tt>l10n</tt> and <tt>patch</tt>
         <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Developer#tags">marks</a>,
         add <tt><protect>[INTL:</protect><em>xx</em>]</tt> (where
         <em>xx</em> is the
         <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/langcodes.html">ISO
         code</a> of your language) to the subject to help further
         searches, ask politely that your translation gets included,
         give maintainer instructions on what to do with this file (e.g.
         <strong>Please copy the attachment into debian/po/cs.po</strong>) and do
         not forget to attach your translation.  This step can be very
         easily performed with the
         <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/utils/reportbug">\
         reportbug</a> utility.

<h2>Notes specific to po-debconf</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
         The field name is displayed in comments before <tt>msgid</tt>.
         <tt>Default</tt> values are special for debconf, because when
         template type is <tt>Select</tt> or <tt>Multiselect</tt>, they
         must <strong>not</strong> be translated, but their values may
         be changed (in rare circumstances) to another string listed in
         the English <tt>Choices</tt> field.  For this reason,
         developers should use <tt>DefaultChoice</tt> instead of
         <tt>Default</tt> in order to prevent confusion.
         <strong>This is a po-debconf extension.</strong>
         In the generated templates file, <tt>Default</tt> will of course be
         printed, since debconf does not define this <tt>DefaultChoice</tt>
         field.
  </li>

  <li>
         Because instructions for translators may be inserted by
         developers, you must ensure that the tool you are using
         is able to display (without corruption) these comments.
         See for instance instructions to handle language selection
         in the
         <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/geneweb">\
         geneweb</a> package.
  </li>

  <li>
         Sometimes msgids are identical whereas msgstr could have
         different values.  In order to make msgids unique, some
         special text can be inserted at the end of the string, more
         precisely any sequence of
         <ul>
             <li>a left square bracket: <tt>[</tt></li>
             <li>a space</li>
             <li>zero or more occurrences of any character except left
             square bracket, right square bracket and newline</li>
             <li>a right square bracket: <tt>]</tt></li>
         </ul>
         at the end of string is removed from <tt>msgid</tt> strings.
         It also applies to <tt>msgstr</tt> strings, so that translators can
         insert an empty string.
  </li>

  <li>
         Lines are wrapped by debconf, except when they begin with a
         space.  Such lines are often used to format lists, but each
         frontend has its own limitations.  It seems that such lines
         must not exceed 72 characters in order to be displayed
         reasonably well on all frontends.
  </li>

  <li>
         The <tt>podebconf-display-po</tt> script (from po-debconf &gt;= 0.8.3)
         is able to show your translation as it will be displayed by
         debconf at configuration time.  Run
         <pre>
            podebconf-display-po -fdialog debian/po/<em>YOUR_LANG_CODE</em>.po
         </pre>
         to have a rough idea on how your translation will look like.
         But this only works for basic configuration files, rendering
         may be altered if complex operations (like heavy use of text
         substitution) are performed.  Available debconf frontends
         (which can be selected by the <tt>-f</tt> flag) are listed in
         debconf(7).
  </li>
