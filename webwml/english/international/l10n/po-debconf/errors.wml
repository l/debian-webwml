<p>
You can find an <a href="errors-by-pkg">alphabetical list of
packages</a> with errors in their translated Debconf templates, or
the same list sorted by <a href="errors-by-maint">maintainers</a>.
</p>

<p>
In order to save room, both lists contain keywords instead of meaningful
messages, which are defined here. Some of these errors should be fixed
by the translators, while others should be fixed by the maintainer.

<h3>Errors which are the responsibility of the translators</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a name="charsetname">invalid-charset-name-in-po</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Po files must have a valid charset in the Content-Type: field of
    the header. The charset is the choice of the translators and the po
    file should be fixed by the translators themself, unless the maintainers
    are absolutely sure of what they are doing.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="charset">wrong-charset</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The charset specified in the Content-Type: field of the po header
    is not the same as the one used in the po file. The charset is the
    choice of the translators and the po file should be fixed by the
    translators themself, unless the maintainers are absolutely sure of what
    they are doing. These files are not at all usable, the maintainers
    should therefore ask the translators for fixed files.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="invalidpo">invalid-po</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The po file is not valid. The reasons can be numerous. The output
    of msgfmt should help the translators to fix their files.
    These files are not at all usable, the maintainers
    should therefore ask the translators for fixed files.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Errors which are the responsibility of the maintainers</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><a name="unknownlanguage">unknown-language</a></dt>
  <dd>
    A po file has an unknown language code. The basename of the file should
    be a valid language code. The headers should help to find
    which language it refers, otherwise it is pointless to include it in
    a package as nobody will use them.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="missingfile">missing-file-in-POTFILES.in</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The debian/po/POTFILES.in refers to unexisting templates files.
    This error is often found after renaming or removing
    templates files. This is the responsibility of the maintainers to
    fix this file, to update the po files and to ask for updated
    translations. The translators should <strong>not</strong> work on
    these packages, as the templates.pot file is usually completly
    out of date.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="template">not-up-to-date-templates.pot</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The debian/po/templates.pot has not been synced with the
    templates files. The maintainers should fix their packages
    by adding debconf-updatepo to the clean target of the
    debian/rules. The translators should first launch
    debconf-updatepo if they work with the source package. The
    po and pot files on the website should be up to date.
  </dd>
  <dt><a name="po">not-up-to-date-po-file</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The listed files have not been synced with the templates. The
    maintainers should fix their packages by adding debconf-updatepo to
    the clean target of the debian/rules. The translators should first
    launch debconf-updatepo if they work with the source package. The
    po files on the website should be up to date.
  </dd>
