<H3>What is the Partners Program?</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <p>The Partners Program was created to recognize companies and organizations 
    that are providing ongoing assistance to Debian. Because of the substantial 
    support provided by these partners, we have been able to expand and improve 
    Debian. We would like to officially recognize their efforts, and continue 
    to maintain a good working relationship.</p>
