<H3>What is the Partners Program?</H3>

 This program provides a way to recognize companies and projects
 that provide ongoing assistance to the Debian project.
 Since these partners are providing a
 service of some sort to Debian, we will officially recognize them and
 maintain a good working relationship with them.

<p>
For more information, please read the Debian Partners Program
