#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Partners Program - New Partner Proposal"

<blockquote> 
    
  <p>The success of Debian has been due to the people and
  organizations, who support the many Debian projects. We believe that
  our Partners play a crucial role in the continued development of
  Debian and related applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;Debian partners have provided
  substantial assistance to the cooperative development, availability,
  and day to day support of our world wide presence.</p>

  <p>If you would like to become an actively contributing part
  of the Debian community, and feel that you can contribute expertise
  and resources to helping Debian, please take a moment to tell us a
  bit about your company and your ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us know how your organization 
  could not only contribute to Debian, but how a continued relationship might
  benefit your organization.</p>

  <p>You may either use the form below, or email your proposal to
  <A HREF="mailto:partners@debian.org">partners@debian.org</A>.
  &nbsp;&nbsp;We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
