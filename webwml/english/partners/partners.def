   <a href="https://www.leaseweb.com/">LeaseWeb</a> has been one of two 
   partners that provide the infrastructure for the 
   <a href="https://snapshot.debian.org">Debian OS Snapshot Archive</a> since 
   <a href="https://www.debian.org/News/2014/20141014">October 2014</a>, 
   providing 80 Terabytes (TB) of capacity. In 2017 they renewed their support 
   by provisioning two additional dedicated servers 
   that expanded the storage at their location by 50%, 
   enough to accommodate anticipated growth for years to come.
