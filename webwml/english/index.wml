<H2>What is Debian?</H2>

<P><A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> is a
<A href="intro/free">free</A> operating system (OS) for your computer.
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run. Debian uses the <A HREF="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</A>
kernel (the core of an operating system), but most of the basic OS tools
come from the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</A>; hence the name
GNU/Linux.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over
<packages_in_stable> <A HREF="distrib/packages">packages</A>, precompiled software bundled
up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine.
