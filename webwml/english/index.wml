<H2>What is Debian?</H2>

<P><A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> is a
<A href="intro/free">free, or Open Source</A>, operating system
(OS) for your computer.  An operating system is the set of basic programs
and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating
system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the
computer, does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.
Debian is kernel independent.  It currently uses the 
<A href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A> kernel but work is
in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, using 
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html"> the Hurd</A>.

#<H2>Debian and Y2K Compliance</H2>
<P>Debian passed into the year 2000 with flying colors. Of the more than
4000 packages in Debian less than 10 had problems and none of them
affected the usability of the program. The only commonly used programs
affected were emacs and groff.
The <A href="y2k/">Debian Y2K page</A> will be available for a few months
and lists the packages that had problems. An update of Debian 2.1 will
be released shortly which includes fixes for all the affected packages.
