<H2>What is Debian?</H2>

<P><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> is a
<a href="intro/free">free, or Open Source</A>, operating system
(OS) for your computer.  An operating system is the set of basic programs
and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating
system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the
computer, does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other
programs. Debian uses the <a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A>
kernel, a free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and
supported by (probably over 1000) programmers worldwide. A large part of
the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A>, which are also free. Of course, the
thing that people want is software; tools to help them get what they want
to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games
to writing more software.  Debian comes with over 1500 packages
(precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on
your machine) &mdash; all of it <a href="intro/free">free</A>.
