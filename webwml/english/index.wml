<h2>What is Debian?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a
<a href="intro/free">free</a> operating system (OS) for your computer.
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run. Debian uses the <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
kernel (the core of an operating system), but most of the basic OS tools
come from the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</a>; hence the name
GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>Debian GNU/Linux provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over
<packages_in_stable> <a href="distrib/packages">packages</a>, precompiled software bundled
up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine.</p>
