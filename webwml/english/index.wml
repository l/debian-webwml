<H2>What is Debian?</H2>

<P><A href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</A> is a
<A href="intro/free">free, or Open Source</A>, operating system
(OS) for your computer.  An operating system is the set of basic programs
and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating
system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the
computer, does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.
Debian is kernel independent.  It currently uses the 
<A href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A> kernel but work is
in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, using 
<A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</A>.

<P>Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds
and supported by (probably over 1000) programmers worldwide.

<P>Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as
Mach) to implement different features.  Hurd is free software produced by the
GNU project.

<P>A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come
from the <A href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU project</A>; hence the names: 
GNU/Linux and GNU/Hurd .  These tools are also free. Of course,
what people want is application software: programs to help them get what
they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to
playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 2250
packages (precompiled software bundled up in a nice format for easy
installation and upgrade on your machine) &mdash; all of it 
<A href="intro/free">free</A>.
