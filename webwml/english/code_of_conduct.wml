  Version 1.0 ratified on April 28th, 2014.
</p>

<p>The Debian Project, the producers of the Debian system, have adopted a code
of conduct for participants to its mailinglists, IRC channels and other modes
of communication within the project.</p>


<hr />
    <h2>Debian <q>Code of Conduct</q></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<strong>Be respectful</strong>
	<p>
    In a project the size of Debian, inevitably there will be people with
    whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that,
    but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor
    behaviour or personal attacks, and a community in which people feel
    threatened is not a healthy community.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Assume good faith</strong>
	<p>
    Debian Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goal of a
    <a href="$(HOME)/intro/free">free</a> operating system which
    may differ from your ways. Assume that other people are working towards
    this goal.
	</p><p>
    Note that many of our Contributors are not native English speakers or
    may have different cultural backgrounds.
    </p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Be collaborative</strong>
	<p>
    Debian is a large and complex project; there is always more to learn
    within Debian. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Similarly,
    offers for help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of
    improving Debian.
    </p><p>
    When you make something for the benefit of the project, be willing to
    explain to others how it works, so that they can build on your work to
    make it even better.
	</p>
      </li>
	<p>
    Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of
    persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the
    conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is
    necessary, consider adding a summary.
    </p><p>
    Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each mail adds
    something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the
    thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have
    already been made.
    </p><p>
    Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly
    large.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Be open</strong>
	<p>
    Most ways of communication used within Debian allow for public and
    private communication. As per paragraph three of the <a
    href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social contract</a>, you should preferably
    use public methods of communication for Debian-related messages, unless
    posting something sensitive.
    </p><p>
    This applies to messages for help or Debian-related support, too; not
    only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer
    to your question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made
    by people answering your question will be more easily detected and
    corrected.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>In case of problems</strong>
      <p>While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
      recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
      some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may
      reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be
      in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However,
      regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
      adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it
      should not be abusive or disrespectful. Assume good faith; it is more
      likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that
      they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.
      </p><p>
      Serious or persistent offenders will be temporarily or permanently banned
      from communicating through Debian's systems. Complaints should be made
      (in private) to the administrators of the Debian communication forum in
      question. To find contact information for these administrators, please
      see <a href="$(HOME)/intro/organization">the page on Debian's
      organizational structure</a>.

     <p>Some of the links in this section do not refer to documents that are
     part of this code of conduct, nor are they authoritative within Debian.
     However, they all do contain useful information on how to conduct
     oneself on our communication channels.

<p><em>Updates to this code of conduct should follow the normal GR procedure.

documents in the "Further reading" section after consultation with the project
and without requiring a GR.</em></p>
