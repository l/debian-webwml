#use wml::debian::template title="Platforms for Raphaël Hertzog" BARETITLE="true"

<h2>Presentation</h2>

<p>My name is Raphaël Hertzog. I'm known as <i>buxy</i> on IRC. I'm a 23 year
old french student. The school where I study is called 
"<a href="http://www.insa-lyon.fr">INSA de Lyon</a>" and I'm part of 
the <a href="http://www.if.insa-lyon.fr/if/">computer science department</a>. 
I'll have my engineer degree this summer after which
I'll be looking for a job related to free software (which hopefully will
leave me much time for Debian work). 

<h2>History within Debian</h2>

<p>My first contact with Linux was with Debian 1.3. It dates back
to 1997. I first tried Debian because someone told me it had perl
installed by default and because I had discovered perl on Windows a few
months before and had thought that it was really cool. However I quickly
erased my Debian partition in order to try other distributions (Red Hat
mainly). I came back to Debian a few months later for two main reasons:
it was used by the most competent people I knew within my LUG, and 
I understood that it was the only distribution where I could actually
help and get involved.

<p>In 1998, I joined Debian as a developer and started with a single package
called "<a href="http://packages.debian.org/sympa">sympa</a>". It wasn't
even DFSG free (it had a clause against commercial use) however the
license has been corrected after discussion with the upstream authors.

<p>I quickly got interested by the Debian Quality Assurance work which was
still managed by Vincent Renardias. He initiated me to it. I started to
look for packages that I could work on with my perl skills, and I found
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/dpkg-ftp">dpkg-ftp</a> (the ftp method
of dselect). I took it over since it was in a really bad shape and fixed
all known bugs including the wishlist ones.

<p>In 1999, the debian-cd team had a problem because the script was not
really designed to manage multiple CDs and slink was the first Debian
version which needed more than a single CD. That's why I wrote YACS (Yet
Another Cd Script) (however I used parts of the slink_cd code from Steve
McIntyre) which became the official debian-cd for the potato release. It
featured a better design able to handle efficiently multiple CDs and
custom CDs (you can easily customize the content of the CDs). I'm still
the maintainer of debian-cd.

<p>Also in 1999, we had big troubles with the new maintainer team. It closed
the doors for various reasons. I didn't agree with that decision. That's
why I launched the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1999/debian-devel-199907/msg01530.html">sponsorship
mechanism</a>. The principle is simple: each prospective maintainer has to
find an official Debian developer who will check his work and who will
upload his package into Debian. Of course, the Debian developer shares his
remarks about the package with the prospective maintainer so that he can
learn from it. And because of that the sponsorship system survived even
after the reopening of the new maintainer door. It appeared to be a great
tool to train the future developers and to make sure that they share our
principles (Social Contract, DFSG).

<p>Still in 1999 (I didn't remember that I did so many things in the same
year ! :-)), I helped Darren Stalder to make perl-5.005 ready and I managed
the whole perl migration (all binary modules had to be recompiled,
I contacted everyone who was concerned and I NMUed packages which had not
been updated in time). At the same time I wrote the first version of the
<a href="$(HOME)/doc/packaging-manuals/perl-policy/">perl
policy</a>.

<p>After that, I worked to resurrect Debian QA. I launched <a
href="http://qa.debian.org">qa.debian.org</a> (it still exists but the
content has been completely updated since then by the good work
of several other QA workers like Josip Rodin and Martin Michlmayr)
and I created the QA committee. The committee doesn't exist anymore
because it didn't work. It was a try to "organize" QA with a team
deciding what has to be done and with workers who do the real work.
My interpretation of this failure is that it was too centralized for
Debian and that it didn't match Debian's way of doing, and thus it failed.

<p>Nowadays, I'm convinced that to keep up with the tremendous work and to
keep its high quality, Debian has to adapt itself to prevent problems 
(packages badly maintained, packages forgotten and
not orphaned, ...) from happening. That's why I launched the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2002/debian-devel-announce-200201/msg00011.html">Package
Tracking System</a> with the help from Anthony Towns.
The main idea behind the PTS is that we should have more people taking care
of each package. Taking care can mean several things from helping the
maintainer (for another developer) to just watching that the package is
well maintained (for an advanced user that cares about that particular
package). 

<p>And during all the time, I followed many mailing lists and participated
in dozens of discussions (and flames, even if I tend to skip them since you
usually just loose time with them). I also sponsored many future
maintainers and participated in several bug squash parties. And of course,
I did my usual maintainer work: I'm maintaining 5 perl modules, dpkg-ftp,
debian-cd and logidee-tools.

<p>With all this experience I believe to be quite familiar with Debian and
its way of working. I have been in contact with many people involved in all
the key aspects concerning Debian (boot-floppies, ftpmasters, release
manager, BTS maintainers, security team, QA team, debian-www team, 
debian-admin, porters and buildd maintainers ...).

<h2>The role of the leader</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the main tasks of the leader are "organization" and
"communication". 
<p>The organization part concerns the inner working of Debian, he has to
make sure that the Debian's infrastructure is adapted for the Debian work.
If necessary, he should initiate projects to resolve the problems. If
you want to know what kind of "infrastructure" I'm speaking about, take a
look at my <a href="#projects">program</a>.
<p>The communication part can be split in two categories : internal
and external. The leader has to be in contact with as many people as
possible in Debian and has to make sure that everyone is going in the same
direction. The leader also represents Debian in the "outside" world, he
responds to interviews, participates in shows and so on.
<p>However it's not always possible to go everywhere you're invited and
thus I'm thinking about the possibility to appoint local representatives
of the leader (volunteers of course).
<p>In short, the leader has to make sure the Debian work can be done in good
conditions and that everyone involved is having fun and can be proud of
what he did ...

<h1 align="center"><a name="projects">Projects for Debian</a></h1>

<p>My program contains so many items that I can't guarantee that
they will all be completed. However I'll do everything possible to see
as many of them through the end. Each project will be assigned a
responsible person (candidates are encouraged to contact me) who should
keep me informed of their progress. I'll periodically publish messages
explaining where each of the projects are and what their status is.

<p>Here's the list of all the projects I'd like to manage
during the next year. They are classified in 2 categories:
<ul>
<li><a href="#organisation">1. Organisation</a>

<li><a href="#sf">1.1 Sourceforge for Debian developers</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<hr width="100%" align="center">
<h2><a name="organisation">1. Organisation</a></h2>

<h3><a name="sf">1.1 Sourceforge for Debian developers</a></h3>
<p>Creating a sourceforge.debian.org to let Debian developers host their
own free software projects is a good idea for several reasons :
<ul>
<li>The traditional mailing list and CVS services provided by Debian
    are only used for projects of general interest to Debian.
    Developers can't request a mailing list or CVS repository for a project
    not directly related to Debian (in particular if it concerns only a 
    few people). Here the sourceforge tool would let each developer
    have a mailing list or CVS repository (along with all the sourceforge services)
    for his projects;</li> 
<li>All the projects hosted on sourceforge.debian.org would be identified
    as coming from the Debian community and it would make us more visible
    as an active part of the free software community;</li>
<li>Sourceforge is a good way to launch projects that we want to
    spread further than Debian alone. I'll take the menu system
    as an example, it has been developed by Debian originally, but
    it's not really Debian specific (Mandrake is reusing it) but
    if it would have been somewhere where non-Debian people
    can easily help, maybe it would be used by even more people
    now;</li>
<li>SourceForge can be a great tool to let non developers
    work on certain parts of Debian. Think about the documentation and
    the numerous translators.
</ul>
<p>Of course, the projects hosted on sourceforge.debian.org would not
need to be Debian specific. The only criteria would be that the project
must be requested by a Debian developer.

<cite>
As you may know, I have been part of the Debian-QA effort for quite
some time and as such, I'd like to make it more popular and more
effective. While I have no miraculous solution (we can advertise it a bit
more, but that's part of the "communication" projects), I have some new
tasks for it:
</cite>

<h3><a name="ping">1.2 Ping the maintainers</a></h3>
This idea always comes up again and again, but nobody really did it.
Martin Michlmayr started something for tracking MIA maintainers but he
doesn't contact everybody, just people who have been detected as MIA
by someone else (who noticed a huge bug list without any answer and so on).
It's time that we do it effectively by contacting all maintainers 
who either have packages in bad shape or have disappeared (according
to echelon's information):
<ul>
<li>we can detect MIA maintainers and orphan the corresponding packages ;</li>
<li>we can inform the maintainers of the state of their packages and make
    them realize that they should find some help or orphan some packages
    if they are in bad shape;</li>
<li>maintainers who forget they were Debian developers may wish to retire
    (I'd prefer them to get back to work, but if they don't plan to come back
    to Debian, then they should retire so that we can reduce the risks of
    their key getting hacked);</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="adoption">1.3 Recruit people for adopting packages</a></h3>
<p>As you know, we have a growing number of orphaned packages and many more
packages that aren't orphaned but really should be (since they are not
well maintained). We have two solutions with orphaned packages; either we
remove them or we find a new maintainer. Removing packages is already done
from time to time by the QA team. But nobody is really trying to find
new maintainers. Making the list of orphaned package available on the web
is not enough (it's a pain to read through it anyway).
<p>We have to build a team which will take contacts with the (past and current)
maintainer(s), past contributors that can be found on the BTS, upstream
authors and mailing lists specialized on that package. The goal is to find
a new maintainer and several motivated persons that would subscribe to the
PTS to help clean (and maintain) the package. If we can't find an actual
Debian developer, the team would have to find a sponsor until one of the
interested people become an official developer.
<p>Maintainers could also request the help of this team to find "backup
maintainers" and/or contributors to help in the management of their
package.
<p>All this work can be coordinated through a new "virtual package" in
the BTS (much like "wnpp", I have no idea for a name however).

<hr width="75%" align="center">
<cite>
Being French, i'm quite aware of localisation (and internationalisation)
issues. We still have much work left until we reach full internationalisation.
I believe that we need a better infrastructure to coordinate between
translators, proofreaders and developers. The DDTP of Michael Bramer is
a first step in this direction even if it generated lots of flames
on debian-devel...
</cite>

<h3><a name="l10n">1.4 Localization infrastructure</a></h3>
I don't have a precise idea yet on how it should be setup. However we know the
problems we have to manage:
<ul>
<li>We have to translate at least (and keep up to date) the debconf
    templates, the packages' descriptions and the Debian specific program
    (messages and documentation). Going further would imply coordination
    with people who are working on free software outside of Debian; it would
    be interesting, but we should first focus on what is directly Debian
    related.
<li>We need an effective way to distribute the work of translating. For
    that the DDTP is a great step I think.</li>
<li>We have to make sure that translations which are sent to the BTS
    actually get included. Too many of them are still lying in the BTS
    even if it's fairly easy to include them.</li>
</ul>
You can also look at <a href="$(HOME)/intl/l10n/">Debian
translation statistics</a> to learn more about the localisation process
and to see the kind of information that the new infrastructure should
provide (in real time).

<hr width="75%" align="center">
<cite>
After years of good reports, Debian recently had some bad publicity about
how it managed the security alerts. I'd like to have some improvements.
</cite>

<h3><a name="security">1.5 A second security team</a></h3>
<p>We can create a second security team which would have access to the same
information than the main one and which would have access to the same tools
(rbuilder, ...). The main goal of this second team would be
to provide updated packages for the non-stable distributions. They can
also punctually help the main team by providing packages ready
that just have to be checked (by the main team). 
<p>This second team actually coordinates with the maintainer to get a
fix quickly into unstable. They also provide a package for "testing" (or
any other distribution we may introduce...) by backporting the patch
if necessary. This fixed package may be directly put in testing or
it may simply be provided on security.debian.org/testing until a fixed
package has gotten its way into testing.
<p>This second team does more or less 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2001/debian-security-200109/msg00225.html">already exist</a>,
but it hasn't been very effective yet. It needs to be extended (two people
isn't enough) and it needs to work on setting up the required
infrastructure (we don't yet have rbuilders for all the architectures).

<hr width="75%" align="center">
<cite>
You all know that we have serious issues with release
management. Anthony Towns is not to blame, he has done a great job so far,
but we need to go a step further. I have some proposals but they all need to
be discussed/amended. However it's not yet time to discuss them... it's
just to let you know that I plan to work on improving the release management
because the current situation is not acceptable in the long run. This
is all stuff for woody+1 of course, Anthony will continue to manage
woody's release and I'll support him as much as needed !
</cite>

<h3><a name="release1">1.6 Don't mix stable and unstable packages</a></h3>
We have several problems with the current situation:
<ul>
<li>testing is derived from unstable which consistently gets new versions
    of all packages (and new bugs at the same time);</li>
<li>when we must provide an updated package for testing, we have to go through
    unstable again. It means that the package may be recompiled against a
    newer version of a library (which was not yet available
    when the previous version of the package had been uploaded) which may
    hold it within unstable (because that library may have problems or
    other conflicts);</li>
<li>when we are working on unstable packages we can't hold them in
    unstable without filing a release critical bug on that purpose.
    Think about GNOME 2 prerelease packages. They should never appear
    in "testing" which is going to be our next "stable". The same
    applies for XFree 4.2, Branden is not going to upload it to
    unstable because that would mean that he can't provide updated
    version of XFree 4.1 for testing ...</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why I think that we need to have completely separate
distribution for the next stable in preparation and unstable. It's up to the
maintainer to decide when his package is ready to be included in the
distribution in preparation.
<p>For the rest of my explanation, I'll call "working" the distribution
in preparation to which the maintainer decides to upload packages that he
believes to be mostly ready to be included in a "stable" distribution.
<p>People still work in unstable, but when the package is ready in
unstable, it is uploaded to working and not before ! Any package uploaded
to working is compiled against working.
<p>That would let (for example) Branden upload xfree 4.2.0 into unstable
while still finalizing xfree 4.1 into working. Or, Gnome 2.0 can easily
be prepared in unstable and keep gnome 1.4 in "working" without having
to worry. Once a package (or a set of packages) is ready in unstable, we
may have a script pushing it into working and all autobuilders (including
the i386 one) will pick it and build it. That way we may prevent some
unnecessary source uploads which may introduce bugs.
<p>One of the consequences is that we should have autobuilders building
for "working" as well as for "unstable". That means we'll need more
autobuilders and more build chroots ... but it's a required step to ease
the release manager work: each maintainer decides if his packages
are suitable for stable. Once uploaded to working, the release manager of
course still has the possibility to control what he accepts.
<p>And what about testing ? Well, we essentially keep it like it is.
Because it's great for some of our advanced users and it's a good way to
see if a package is a good candidate for "working" or not. And we
introduce "releasable" which consists of the result of the "testing
scripts" run against "working". "releasable" would be a consistent
distribution based on working packages. That is, it shouldn't be far from
being ready to release ...
<p align="center"><img src="http://people.debian.org/~hertzog/release-management.png" alt="Release management" width="465" height="251">

<h3><a name="release2">1.7 Freeze standard ("Debian core packages") regularly</a></h3>

<p>Since the "working" distribution is only made of packages considered
as good by their maintainer, the base/standard system contained in
"working" should always be mostly ready and can be frozen regularly
(every 8 months) without requiring more than a few weeks of work. At this
moment, we have a period of one or two months, after which the new
stable distribution will be made (whatever happens ... packages not ready
at this time will simply be dropped).

<p>This completely ignores boot-floppies, because I assume that they
should always be ready (if the new version is not ready, then the old one
should still be usable). 

<hr width="75%" align="center">
<cite>
Last but not least, we have to go further for collaborative maintenance of
packages. I have two ideas in mind:
</cite>

<h3><a name="pts">1.8 Extension for the Package Tracking System (PTS)</a></h3>

<p>I implemented (with the help of Anthony Towns for the BTS modifications)
the Package Tracking System. But it could be extended with a web interface;
each source package would have its own web page (with a URL like
http://activity.debian.org/&lt;sourcepackage&gt;). This page would aim to
be a portal for the source package. It would include many links (to the
BTS, to the lintian pages, to packages.debian.org) and some more
information (like the information provided by madison on auric). It would
also have a news like system where people can add news simply by mailing
&lt;sourcepackage&gt;@activity.debian.org, which would be directly
available on the web. Here's the kind of news which could be interesting:
<ul>
<li>New beta packages available for tests</li>
<li>Expect final version of the package for 2002-02-15 (to allow the
    translators to update their translations, for example)</li>
<li>Packaging is in the process of being redone</li>
<li>Version X.Y-Z is screwed, how to fix</li>
<li>NMU being worked on by Henri Dupont</li>
<li>Maintainer on vacation until 2002-02-12 (if the maintainer wants to
publish this information ... it wouldn't be required, of course)</li>
<li>New upstream source available, packaging plans</li>
<li>Bug squashing party on this package next week</li>
</ul>
<p>The maintainer may also add some static information to that page, like how
he'd like the NMUs to be done, or what other useful resources are
available for that package (upstream bug tracking system, irc channels,
mailing lists...).
<p>This extension should let many more people rapidly jump in and
know the essential information about the package. QA workers can check what is
going on with the package, and at freeze time it can be an invaluable
tool to indicate that a QA worker is going to take care of this
package.

<h3><a name="cvs">1.9 CVS repository for debian directories</a></h3>
<p>Another natural step when more people are going to work on the same
package is to put the debian/* files under CVS control. We need to
provide some disk space on our CVS server for that purpose. We need a
tool to automatically create such a repository (i.e. each maintainer
could require a CVS repository for its own package by calling a
program on the good server). The integration with the packaging tools
should be a bit studied and helper tools should be provided
(to update, commit, manage branches (stable/unstable) and tag files
when a package is uploaded and so on). cvs-buildpackage might be used
for that purpose.
<p>Suppose that all Debian developers have write access on all
those cvs repositories, the advantages are numerous and the main
maintainer can still have some control:
<ul>
<li>The translation team could directly commit the translations
    without requiring work from the maintainer;</li>
<li>NMUers would no more need to send a patch to the BTS. The patch
    is directly applied to CVS; the maintainer can revert it
    or keep it;</li>
<li>It's far easier for the maintainer to have co-maintainers, he doesn't
    have to "centralize" patches. He just needs to update its local
    repository from time to time;</li>
<li>We can easily maintain two version of the packages (stable and
    unstable for example) using CVS branches;</li>
<li>The maintainer(s) can have a mail for each commit with the
    patch and the log attached. With such a system he can see who
    did what, and detect potential mistakes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this service would be optional, maintainers wouldn't be
forced to use it.


<!-- ##### -->
<hr width="100%" align="center">
<h2><a name="communication">2. Communication</a></h2>

First of all, our internal communication needs to be improved. Some
useful things are only known by the maintainers who follow either
debian-devel or #debian-devel. That's not really acceptable. If there
are things that are of interest to all developers we should document
them (and announce them on debian-devel-announce).

<h3><a name="dbpp">2.1 Debian Best Packaging Practices</a></h3>

<p>The first time I heard of this was on IRC; it was an idea from Matthew
Wilcox. Since I really liked the principle of this idea, I have included
it in my program.
<p>The DBPP is going to be a manual referencing all the best solutions
available for maintaining a package: use DBS if you have to manage several
upstream patches, use debconf for user interaction, how to handle
config files that you want to auto-generate and so on. We have accumulated
years of experience that we must capitalize upon.

<h3><a name="ddr">2.2 Updated Debian Developer's Reference</a></h3>
<p>The Debian Developers' Reference is already an invaluable documentation
   for the maintainers, but we have to keep it up to date with respect
   to the resources available (document the PTS for example, and all other
   projects completed and mentioned in the first part of my program).
<p>Furthermore it should also give a list of things that a developer
   can (or should) do apart from maintaining his own package(s)
   (i.e. quality assurance, sponsorship, application management,
   working on the installer, participating in bug squashing parties, ...).
<p>It could also benefit from more translations.

<h3><a name="backup">2.3 Promote the idea of collaborative maintenance and backup maintainers</a></h3>
<p>The idea of collaborative maintenance is not very widely spread within
   Debian. Only a few packages are managed by a full team. This has to
   change. We have to explain how useful it is to be several maintainers
   for each package. We have to document all the resources available
   for the co-maintenance (PTS, Uploaders field, CVS, ...).
<p>For smaller packages, where several maintainers are not really needed,
   it's still useful to have "backup maintainers", who can help
   punctually like when the maintainer is on vacation (or when he's really
   busy). And since they'd follow the package, they'll prevent
   the package from being forgotten in the limbo ... :-)

<h3><a name="dd-local">2.4 Create more debian-devel-&lt;language&gt; lists</a></h3>
<p>I created debian-devel-french a few months ago and it would
   be interesting to have more dedicated list like this one (we also
   already have debian-devel-spanish) for each major language (I have no
   criteria for defining "major language"). Such lists are useful, because
   maintainers who don't follow debian-devel may follow the local
   counterpart which usually has much less traffic.  If good ideas come up
   on the local list, they'll always be forwarded by a maintainer who's
   following both lists. The contrary happens too; some things discussed
   on debian-devel also get discussed on the local list. The list also
   serves the purpose of debian-mentors but in one's native tongue (it's
   much friendlier and much easier to find a sponsor in this context).

<hr width="75%" align="center">
<cite>
Despite Debian's openness, we aren't much trying to communicate with people
outside of Debian; we just let them find themselves on the website what
they want to know. We should be more active, we must try to tell them what
we want them to know.
</cite>

<h3><a name="message">2.5 A message adapted for each population</a></h3>

We certainly have many things to say to everyone. However 
we have to adapt our message for each population. Exactly what we are going
to tell them is what Debian can offer to them and what Debian needs that
they may provide. Here's the list of people concerned and examples of
messages (the list may be discussed and extended of course):

<ul>

<li>An average user
<ul>
<li>How to get Debian (CD vendors) and its derivative distributions</li>
<li>Where he can find Debian support (community or commercial)</li>
<li>How to donate (money or hardware) to Debian</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A contributor (an advanced user)
<ul>
<li>How to track Debian's development (testing, mailing lists, PTS, ...)</li>
<li>How to report bugs and how to follow them</li>
<li>How to help without being developer (translations, patches,
    feedback, quality assurance in general...)</li>
<li>How to get a developer for further involvement</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>A linux user group
<ul>
<li>Where to find stuff for install-parties, demonstrations, expositions
    (posters, documentation, logos, cool background images, explanation
    of Debian's advantages, ...)</li>
<li>Support beginners who discover Debian through their
    local mailing lists</li>
<li>Offer facilities for Debian users (local mirror, sell Debian CDs, ...)</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h3><a name="upstream">2.6 Get in touch with upstream developers</a></h3>
<p>I have the feeling that too few maintainers have real contacts
   with the upstream authors. This should change, we should have
   better contact with them and we should even try to recruit
   the upstream developers who are already using Debian. We should
   inform them of how they can help (without going through the
   hassle of getting Debian's developer) by subscribing to their
   packages with the Package Tracking System and by taking into
   account the bug reports that are forwarded.
<p>The better the upstream authors know Debian, the better the
   cooperation will be. That's why I'd like us to write a kind
   of "open letter to the free software authors" (which could be
   inspired by the page described in the previous point) that
   each maintainer should forward to the upstream developers
   of his packages.

<h3><a name="bizcases">2.7 Promote Debian in the business</a></h3>
<p>While Debian isn't a commercial distribution, it is meant to
be used everywhere including in corporate and commercial environment.
Debian's development in that area should be encouraged because
the more companies know about Debian, the more donations we can have, and
the more developers can get paid to work on Debian.
<p>The simplest thing that we can do for this is to give the possibility
to Debian's users to publish where Debian has been used and how it has
been used in the corporate world (Mandrake did something like that with
<a href="http://www.mandrakebizcases.com">MandrakeBizCases</a>).
<p>That website could also give links to the pages which might
interest companies looking into corporate use of Debian. I'm
thinking about the <a href="$(HOME)/consultants/">consultants
pages</a> or the list of vendors who sell <a
href="$(HOME)/distrib/pre-installed">Debian pre-installed
hardware</a>.

<h3><a name="otherdistro">2.8 Acknowledge and cooperate with distributions based on Debian</a></h3>
<p>All the distributions that are based on Debian help Debian by
spreading the .deb package format and by providing other (and sometimes
simpler) ways to install Debian. We must be proud of them because they
always reuse many things of Debian, they don't fork for the sake of it,
they add some value to Debian. And most of the time, they contribute it
back.
<p>That's why I think that we should have a web page acknowledging
their existence (something <a
href="$(HOME)/misc/related_links">already exists</a> but it
needs to be improved and to be more visible). I also think that we should
reinforce relationships with them, just to make sure that the most
interesting items are contributed back.

That's enough I guess, a year is only 365 days. :-) If you are interested to
work on any of those projects, feel free to let me know.
Of course, there are many other projects which are worth doing (simpler
installer based on debian-installer or the recently announced PGI,
hardware detection in standard, ...) and I hope that we'll achieve them
but they're not really under the DPL's responsibility.
</cite>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Thank you for your attention. This upcoming year is going to be very
exciting and very hard for the next leader; he will need your support.
That's why I hope you will all vote in the forthcoming election. Until then,
have fun !

<h1> Rebuttal </h1>
<h2> About Bdale's platform</h2>

<p>
I don't have much to say about Bdale's platform since I agree with most of
what he said. I can only recognize his experience within Debian and the
invaluable work he has already done. I share his vision of Debian; however
I think that his platform lacks concrete propositions. It's perfectly
understandable because you can know where you want to go without knowing
how you'll go. If he's elected, I hope he will see that some of the
projects that I propose are going in the direction where he wants to lead
us and that as such he will promote them enough to make them happen.
</p><p>
He mentioned that he would attend many events due to his new job in the
Linux Labs at HP; as such I'd be more than happy if he wanted to be one of
the DPL representatives.
</p>
<p>
Bdale would certainly<sup>*1</sup> get my support for any concrete
project he would like to launch related to one of the items he
mentioned in his platform ("Quality", "Release predictability", "User
First Impression", "Infrastructure", "Security", "Linux Standard
Base").
</p>

<p>
[*1]  Well, I can't guarantee it since I don't know what those projects
would be... but I'm saying that because I know that Bdale is very
reasonable and has always done a good job. Take that as a proof of trust.

<h2> About Branden's platform</h2>

<p>
Branden is *someone* within Debian, nobody is indifferent to him.
People may remember how we gently flamed each other. I'm familiar
with Branden's way of doing; I wish everyone would be, at least they
wouldn't feel hurt when they discuss with him. :-) I have to admit that
I appreciate Branden's effort to be more comprehensive and to flame only
as a last resort. Keep up the effort ! ;-)
</p>

<p>
He has always done a great job with XFree86 and he has proven
his ability to manage other non-technical issues (SPI treasurer comes
to my mind first but I also think of the various propositions he made
to change the constitution or the Debian Machine Usage Policy, and also
several things he managed on debian-private that I can't quote here :-)).
</p>

<p>
Here are my comments about his platform. While I understand the
motivation of clearly defining the role of DPL delegates I do think that
it's not useful for Debian and that it's just the kind of bureaucracy that
we don't need. Teams are well known, people who are part of them too,
and the way to get in touch with them is documented. We don't need
more than that. The "keeping the developer base active" and "Debian's
representation at function" are two items of his platform which I
fully share. The items "Debian's relationship with SPI" and "Reactivation
of the Debian technical committee" are two projects that I'm not much
interested in but that are valuable and worth pursuing and as such I'd be
happy to let Branden manage them as a DPL delegate.
</p>

<h2> About my platform</h2>


<p>
At this point, I do not want to change anything in my platform (except a few
spelling errors :-)); I believe that the required clarifications have
already been given on debian-vote. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest concern has been about "SourceForge". We won't call it
"SourceForge" to make it obvious that it's not affiliated to VA Research.
But we'll use the sourceforge code since it's packaged and it does work.
However if someone comes up with another working free software with as
many features, we'll consider it of course.
