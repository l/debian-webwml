#use wml::debian::template title="Platforms for Bdale Garbee" BARETITLE="true"

<h1> Introduction / Biography </h1>
My name is Bdale Garbee, and I ask you to elect me as your next Debian 
Project Leader.  For those of you new to the project in the last year who
are curious, Bdale is a contraction of Barksdale, and I pronounce it 
"Bee-Dale". 
<p>
My platform posting from 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2001/debian-vote-200102/msg00038.html"> last year's DPL campaign </a>
is full of biographical information about me.
One significant thing has changed since then...
<p>
In May of 2001 I accepted an offer to re-join Hewlett-Packard, this time as
an Engineer/Scientist in the Linux Systems Operation (LSO).  
HP supports multiple Linux distributions on multiple processor architectures 
in a wide variety of product forms.  That translates into lots of interesting
work, and I'm enjoying the challenges.
<p>
Debian is our development platform in LSO for the kernel and related 
work required to enable Linux support on HP's hardware.  That means I get to 
spend part of my time working on Debian, particularly the IA-64 port.  But my 
job also includes:
<ul>
<li> helping make sure HP participates as a good citizen in the Debian and 
	larger Open Source communities
<li> architecting solutions that enable multi-architecture, multi-distribution 
	Linux installation and support on HP hardware
<li> leading technical development of HP's Linux Enablement Kit products
<li> helping form HP Linux strategy
</ul>
<p>
One neat consequence of this job change is that I am now more able to attend
and speak at Linux and related technical conferences than before.  I attended
ALS for the first time in Oakland last autumn, and recently returned from 
Brisbane where I spoke at Linux Conference Australia 2002 and in the Debian
mini-conference that preceded it.  
<p>
The Debian community is full of interesting people, and I really enjoy meeting
many of you in person, putting faces to names, and gaining some personal 
context to improve the quality and effectiveness of our online discussions.

<h1> My Goals </h1>

The "L" in DPL stand for "Leader", and the reason you should elect me
is that I am the right person to provide Debian with <b> clear and effective 
leadership </b>.
<p>
Effective leadership requires several things.  The group must have shared
values, must agree on a vision of what the future might hold if all goes well,
and must develop and follow plans for moving from the current state towards
the vision state.  The primary role of the leader is facilitation, which comes
in many forms.

<h2> Values </h2>

I believe the Debian community already shares strong core values, though
we may have differences of opinion on peripheral issues.  One of our real 
successes, aided in recent times by our new maintainer process, is that 
people joining our project share a strong belief in Free Software and the 
Community Development Model.  
<p>
As I have talked to other groups about Debian in recent months, our strongly
held core values come up over and over again as a key reason for the success
Debian has enjoyed.  Other groups envy our ability to attract attention, 
motivate so many developers, maintain so many packages across so many
architectures, and remain viable despite major organization and 
infrastructure changes over the years.
<p>
These key values are in no immediate danger.  They are strongly held, and
rightfully so.  But nurturing them, acting in adherence with them, and 
continuing to communicate them as key elements of what is special about 
Debian are clearly things we should expect of our DPL.

<h2> Vision </h2>

Debian has achieved some wonderful results, but whether we will continue to 
improve is largely a function of how motivated we are.  My experience
leading volunteer efforts suggests to me that the best motivators are a 
strong shared vision which each participant can feel connected to, and
processes that allow contributors to see results from their efforts.
<p>
Unfortunately, I think it has been a long time since Debian had a clearly 
articulated vision.  It's time to fix that.
<p>
Back before we selected the swirl logo for Debian, our web pages sported 
a graphic composed of colored puzzle pieces, and the text 
"Debian: The Universal Operating System".  Whenever I think about Debian, 
that idea is what comes first to my mind.  
<p>
Every once in a while, someone on our mailing lists tries to assert that 
Debian can't or shouldn't be everything to everybody.  It usually doesn't 
take long for someone else to reply "why not?".  Why not, indeed?  The 
Debian community is now large enough and diverse enough to support as many
sub-projects catering to different user communities as we can imagine.  There
is no reason that we can't eventually be a truly universal operating system!
I can't imagine a more compelling vision for our future.
<p>
But, if we are going to make Debian a truly universal operating system, we
face a number of continuing challenges.

<h3> Quality </h3>

When Ian Murdock wrote his Debian Manifesto early in the project's history, 
he made it clear that one of Debian's primary objectives would be to achieve 
and maintain the highest quality standards.  After maintaining several dozen 
packages, and working on 5 ports of Debian over the years (Alpha, Sparc, 
ARM, PARISC, and IA-64), it is clear to me that the most important thing
we can do is continue pushing to improve Debian's code quality.  Our users 
expect and deserve to receive software from us that "just works".
<p>
I believe the biggest improvements we've made in code quality over the years
have come as a result of our porting efforts, and as a result of regularizing
tools and processes for building quality into our packages.  Achieving our
vision will mean continuing those efforts, and finding ways to do more.
<p>
Our packaging policies recommend the use of -Wall when compiling, and most
of our packages comply.  What many maintainers may not realize, however, is
that what is "just a warning" on one platform may be a fatal error on another.
Now that the logs from our package auto-builders are available online, anyone
can audit packages for potential problems, and we should encourage more
people to help!
<p>
I'm a big fan of helper packages like debhelper, but not as a way for 
maintainers to avoid having to learn how to build correct packages... any more
than calculators are an excuse for children to not learn how to add and 
subtract.  Rather, I think reasonable use of helper packages does a lot to
improve consistency of packaging and avoid silly mistakes.  
<p>
I'm also a big fan of tools like lintian, which help us catch more silly
mistakes that otherwise would reduce our archive quality.  The tools
we have today are not a panacea.  I've done my share of ranting about checks
in lintian that are just plain wrong, or overly simplistic.  But I still run
a lintian check on every one of my packages before I upload it, and I wish
everyone else would too. 
<p>
Recent efforts to start measuring quality in our archive by asking questions 
like "how many of our packages can be built from source today?" are 
commendable.  I hope to see those activities continue and expand.  
At the conference I attended
in Australia recently, I was approached by a graduate student interested in
the prospect of using Debian's package pool as input for various software
quality efforts.  That's pretty neat, and I did my best to encourage the 
idea, in the hope that eventually something useful to Debian might come of
it.

<h3> Release Predictability </h3>

There are lots of reasons that going so long between major releases isn't a
good idea for Debian.  The two I care most about right now are that many of
us have a hard time retaining focus and motivation when our work never gets
released, and that it's hard for Debian to be taken seriously as an alternative
to commercial distributions when our last stable release is years old.  
<p>
If we want to be a universal operating system, we need to be more predictable
about releases.
<p>
The work done since potato released to rework our archive is really important.
Implementing package pools, and the work Anthony Towns put into implementing 
the logic for promoting packages into our testing distribution, are key to
getting control over our release process in the future.  We have all been 
frustrated by the amount of time it has taken to make the transition.  It 
hasn't helped that we've had parallel projects to do things like allow crypto 
into US main that have taken much longer to implement than any of us 
initially hoped.  However, I'm pretty confident that the tools and processes 
now in place give us the opportunity to be much more predictable about our 
release schedules in the future.
<p>
I completely agree with the assertion that we need to remember that Debian is
a mostly-volunteer project and that volunteers really can't be coerced into 
doing things they don't want to do.  However, my experience is that volunteers
rally behind clear statements of vision and purpose... and in many cases will
work harder when they're excited about being part of something good than they
would ever work when being coerced.  So, I don't see a conflict.  We should
be able to establish tentative release schedules and have some idea what new
features will be available when those release times come.  Doing so will give
us all goals to aspire to, and the real sense of accomplishment that comes
from a successful release on a regular basis.

<h3> User First Impression </h3>

We've all heard for years that Debian is wonderful once you get it installed, 
but hard to install.  I actually like Debian's current installer, but then I
also like dselect... probably because I've been around the project since before
either of them were invented, and know how to drive them almost in my sleep.
But that doesn't make them good for everyone.
<p>
As part of my new job, I've spent time loading and
studying various commercial Linux distributions.  There are some things 
Debian's current installation tool set does amazingly well, but there are also 
things about it that are really confusing and frustrating for newcomers to 
Debian, much less to Linux.  We can and should do better if we want to be a
universal operating system.
<p>
The consensus among those working on it appears to be that boot-floppies as
we know it today should end with woody, and be replaced by something better
for our next major release.  We have many of the components of the proposed
next-generation Debian installer already in the works.  
<p>
At the same time, other interesting things have happened.  Without much 
fanfare, the graphical installation tools developed by Progeny for their 
Debian-derived distribution have been enhanced, packaged, and are now part 
of Debian main.  Others have pointed out that commercial Linux distribution 
installers have some excellent features, and most are Open Source so we can 
borrow from them at will.  
<p>
We have also seen in recent months an increase in the diversity of installation
media, including the installer-only CD images made available for the PARISC 
and IA-64 ports, and in various flavors for i386 systems. 
Several groups are working on tools to support unattended installs, with at
least two tool suites I know of already packaged and in our archive.  And
I and others are working on ways for users to avoid much of the complexity
of our current installation process by delivering mostly-configured OS
images that prompt the user for final configuration choices on first power up.
<p>
I almost feel that we have an embarrassment of riches available to us for our
installation tool set(s) beyond woody.  We just need to figure out which pieces 
to apply in various combinations to optimally meet the needs of our 
different user communities.  

<h3> Infrastructure </h3>

I don't know how many are aware of just how big Debian's infrastructure
requirements really are.  As the number of registered developers and the 
packages they maintain continue to grow approximately linearly, the disk space 
required to store the archive, the network bandwidth required to mirror
the archive, and the computational resources required to keep all the packages
auto-built for all of our supported architectures keeps climbing.  
<p>
We are fortunate that the value we deliver, and our strong reputation, have
led to so many donations of various resources to meet these needs. 
<p>
As the person who put the first master.debian.org together oh so long ago, I've
been thinking about and paying attention to Debian's infrastructure issues for
a long time.  I chat fairly frequently with the people who do much of the work
of maintaining our archive and mirror network, and I hear about many of the 
problems they encounter.  
Talking with our Australian counterparts recently in Brisbane,
where bandwidth cost is much higher than in the US, helped me to remember
that we need to be pro-active about managing the cost and complexity of the
infrastructure supporting our operations.
<p>
We should talk up the benefits of implementing caching proxy servers instead
of mirrors for many users, and provide either packages or cookbook instructions
on how to implement resource-efficient solutions.  We should continue to look
at ways to reduce the bandwidth requirements both for our mirror network, and
for individual users updating over the network... and be willing to implement
good solutions when we find them.

<h3> Security </h3>

To be a universal operating system, we need to avoid having to apologize to
our users.  Several complementary proposals for improving the ability to
verify the authenticity of our work are in various states of deployment.  I
hope to see these continued.
<p>
I think we could also do a better job of helping our users be secure in the 
things they do with Debian, by enabling crypto support in more of the 
applications we ship.  Having to build and support both crypto and non-crypto 
versions of some of our key applications has taken a lot of energy that could
have gone to better use.  That's why I'm such a strong supporter of the effort 
to move Open Source crypto into US main, and thrilled that we're on the verge
of implementing the change as I write this text.

<h3> Linux Standard Base </h3>

In our Social Contract, we commit to serving users of Debian even when they
need to run non-free software.  We could do more to help enterprise customers
use Debian than we do today, with some potentially very positive results.
<p>
Enterprise customers want to be able to buy big third-party, binary-only
application suites with support contracts, and run them on our operating
system.  It would be easy to dismiss these folks as peripheral to our primary
goals, since we share such a strong value on Free Software.  However, these
folks often really want to run Debian on their systems, but can't because the
application vendor only certifies their application on some other distribution.
If we can manage to meet enterprise needs and thereby help out our friends in
industry without compromising our system or our values, we should do it.
<p>
The LSB is the solution to this problem.  If successful, the interfaces defined
by the LSB will become the target platform for big application developers to
deliver to.  It won't matter whether the system is Debian, RedHat, SuSE, or 
something completely different... as long as the system is LSB compliant.  
This will remove a substantial barrier to the acceptance of Debian in 
corporate computing environments that currently exists, taking us one step 
closer to being a universal operating system.
<p>
A lot of fear and confusion surrounds the LSB.  It doesn't
require that we abandon our package format, or make onerous changes in our
system to be compliant.  The LSB as it stands today is not perfect.  Early 
versions of the specification have serious issues that need to be resolved 
before the LSB becomes truly viable.  These are all solvable problems.
<p>
Many major commercial distributions are now on record as supporting the
LSB, and I think it's important that Debian does too.  We have no vested
interest in maintaining the status quo, and could reap strong benefits from
being the best LSB-compliant distribution available.  We shouldn't be at all
passive about this.  We should be willing to do the work, and fight the fights
that are required to ensure that the LSB specification evolves into a truly 
useful standard that we can support with enthusiasm.  

<h1> Summary </h1>

I have been a developer of and advocate for Free Software since before we 
knew what we were supposed to call it.  I joined the Debian community in early
1995, and have been steadily and substantially contributing to our success
in a variety of ways ever since.
<p>
Working on Debian is my way of expressing my most strongly held beliefs about
freedom, choice, quality, and utility.  I have a vision for what Debian can
be, and the skills and experience as a leader to nurture and communicate that 
vision.  I ask you to elect me as your project leader so that together, we can
make our vision a reality.
<p>
Thank you for your time, and your vote!
