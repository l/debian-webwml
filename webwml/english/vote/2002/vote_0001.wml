  <vstatistics />
  <p>Some 
   <a href="stats">statistics</a> have been gathered about ballots and
   acknowledgements periodically during the voting period.
   Additionally, the list of <a href="voters.txt">people</a> for the
   election is available, complete with tokens so that the voters may
   check their votes were tallied. The <a href="tally.txt">tally
   sheet</a> is also present.  In the following table, tally[row
   x][col y] represents the votes that candidate x received over candidate y.
   A <a href="http://www.electionmethods.org/CondorcetEx.htm">more
     detailed explanation of the beat matrix</a> may help in
   understanding the table.
