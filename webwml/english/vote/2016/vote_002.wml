Title: Declassifying parts of -private of historical interest

<ol>
<li>The 2005 General Resolution titled "Declassification of debian-private
   list archives" is repealed.

<li>Debian listmasters and/or other individuals delegated by the DPL to
   do so are authorized to declassify excerpts of -private of historical
   interest by any process which at minimum provides sufficient time and
   opportunity for Debian Developers to object by GR prior to
   declassification.

<li>In keeping with paragraph 3 of the Debian Social Contract, Debian
   Developers are strongly encouraged to use the debian-private mailing
   list only for discussions that should not be disclosed.
</ol>
