This file contains a list of bad links found in pages in this directory.
Please fix them. Note that the program that checks the links makes
some errors:
 - It times out too quickly
 - It doesn't handle some urls correctly. This is indicated by a line beginning
   'Use of uninitialized value'
Ignore errors resulting from these problems.
