    <h2> Introduction / Biography </h2>

    <p>
      My name is Bdale Garbee, and I ask you to re-elect me as your 
      Debian Project Leader.
    </p>

    <p>
      For those of you who are new to the project, my platform posting from 
      <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2001/debian-vote-200102/msg00038.html">two
	years ago </a> 
      is full of biographical information about me, and my platform from 
      <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2002/platforms/bdale"> last
	year </a>  
      contains many ideas that are still relevant.</p>

    <p>
      After Hewlett-Packard completed the merger with Compaq, the
      organization I work for was restructured and changed names.  We
      are now known as the Linux and Open Source Lab (LOSL).  I thank
      my managers at HP for their strong support in the last year,
      which included allowing me to spend part of my work time on
      Debian, and supporting my travel to the many conferences where I
      gave Debian talks in the last year.</p>

    <p>
      I maintain the Debian ia64 autobuilder, and while I gave away
      several of my more complicated packages in the last year to have
      more time for my duties as Leader, I still maintain quite a
      few.</p>

    <h2> Thoughts on the Past Year </h2>

    <p>
      The biggest and best news of 2002 was the release of Debian 3.0
      (woody)!
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, we had a very good year.  Making a major release always
      brings attention to the project... it excites users, broadens
      the deployment of real improvements in our software, and
      motivates the press and others to take a fresh look at us.  As a
      volunteer organization, all of these activities provide us with
      feedback and encouragement that motivate us to greater
      accomplishments.</p>
    <p>
      The world is recognizing that Debian is more than "just another
      Linux distribution."  Our reputation is growing, and our
      relationships with other organizations continue to improve.  A
      consequence of this is that we are now often asked to
      participate in working groups, standards bodies, and similar
      activities... instead of fighting to avoid being overlooked!</p>
    <p>
      I indicated last year that I believe the primary role of a
      leader is facilitation.  I approached this by spending a lot of
      my "Leader time" listening and reading, looking for contributors
      I could send words of encouragement to, making connections
      between contributions by introducing people to each other, and
      generally working to guide our collective actions towards our
      vision.</p>
    <p>
      I also invested time traveling to speak on behalf of Debian at
      various events around the world.  I publish the <a
      href="http://www.gag.com/~bdale/talks/">presentation
      materials</a> used for my talks, and welcome feedback or
      questions about them.  A positive side-effect of my travel was
      the opportunity to meet many of you in person, share your
      enthusiasm and listen to your concerns, and foster the growth of
      Debian as a community.</p>

    <h2> Areas of Focus for the Next Year </h2>
    <p>
      Last year, I articulated a vision of Debian as a Universal
      Operating System.  It pleases me greatly that so many of you
      support this vision.  References to it appeared in
      presentations, interviews, and documents of various kinds
      throughout the year.  I continue to believe that this should be
      our core vision for Debian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first release of Debian was made in 1993, and a goal that I
      share with our release manager Anthony Towns is to celebrate our
      first decade as a project with the release of a new stable
      version of Debian in 2003.</p>
    <p>
      Many of the challenges I outlined last year still exist.  While
      we made progress in many areas, there are still numerous
      improvements we can make.  To advance our vision, and focus our
      attention in the coming year, I would like to highlight three
      areas of activity I feel are particularly important.</p>

    <h2> Flavors </h2>
    <p>
      For several years, I have spoken about the idea of "flavors of
      Debian" as a logical next step in our evolution.  A flavor could
      exist for each sub-project of Debian that targets the needs of a
      specific user group.  Each flavor would consist of a proper
      subset of all Debian packages, perhaps bundled with meta
      information that allows for quick and easy installation of a
      default configuration.
    </p>   
    <p>
      All packages used in all flavors would continue to be developed,
      maintained, and promoted through our release processes in the
      usual ways.  The set of flavors might appear as a set of
      additional Packages files that are subsets of the complete
      version, and/or alternate installation media that contain the
      packages and meta information required to install a particular
      flavor.</p>
    <p>
      Implemented well, flavors would give our users the flexibility
      to focus on just the packages relevant to their area of
      interest, while making the full power of the Debian universe
      available to them whenever they want or need it.</p>

    <h2> Internationalization </h2>
    <p>
      We can and should deliver a better initial experience for users
      who are not native speakers of English.
    </p>
    <p>
      The native language support added to the Debian 3.0 installer
      was a big step in the right direction, but after watching an
      installation demonstration in Mexico last December, I realized
      just how frustrating it still must be for a new user who does
      not speak English.  The installer itself worked well, but once
      package configuration began, many of the debconf questions
      appeared in English.  It asks a lot of a new user to learn and
      understand new concepts well enough to make good choices during
      an installation session that flips back and forth between
      English and their native language.</p>
    <p>
      While improving our installation experience generally may lead
      to fewer questions that need to be answered, any questions we do
      ask during an initial installation must be presentable in at
      least a core set of languages other than English.</p>
    <p>
      I believe that a reasonable and desirable goal for our next
      stable release is to ensure that new users can successfully
      install at least one flavor of Debian entirely in their native
      language, for some set of languages to be determined.</p>

    <h2> Community </h2>
    <p>
      The Debian community reaches beyond our database of registered
      developers.  I have observed that the places in the world where
      Debian is used the most and has the strongest support are the
      areas where there is strong involvement with local user groups.
      Helping users feel involved and appreciated is important for the
      health of our community.</p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges facing communities in general is
      communication, and Debian is no exception.  Debian Weekly News
      plays an important role by making it possible to track important
      discussions on our mailing lists without needing to read
      everything.  However, it can only report on what it knows about!
      I encourage delegates and representatives from our various
      sub-projects to generate summaries or updates about progress in
      their areas for publication in DWN, or on our lists in the
      spirit of my "Bits from the DPL" messages.</p>
    <p>
      Our sense of community is based on our shared values, and the
      activities we engage in to foster those values despite our many
      differences.  No single change or action will solve all of our
      communication concerns, but if we all make an effort to better
      communicate our actions and progress to others, the cumulative
      effect will make a difference!</p>

    <h2> Summary </h2>
    <p>
    I'm proud of what Debian has accomplished, and what we represent.
    I worked hard in the last year to establish good working
    relationships inside and outside our community, to foster
    activities within the project that further our vision, and to
    represent Debian well in public.</p>
    <p>
      Working on Debian continues to be my way of expressing my most
      strongly held beliefs about freedom, choice, quality, and
      utility.</p>
    <p>
      I ask you for the opportunity to continue serving as Debian
      Project Leader.</p>
    <p>
      Thank you for your time, and your vote!</p>

<h2> Rebuttal </h2>
<p>
I appreciate the confidence in my ability to represent Debian shown by both
Martin and Branden in their platforms.
</p>
<p>
The platforms that Moshe and Branden present represent nearly opposite 
approaches.  I believe the Debian community expects and deserves more 
involvement from the project leader than Moshe offers, while Branden proposes
a much more active role for the DPL based on greater process formalism.
</p>
<p>
Martin talks in his platform about the things he has worked on in Debian and
the projects he would like to pursue.  I am aware of, appreciate, and support 
these activities... but as he points out himself, most of them have little to
do with leading the project.  Many of the things he says about how he would 
act in the role of DPL describe the way I have tried to operate, in particular
I think we have very similar ideas about how to build the sense of community 
within Debian.  
</p>
<p>
Effectively leading a volunteer project like Debian requires patience, and 
balanced application of many forms of motivation and encouragement.  I placed
a strong emphasis in my platform on communication within our community, 
because many concerns brought to my attention as DPL in the past year have 
been or could be addressed by improving communication on some level.  
</p>
<p>
None of the other candidates articulates a vision for Debian's future, which 
I believe is an essential component of leadership.  I continue to believe I 
am the candidate best able to advance our vision as Debian Project Leader.  
</p>
<p>
I have quietly but consistently made good things happen for Debian since 1995.
I continue to bring people and other resources to the project.  I'd like the 
opportunity to continue putting the relationships I've established on behalf 
of Debian in the last year to work, and hope you will join me in continuing 
to make our vision of Debian as a Universal Operating System a reality.
</p>
<p>
Thank you again for your time, and your vote!
