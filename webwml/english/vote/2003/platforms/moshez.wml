    <h2>Platform</h2>
    <blockquote>
      <em>Do nothing unless you must, and when you must act -- hesitate.</em>
      (Isaac Asimov, Foundation's Edge)
    </blockquote>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      As Debian Project Leader, I promise to do as little as
      possible. If a delegate position needs to be filled, I will
      attempt to pick someone as close to the consensus as
      possible. Other than that, I will not attempt to create new
      positions, nor to advance new directions within Debian. It is my
      firm belief that Debian survives and flourishes because of the
      people doing the day to day job, and they deserve the most
      credit. Therefore, I will let each delegate work within his
      niche according to his wishes, and will not micromanage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Debian Project Leader, I believe, is primarily about
      representing the project to the outside world. In that capacity,
      for every free software related function (be it a conference, a
      trade-show or anything else), any Debian developers who wish to
      volunteer to represent Debian will get an ad-hoc position to
      represent Debian in that function. I firmly believe that any
      Debian developer can represent Debian interest's well.
    </p>
    <h2>SPI</h2>

    <p>
      Apparently, SPI is undergoing elections. I cannot predict, and
      would not want to, who will win. I can promise that I will make
      sure the treasurer, whoever he is, does not use funds earmarked
      for Debian for non-Debian purposes. Whatever else SPI does is up
      to the SPI board and members, and as DPL I would let them run
      SPI as they see fit.
    </p>
    <h2>Debian</h2>

    <p>
      For me, Debian is an operating system. It is, when I think
      about it, the only operating system which satisfies my minimum
      criteria: it is portable, it is comprehensive and it is free. I
      sincerely hope that Debian continues to be a good operating
      system and even improve: to have less bugs, to have more
      packages and to run on more platforms and operating systems. I
      fully realize that the DPL has little effect on the various
      efforts to do so, and so the only campaign promise I can make is
      to get out of the way of the good people who are doing the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that, I will try, as far as my position as DPL allows
      me, to have other people stay out of the way of the useful
      people. I will refuse to let Debian become a generic
      organization for free software or against software
      patents. Individual developers are free, of course, to join such
      organizations as the EFF and the FSF: I myself support those
      organizations whole-heartedly. In fact, I believe the EFF and
      FSF do their jobs admirably, and I would not attempt to have
      Debian compete with them.
    </p>
    <h2>IRC</h2>


    <p>
      The Freenode vs. OFTC war has raged for several months. In
      retrospect, I believe that pointing irc.debian.org towards a
      network we had no control of (and therefore, no inherent
      attachment to) has been a mistake. However, what is done is
      done: our users have come to expect that if they login to
      irc.d.o, they can expect to find a useful #debian. In the
      interests of not making a bad situation worse, I think it would
      be useful to keep irc.d.o pointing towards Freenode. If it so
      happens, and I have no reason to believe so, that Freenode goes
      below a certain threshold of usefulness (for example, it stops
      existing altogether), I'd encourage to point irc.d.o to OFTC.
      If that happens, I will appeal to the Debian community, via a
      General Resolution, for what irc.d.o should be in the long run.
    </p>
    <h2>English</h2>


    <p>
      As some of you may know, I am not a native English speaker, and
      I come from a country where English is not an official
      language. However, I feel that it is important for all Debian
      developers to be able to communicate. Therefore, I feel that
      Debian development should continue to be conducted in English.
      I fear that attempting to cater to different language inside the
      Debian development process would lead to fragmentation and
      miscommunication. That said, I support translation
      efforts. Users of Debian should not have to learn English just
      to use it. In addition, if translators wish to have a bug report
      translation service, they are most welcome to.
    </p>

    <h2>Rebuttal</h2>

    <p>
	The candidates all speak of the wonderous things they can do
	as DPLs, while forgetting one thing: the DPL is afforded very
	little power by the constitution.  If we want to vote on a
	"Debian Merit Badge", or a "Most Likely to Do Stuff For
	Debian", then I am not the best candidate. However, it is my
	belief we are not: we are voting for a capable administator
	for those responsibilities the constitution has placed in the
	hands of the Debian Project Leader. As such, perhaps it is the
	term "leader" that confuses us: in fact, what the consitution
	defines would be more aptly called "the Debian Project
	Administrator". I do not feel it is the DPL's goal to inspire
	technical directions: such directions come aplenty from inside
	the developer community (for example, the Debian Desktop
	project, or the Debian Installer project). I do not feel it is
	the DPL's goal to solve most of the disputes: most of those
	are better off "unsolved" or solved by the tech-ctte. I fail
	to see why Martin Michlmayr, of whom I have great
	appreciation, I fail to see why he cannot co-ordinate and
	motivate people without being DPL. After all, as DPL, he would
	not get any co-ordination powers. I fail to see why Bdale
	cannot support flavours, i18n and communication within the
	community without having "DPL" stamped on his
	forehead. Branden claims the DPL's chief responsibility is
	delegation, with which I agree. But surely, he can write the
	web-page with the list of delegates without being DPL, unless
	DPL empowers him to learn HTML.
    </p>

    <p>
	Branden claimed that the "potential problems" I pointed out in
	my platform are unlikely. I fully agree: I wrote them as the
	kind of situations where I will feel that in spite of my
	do-nothing policy, I am forced to act.
    </p>

    <p>
	Many would possibly question why I feel I am the most suitable
	for DPL, then.  I feel so because of all the candidates, I
	alone promise I will *not* attempt to use the DPL's power more
	than absolutely necessary. I promise that I will not try to
	meddle in your internal projects, your policies or disputes,
	but will let you work it out between yourselves, like the
	responsible adults that we all hope Debian Developers are. I
	feel that all the other candidates have an inherently
	condescnending platform, while I am merely offering my
	services to the Debian Developer community.
    </p>

    <p>
	I have already noted elsewhere that I do not expect to win. I
	do not expect to win because I feel that the DPL position is
	awarded as a merit badge, rather than as a position of
	trust. If you do not believe so, please vote for me.
    </p>
