    <h2>Platform</h2>

    <h2>General</h2>
    <p>
      As Debian Project Leader, I promise to do as little as
      possible. If a delegate position needs to be filled, I will
      attempt to pick someone as close to the consensus as
      possible. Other than that, I will not attempt to create new
      positions, nor to advance new directions within Debian. It is my
      firm belief that Debian survives and flourishes because of the
      people doing the day to day job, and they deserve the most
      credit. Therefore, I will let each delegate work within his
      niche according to his wishes, and will not micromanage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Debian Project Leader, I believe, is primarily about
      representing the project to the outside world. In that capacity,
      for every free software related function (be it a conference, a
      trade-show or anything else), any Debian developers who wish to
      volunteer to represent Debian will get an ad-hoc position to
      represent Debian in that function. I firmly believe that any
      Debian developer can represent Debian interest's well.
    </p>
    <h2>SPI</h2>

    <p>
      Apparently, SPI is undergoing elections. I cannot predict, and
      would not want to, who will win. I can promise that I will make
      sure the treasurer, whoever he is, does not use funds earmarked
      for Debian for non-Debian purposes. Whatever else SPI does is up
      to the SPI board and members, and as DPL I would let them run
      SPI as they see fit.
    </p>
    <h2>Debian</h2>

    <p>
      For me, Debian is an operating system. It is, when I think
      tabout it, the only operating system which satisfies my minimum
      criteria: it is portable, it is comprehensive and it is free. I
      sincerely hope that Debian continues to be a good operating
      system and even improve: to have less bugs, to have more
      packages and to run on more platforms and operating systems. I
      fully realize that the DPL has little effect on the various
      efforts to do so, and so the only campaign promise I can make is
      to get out of the way of the good people who are doing the work.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than that, I will try, as far as my position as DPL allows
      me, to have other people stay out of the way of the useful
      people. I will refuse to let Debian become a generic
      organization for free software or against software
      patents. Individual developers are free, of course, to join such
      organizations as the EFF and the FSF: I myself support those
      organizations whole-heartedly. In fact, I believe the EFF and
      FSF do their jobs admirably, and I would not attempt to have
      Debian compete with them.
    </p>
    <h2>IRC</h2>


    <p>
      The Freenode vs. OFTC war has raged for several months. In
      retrospect, I believe that pointing irc.debian.org towards a
      network we had no control of (and therefore, no inherent
      attachment to) has been a mistake. However, what is done is
      done: our users have come to expect that if they login to
      irc.d.o, they can expect to find a useful #debian. In the
      interests of not making a bad situation worse, I think it would
      be useful to keep irc.d.o pointing towards Freenode. If it so
      happens, and I have no reason to believe so, that Freenode goes
      below a certain threshold of usefulness (for example, it stops
      existing altogether), I'd encourage to point irc.d.o to OFTC.
      If that happens, I will appeal to the Debian community, via a
      General Resolution, for what irc.d.o should be in the long run.
    </p>
    <h2>English</h2>


    <p>
      As some of you may know, I am not a native English speaker, and
      I come from a country where English is not an official
      language. However, I feel that it is important for all Debian
      developers to be able to communicate. Therefore, I feel that
      Debian development should continue to be conducted in English.
      I fear that attempting to cater to different language inside the
      Debian development process would lead to fragmentation and
      miscommunication. That said, I support translation
      efforts. Users of Debian should not have to learn English just
      to use it. In addition, if translators wish to have a bug report
      translation service, they are most welcome to.
