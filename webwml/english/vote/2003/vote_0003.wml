======================================================================

 4. The Developers by way of General Resolution or election

   4.1. Powers

    Together, the Developers may:
     1. Appoint or recall the Project Leader.
     2. Amend this constitution, provided they agree with a 3:1 majority.
     3. Override any decision by the Project Leader or a Delegate.
     4. Override any decision by the Technical Committee, provided they
        agree with a 2:1 majority.
-    5. Issue nontechnical policy documents and statements.
-       These include documents describing the goals of the project, its
-       relationship with other free software entities, and nontechnical
-       policies such as the free software licence terms that Debian
-       software must meet.
-       They may also include position statements about issues of the day.
+    5. Issue, supersede and withdraw nontechnical policy documents and
+       statements.
+       These include documents describing the goals of the project, its
+       relationship with other free software entities, and nontechnical
+       policies such as the free software licence terms that Debian
+       software must meet.
+       They may also include position statements about issues of the day.
+   5.1 A Foundation Document is a document or statement regarded as
+       critical to the Project's mission and purposes.
+   5.2 The Foundation Documents are the works entitled "Debian
+       Social Contract" and "Debian Free Software Guidelines".
+   5.3 A Foundation Document requires a 3:1 super-majority for its
+       supercession.  New Foundation Documents are issued and
+       existing ones withdrawn by amending the list of Foundation
+       Documents in this constitution.
     6. Together with the Project Leader and SPI, make decisions about
        property held in trust for purposes related to Debian. (See
        s.9.1.)

======================================================================
 Rationale: The clause being modified has been seen to be quite
 ambiguous. Since the original wording appeared to be amenable to two
 wildly different interpretations, this change adds clarifying the
 language in the constitution about _changing_ non technical
 documents. Additionally, this also provides for the core documents of
 the project the same protection against hasty changes that the
 constitution itself enjoys.

======================================================================
It occurs to me that there are some people who may wish to afford the
Debian Social Contract the opportunity of a 25% minority veto, but not
wish to extend this to the Debian Free Software Guidelines.
