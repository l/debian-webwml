	  <vdebate />
	    <p>
	      Scheduled for March 7<sup>th</sup>, 22:00:00 UTC, 2003,
	      on the IRC server <kbd>irc.freenode.net</kbd>.  There
	      are to be two relevant channels, namely,
	      <em>#debian-dpl-debate</em>, and
	      <em>#debian-dpl-discuss</em>. The
	      <em>#debian-dpl-debate</em> channel will be
	      moderated. Anybody may view the proceedings, but only
	      the candidates, the moderators, and those
	      participating in the immediate discussion will be able
	      to post messages. The <em>#debian-dpl-discuss</em>
	      channel will be unmoderated, and anybody may post
	      messages to it - the intention is for real-time,
	      unmoderated discussion of the candidates' responses to
	      the debate questions.
	    </p>

          <p>Some 
         <a href="leader2003_stats">statistics</a>
	  are being gathered about ballots and acknowledgements
	  periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the
   	  list of <a href="leader2003_voters.txt">people</a>

   	  following table, tally[row x][col y] represents the votes
   	  that candidate x received over candidate y. A
