  "It looks like we're going to wait for Norman Petry's
  (&lt;npetry@accesscomm.ca&gt;) committee to come up with a set of
  recommendations for debian's constitution.  Until the voting system has
  been fixed, we should try to avoid voting on controversial issues."
  <p style="color:red; margin-left: 6%; margin-right: 3%; background-color: white;">
    This proposal has now been withdrawn in favour of the newly
    drafted <a href="$(HOME)/vote/2003/vote_0002">proposal</a> written
    with the recommendations of the constitutional committee.
