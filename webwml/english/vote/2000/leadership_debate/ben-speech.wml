<p>
What I'd like to do here is basically overview how I see Debian's current
status as a project and a group. Over the years the project has had
increases in all areas, that are starting to show some of the faults in
our structure. These are the things that need to be addressed in the
coming years in order for us to remain the formidable Open Source force
that we have been. Providing the most vast collection of software for the
greatest range of architectures, is something we do best. There is no
question of Debian's superior stability, and availability.

<p>
The key areas that we have seen problems are more administrative and
collaboration. By collaboration, I mean the communication between groups,
and by administration I mean the glue that bonds those groups and makes
them cohesive and productive.

<p>
Right now we have a very "God" like control given to each and every
maintainer. They decide what and where things happens to the packages
under their control. We cannot change this. However, we do need to expand
on it. We are starting to see development of many sub-projects under the
Debian project. These projects, no matter how well defined, have no
infrastructure in Debian's current workings. These groups are not even
recognized in our constitution, nor our development model. I'd like to
see these working groups leveraged. A structure of a basic group needs to
be defined in our development model, with each group given the
responsibility of defining specifics of it's development model. Each group
should also have primary and secondary contacts so key officers of the
project (the DPL, Release Manager, FTP Admins, etc...) have a single point
of contact into the group for decision making. Even though each group
should be recognized, I think there will be certain groups that can be
denoted as persistent. These groups (such as boot floppies, arch porters,
etc..) will be involved in regular public meetings with the DPL and other
officers of the project to make sure everything is on track.

<p>
One of the other key areas that I think needs to be addressed is the
process of accepting new members into the group. I do know that Dale
Sheetz has been working on reopening New Maintainer. I commend his efforts
and his diligence in getting this done. However this is only the first
step to resolving some issues with new developers. I believe that we need
more of an abstraction between "new" developers, and "long term" senior
developers. What I'm suggesting is that new maintainers be given
limitations when they first join (not so limiting that they cannot do the
work that we accepted them to do). Limitations can include several things.
First of all, not allowing them to do NMU's of other's packages. I think
we see too many problems with new maintainers, even though they mean well,
causing breakage in core packages. This limitation can be done in several
ways, even allowing them to do NMU's _if_ their .changes is signed by a
"senior" developer (very helpful in Bug Squashing fests). We will need
criteria for when a developer becomes a "senior" developer (obviously all
current developers will be considered "senior" if this is ever
implemented, sort of a grandfather clause :).

<p>
Last, but not final on my agenda, is the visibility of Debian. Time and
time again we see that not many people (outside the Open Source circle)
really know who Debian is and what we are about. I think we really need a
group of individuals who can get us more into the light. Obviously right
now the press team fits this description, but I don't think we have really
seen any initiative from them (I'm am not sure if this is their lack of
interest, or the lack of a "charter" for what that group is supposed to
do). We should also seek to further our self-sufficiency by making
available CD's direct from us. We have many developers who are willing to
do handle the effort. Give them some small amount of the cost in doing
this, and take the profit to the bank for future costs (we really need to
start buying our own hardware).

<p>
This is all for the time being, I'm really just getting off the ground
with my initiatives, but I am very hopeful that I can eventually make a
difference as your Project Leader.
