#use wml::debian::template title="Wichert Akkerman's Opening Speech"

<p>
Welcome to my opening speech / platform / boring rant. Since I'm
not a politician or a skilled PR person, I didn't really know what
to put in here. So I've written a short reflection on what has happened
over the last year, and what I think will/should happen next year.

<p>
The past year has been good to us, although not without problems. More
people noticed that Debian is a viable and high quality alternative to
commercial distributions, and we have seem companies ranging from Storm
to O'Reilly, from VA to Corel actively supporting Debian and basing
products on it. We now have representatives in organizations like LSB,
LPI and Linux International. 

<p>
There have also been some less pleasant events: new maintainer has been
closed for most of the year, the new release is taking longer then we
hoped, and there have been some internal discussions as well. By now
those problems have been or are being resolved, so we are in a good
shape to continue. In the end we even got better: we now have a new system
for new maintainer that can handle the higher number of people applying
for maintainership as well as help them in the beginning. And we have
learned a harsh lesson about the organizational structure in Debian. I'm
quite sure that this won't be the last time we will be hit by unpleasant
events though: Debian is continuously growing and changing, and we need
to figure out how to handle that. Old structures and ideas will need
to be revised, and new ones will arrive, and keeping up will require an
effort from everyone involved.

<p>
So, what about the next year? It looks like this will be another
exciting year. We have a lot of exciting things in the pipeline: package
pools, dpkg updates and debconf integration are already in the works.

<p>
With the growth of Debian we will have to refocus our efforts a bit
though. Currently almost everyone focuses on packaging software. That
is not good enough anymore, we also need to look at maintaining the
quality of the distribution, its support, and dare I say it's marketing.
There are already people working on that, but a lot more effort is
needed. qa.debian.org is being reorganized, which is a good start.
Nils Lohner is working on projects.debian.org, which will hopefully
help us in managing various projects. We already have a small publicity
group, but we need more people to help out by writing articles,
giving speeches, ie spreading the word. We need to keep improving
ourselves, and make sure that people know about us.

<p>
What is my motivation for wanting to be project leader for another year?
There are several actually. First off I've enjoyed doing it for the last
year. I also feel that I've just finished (most of) the learning curve
for this task and can be more effective now: I have learned a lot about
(and while) being project leader, and have met a lot of the people who make
things happen in Linux, and with that experience I strongly feel I make a good
candidate.
