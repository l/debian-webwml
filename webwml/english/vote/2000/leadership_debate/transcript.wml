<h2>Introduction</h2>
<b>Rob:</b> Good morning, afternoon and evening, everyone. :)
 Welcome to the Y2K Debian Leadership Debates
 I'm your moderator, Rob Levin, the head of operations of Open Projects

<br><b>Rob:</b>
 we've assembled you all so that we can have a public forum in which 
 the candidates can talk about who they are, and what they can bring to the
 job of Debian Project Leader
 as you'll note from the web site, this debate will be divided
into two sections:  formal question/answer and an informal q/a from the 
participants  to submit a question for the second  half, email it to:
dld2k@openprojects.net

<br><b>Rob:</b>
please make your questions fairly anonymous; we'll try to
prioritize them as best we can, but all of the questions will be posted without
headers after the debate, so the candidates and others can look at them and 
consider them we'll do that raw, so try to be nice, please :) question floods
will probably have to be removed, so please don't go there

<br><b>Rob:</b>
our candidates are Ben Collins, Wichert Akkerman, Joel Klecker
and Matthew Vernon

<br><b>Rob:</b>
tentatively, we'll provide 3 minutes per answer per candidate during
 the formal question period
 we can provide more if necessary, but we want to allow questions for
  the audience

<br><b>Rob:</b>
  when you send informal questions to dld2k@openprojects.net, please m
  ake sure the header begins with QUESTION
<br><b>Rob:</b>
  thanks
  
<h2>RMS All Free Dist</h2>

<hr>
In the past <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/1999/1/">RMS has
requested from Debian</a> a distribution that does not include any non-free
software or references to non-free software. Many ideas have been sugested to
satisfy this request. What should Debian do, if anything?
<hr>

<p><b>Matthew:</b> 
AIUI, we already do this to a greater or lesser extent - main contains only free software, and anything that depends on non-free things is in contrib. The question of whether packages should Suggest: or Recommend: non-free things is different.
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
IMHO, it would be better if they didn't, but if there are no free alternatives, then it seems sensible to provide the relevant information
<br><b>Rob:</b> 
Matthew: do you have additional comments?

<br><b>Matthew:</b>
I can see RMS's point, but I think trying to hide the fact
that &lt;foo&gt; is enhanced by &lt;bar&gt; won't gain us much

<p><b>BenC:</b> 
ok...IMO, we are already starting to see this form. Like anything it takes time to change how things have been done for so long
<br><b>BenC:</b>
I do believe that we should not completely "hide" non-free, as this is against our current beliefs to support and acknoledge that non-free software exists
<br><b>BenC:</b> 
advancements in our archive management (package pools, etc..) and package tools (apt) will allow us to give the users a clear choice as to whether or not they want non-free software
<br><b>BenC:</b> 
educating is better then forcing

<p><b>Wichert:</b> 
  I think people already know I support the idea; I've proposed doing this last year already,
   but it got stranded on the fact that it's hard to split and we didn't really know how do it
   and pressure from other things that needed more immediate attention
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   The idea of having a distribution that only uses free software
   and doesn't need anything else appeals to me, and if we can do it without
   decreasing our support for non-free software I think we should definitely do it
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   It isn't so much as hiding non-free software, as well as proving that you can live quite well without it
   We'll always have and support non-free software

<h2>NM Closing</h2>

<hr>
During your term the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9910/msg00003.html">
new-maintainer processes was closed by the new-maintainer team</a>. Many
people considered their actions to be inappropriate. How should inappropriate
unilateral actions by delegates/teams be treated by the project?
<hr>

<p><b>Wichert:</b> 
  New-maintainer might be a bad example of this actually
  New-maintainer is a really important function in Debian
  people in the committee have the power to make people developers
  or remove their developer status.
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
  I agree that new maintainer was closed for way too long
  and something should have been done earlier.
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
  However in this case the fact that a) it's a really important job where you can't easily replace people, and b) we had people in new-maintainer who were willing to continue provided there was a
  good new structure for handling it, I was very hestitant in replacing them
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
  I hope that this will prove to be the right decision in the end, but we'll have to see how it works out
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
  More generally,
  I don't think a delegate should be treated much differently in this respect then other maintainers
  If someone isn't active, we should try to get them more involved and active again
  If that really doesn't seem possible, we'll have to replace someone

<p><b>Matthew:</b> 
I think it's something that has to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In the case of nm - it seems like the problem could have been predicted before it happened. That notwithstanding, if a team decides that it's had enough, we can't (and shouldn't) force them to continue doing their task. I'm proposing to keep in contact with all such groups, so that I can monitor when things are getting tough, and take prophylactic action; prevention being
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
I'm not about to take pot-shots at people about how nm was handled, especially since it's very close to re-opening
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
The important thing now in that regard is to move forwards again.
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
Generally, better communication should prevent this sort of thing though - and I think that's very important.

<p><b>Ben:</b> 
     I think I differ in my assessment of the "new maintainer fallout" in that I think it deals more generally with some core issues in our structure...
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     after talking to a couple of people involved with new maintainer I was shown that they were basically asking for help quite a while before they decided to close
     asking for help indirectly, but still, they asked
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     I don't think anyone can point fingers since no one was at fault
     we were just not prepared structurally to deal with such as event
     the future holds some very significant changes, in that we need a better structure to handle our core functionlity...things like ftp admin, system admin, new maintainer etc...
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     there is not a very well defined strucure insuring that these functions (aside from the people) will go on inthe event that another fallout occurs
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     this needs to be changed

<h2> Growing unwieldly, AWOL maintainers and delegation issue</h2>

<hr>
Debian's recent
<a href="http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/stats/numpackages.gif">growth
has been tremendous</a>. The project has nearly doubled its size in all
areas. Is this growth maintainable? Should anything be done to make Debian
more scalable or to reduce the growth?
<hr>

<p><b>Matthew:</b> 
  As I said in my opening speech, communication seems to be the key to maintaining growth.
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
  The DPL needs to keep in touch with the various groups (ftp-admin, nw, qa, and so on) to ensure that they're happy and everything is going OK. Tasks that used to only need one or two people will need to be taken on by more people, and the DPL will have to co-ordinate that.

<p><b>Ben:</b> 
     ok, I hate to make direct comments on another candidates answer, but hey, this is a debate :)
<br><b>Rob:</b> 
     BenC: it's permitted
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     I disagree that were are in a manageable state right now
     there are much needed tasks that are impossible to do at this point
     removing the cruft from our archive in over 4000 packages and 7+ archs is next undoable by any means
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     we will have to install better control over our archive...
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
     communications is also not the single key answer...without a working basis on which to develop (well defined charters for each of the groups), we cannot not know who to talk to , or who needs to make the decisions vital to sustaining our growth

<p><b>Wichert:</b> 
   So far we seem to be handling the growth pretty well, and I think it's done is
   a lot of good as well. However it will mean we'll have to constantly look at
   our organization and see if it needs to be changes. We already did this by
   creating lists like debian-devel and debian-private, creating a new-maintainer
   team, a constitution, etc. As I also already said in my openening speech we
   will need to focus on areas such as quality control as well.  
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   I think we have reached the point were a single person can't keep in touch with
   everything that is happening in Debian anymore, and we'll need to see how
   to that influences the project. I think that his year we'll have to figure out
   how we should manage `projects' that focus more on specific areas of Debian,
   such as boot-floppies, quality control, documentation, archive management, etc.  
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   This will without doubt create some struggles, since it means it will be harder
   for people to keep track of everything. Hopefully things like Debian Weekly News
   will help us there.

<h2>Debian BSD and Hurd</h2>

<hr>
Two sub-projects within Debian are aimed at developing ports of Debian to
the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/">Hurd</a> and 
<a href="http://master.debian.org/~dexter/debian-freebsd/doc/whatisit">BSD
platforms</a>. Some of the suggested plans would make these ports
considerably different from the Linux platform. How much leeway should 
these ports have to deviate from the other platforms? Should Debian focus on 
its core Linux distribution or try to spread to many OSs?
<hr>

<p><b>Matthew:</b> 
 Well, as someone who works on -hurd, I may be a little biased in this regard, but I don't see a problem as such with non-Linux OSs being part of Debian
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
 As long as those Oss are free, and they don't conflict with policy in too many ways (GNU/Hurd, for instance has shadowfs (or will do), which means it may not make a distinction between /bin and /usr/bin, for example)
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
 I think it's a good thing, but clearly involves some problems that our current infrastructure doesn't deal with very well (Architecture: all becomes less accurate, and there are sometimes OS-specific bugs in packages, for instance).
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
 If we can sort these issues out, then I think non-linux ports will make Debian more flexible, and more attractive to admins.
<br><b>Matthew:</b> 
 We should maintain our Linux focus for the foreseeable future, however.

<p><b>Ben:</b> 
      I think the entire idea of providing alternate OS's is part of Debian's heritage...
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
      Linux was in this state when Debian first started, so it is not outside of our beliefs, so long as we adhere to the freeness issues, which BSD and Hurd do...
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
      Obviously the groups handling such ports should hold the responsibility of devising structure and maintainence to allow their OS's to be side-by-side on our archive with Linux...at the same time other developers should be willing to accept these changes and help the groups whenever possible with ideas and feedback
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
      i think one of th biggest hurdles is the focus on intel-linux specific views
      bugs and changes that affect only non-intel archs, and even more so, non-linux ports, are not viewed with as much priority
<br><b>Ben:</b> 
      this is starting to subside to a great extent, but these views need to snuffed completely

<p><b>Wichert:</b> 
   This will differ per port; from what I know for the BSD port the strategy is to have a small BSD base system and use the FreeBSD Linux compatability support to run the normal GNU/Linux userland, which means we don't need to do a lot to support it.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   For the HURD we will probably see that more HURD-specific packages will arrive, which shouldn't be a problem.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   Some packages will be difficult though, since they will need major per-OS changes.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   I don't think that at the moment we really know how we should deal with those, so I think we will have to wait and see where it goes.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   As for infrastructure, as Matthew already said we will need to make some changes there.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   At the moment for example we don't have a per-architecture binary-all trees, which will be needed at some point.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
   At the moment we're mostly Linux (and i386) focused, because that's what most of our developers use
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   That might change in the future though, but we really can't predict that

<h2>Role of the Cabal</h2>

<hr>
Do some people or group of people have
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9909/msg01095.html">
influence or even power</a> that is outside the
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">constitution</a>? If so, is
it good? bad? What should be done about it, if anything? If these people don't
exist, what do we do to debunk the
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-9910/msg01412.html">
myth of the cabal</a>?
<hr>

<p><b>Wichert:</b> 
  Of course nobody has any power that is outside the constitution.
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  The `cabal'-theory suggests that a small group of people have (almost) complete power over Debian
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  What actually happens is that a small group of people spent a *lot* of time on Debian
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  As a result this group knows eachother very well, and is active any many areas of the project
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  That doesn't mean that it's a closed group or that it is a powerhouse
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  Anybody is free to join any area of the project, and we actively encourage people to do that
<br><b>Rob:</b>
   okay, we have hit time limit
<br><b>Wichert:</b> 
  you mean my time is up?
<br><b>Rob:</b>
  yes, three minutes

<p><b>Matthew:</b>
 Inevitably in an organisation the size of Debian, there will be people who meet with the DPL socially, and so might seem to be able to wield influence over them. In practice, it's a maturity issue for the DPL. I don't doubt that any of the candidates are sufficiently good people in this regard. As to the cabal, there are certainly some people who spend a lot of time on Debian, and/or a lot of time on irc, so may well reach a concensus amongst t
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 These others may consider that a "cabal" is running Debian.
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 Whether these people have any authority or not seems debatable. I don't see how one would quash the rumours of a cabal, though - many of the larger groups I'm involved in have a legendary cabal of some sorts.
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 In a group the size of Debian, accusations of clique-ism or cabals will always be present.
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 As long as there isn't really a cabal, then that's not a problem, IMO.

<p><b>Ben:</b>
     I think we all sort of agree on this issue...the theories and accusations will probably not completely go away, no matter what is done
     on one had, the real-time interaction between developers on IRC&lt; or in real-life, is a good thing...
     things get done rather quickly, and with little or no fuss...which feeds progress
     bogging things down with "politics" is usually not prefered
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     however, the downside is that this gives an air of "closed-door" policies
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     people feel left out...
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     so the end result will probably involve some sort of medium...
     and each case is different on what this medium is, and thus subject to opinions
     to be honest, I don't know how to keep this from reoccurring, but if I am DPL, I will work to reduce it

<hr>
<h2>Money, and Ideals</h2>

<hr>
The recent <a href="http://lwn.net/stocks/">run of IPOs</a> and startups has
made alot of capital available to the free software world. How should this
relate to Debian and its ideals of being a
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">free</a> and
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/debian-manifesto">technicaly
excellent</a> distribution? How much influence should commercial entities
(particularly those doing
<a href="http://opensource.corel.com/corel_linux_os.html">development on our
base</a>) have in the project?

<p>
and:

<p>
The Project has enjoyed a <a href="$(HOME)/News/1997/shuttle1">
successful past</a> but Linux is now
<a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-1546430.html?tag=st.ne.1002.bgif?st.ne.fd.gif.j">
nearly mainstream</a>. How will Debian react to this, and where is it headed
in the future, 1, 5 and 10 years from now?
<hr>

<p><b>Ben:</b>
     hmm..veryt broad question for 3 minutes :)
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     mainly I think we should just keep to our goals...provide a vast selection of software in the most stable format...
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     the minute we start to let commercial influences affect our decision making, is when Debian stops being Debian
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     we should simply recognize that we are more in the view of these entities, and not ignore them...just accept them as big groups of average users :)

<p><b>Wichert:</b>
   #include "BenC's comments"
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   we are already influenced by this
   we have seen people that want to become a Debian maintainer for the sole reason of being able to participate in an IPO
   We also benefit from it
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   Without this huge interesting in Linux and capital becoming available we wouldn't have the resources we have now..
   VA wouldn't hire 2 Debian developers fulltime for example
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   It also affects our developers, since some of then have benefited from their involvement in Linux or free software in general
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   I don't think it has influenced or will influence Debian itself though
   we are still all about making a free operating system as an open project
   and I don't see that changing us

<p><b>Matthew:</b>
 IMO, Debian will (and should) remain a volunteer organisation. That's the nature of what we are, and it's important. That way we can concentrate on making the best distribution, without worrying about commercial pressures.
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 To answer the question of how commercial entities should influence us - I don't think they should have more influence than normal users
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 I think the mainstream-ing (is that a word?) of Linux can only benefit us, in terms of attracting more competant developers (and hopefully money :) ) to the project
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 In 10 years time, I still see us as the best distribution in the World :)

<h2>Open Questions</h2>

<p><b>Rob:</b>
     fantastic
<br><b>Rob:</b>
     okay, we'll move on to the next stage
<br><b>Rob:</b>
     I apologize to everybody for the time; it's really a difficult thing to fit this all into a fixed format
<br><b>Rob:</b>
     we break for up to 10 minutes
<br><b>Rob:</b>
     during that period we'll unmoderate
<br><b>Rob:</b>
     please, candidates, be very quiet during the break :)
<br><b>Jason:</b>
    I will be posting the full topic list to the mailing list, we originally had 12 to ask
<br><b>Rob:</b>
    okay all....bearing in mind that at least one of our
          participants has time constraints (must leave in 15 minutes)
<br><b>Rob:</b>
    we're going to do two short time questions and then provide a
          brief summing-up
	  
<h2>KDE and Debian</h2>
<hr>
    Debian's current stance on KDE is to not include it.  The KDE
    programmers and other distributions have no problem with the
     license
    the way it is currently.  Should Debian change it's stance on
    the KDE
     licensing issue?
<hr>

<p><b>Matthew:</b>
 Well, AIUI, the problem is that some KDE stuff includes GPL
          code, yet the QPL isn't GPL-compatible
 There's been much discussion of this on -legal
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 My stance is that if it's OK to include it, we should include
          it. If it's not, then we shouldn't. Simple as that. I leave the
          licence experts to decide which is the case. What other distros do
          isn't relevant - we must do what is right, IMHO

<p><b>Wichert:</b>
   I can't do anything but agree
   Debian is all about free software, and we should not allow
   something like this to slip by
  if possible we should help them resolve these issues so everyone
  will benefit
  but it is a real problem at the moment

<p><b>Ben:</b>
     I think this is a real legal issue..., one which can't be
         decided on opinion alone
      I agree with matthew and wichert...but the solution isn't very
          clear and I am no lawyer :)

<h2>Release Cycle and Package Pools</h2>

<hr>
     What will you do to accelerate Debian's release cycle?
<br>
and:
<br>
             With debians growth and nearly 5000 packages it has
          become clear that it has
     outgrown the current package system. Also with the slow release
          cycles it seems
     that there are only "broken" and "obsolete" distributions.  My
          question then,  is
     if you would like to instate package pools (described at
          https://lists.debian.org/debian-project-9910/msg00052.html).
     And if not,  what other
    alternatives do you see fit?
<hr>

<p><b>Matthew:</b>
I've not looked at package pools in great detail (and dont' have time to do so in 2 minutes). As to release cycles, I think we need to allow less time between one release and the next freeze - so we can then have more frequent releases, without shortening the freeze time
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
Shorter times 'tween release and next freeze would get less bugs into the distro. With more attention payed to QA, we could get many people working specifically on the release targets for the next release to.
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
And less new things in a release would mean less bugs too - we have to get a balence between very frequent releases with very little new things in (one extreme which CD vendors will hate), and infrequent releases (with the previous distro rather out-of-date).
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
At the moment, the balence seems wrong to me, and I think a shorter release cycle would improve this.

<p><b>Ben:</b>
     I see the package pool structure as an enabling-technology (to coin a suit buzz-word, even though I hate them :), and faster releases as a result
<br><b>Ben:</b>
     how we achieve this is going to depend more on the inbetween, where we decide how to leverage this new structure
     as most know, Guy decided that package-pool was the way to head, and Jason and I have been working on trying to implent it using LDAP as the core repository...so things are progrws (slowly because of the current release taking time)
     after the pool is in place, we will need the ideas and work of other developers to leverage it
     s/progrws/progressing/

<p><b>Wichert:</b>
   as ben said work is already in progress on package pools, which seem like a really good idea to make it easier to play around with the release process
   our release manager already stated he would like to freeze quicker (iirc he mentioned 3 months after the release), which should help as well
   hopefully the combination of the possibilities and flexibility that package pools provide and a faster release cycle should  produce a better and more up to date distribution
   not all the focus needs to go to packaging and package systems though..
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   we need to shift the focus towards other areas such as active QA and documentation
   those are becoming more and more important, esp. with our growing userbase

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><b>Rob:</b>
 okay....now, with the permission of our candidates, we'll do one minute summaries of everybody's broad goals and views
 I'm going to just pick somebody to start, at this point it's hard to see that we've created any patterns :)

<p><b>Ben:</b>
      I hope that I have gotten the point across that I am more interested in internal Debian workings, than on outward views on Debian by others...
      I say that because I am a firm believer that you cannot change the way people view you by changing them, but more so by changing what you do...
<br><b>Ben:</b>
      if we concentrate on our work...it will pay off
      and others will recognize what we have and will do

<p><b>Wichert:</b>
   Over the past year I've learned a lot about how Debian works, and where it needs some improvement
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   hmm
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   this is hard :)
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   I think we'll need to realize that nothing everything is about producing packages
   and I'ld like to help Debian grow in other areas
<br><b>Wichert:</b>
   we already have a lot of people working on packages and technical issues, and that seems to be going quite well

<p><b>Matthew:</b>
 I want to keep Debian the best technically. At the moment this means dealing with the great expansion of Debian (which is a good thing, but brings its own problems). Communication seems to be the thing, and encouraging developers to consider things such as QA and documentation as well as packaging. I've experience of dealing with disparate groups of people such that they can work cohesively together,
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 particularly as various bits of debian begin to be run by groups of people who may not be involved in the other groups running bits of debian (if that makes any sense).
<br><b>Matthew:</b>
 Beyond that, Can I just encourage everyone to actually vote? turnout always seems rather small for DPL elections.
