#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Leadership Debate"

<h3>Date</h3>
The debate will be held on Tuesday, February 15, 2000 at 1900 UTC.

<h3>Where</h3>
<code>irc.debian.org</code> on channel <code>#debian-debate</code>

<h3>Format</h3>
24 hours before the debate each of the candiates will email their
'opening speech' to the debate organizer, Jason Gunthorpe. They
will then be placed on this page. Everything will be added at
the same time to ensure fairness.

<p>The actual debate will have two parts. First, a strongly moderated traditional
debate:
<ol>
<li>The moderator will ask a candidate a question. The candidate will
    then have a reasonable period to responed.
<li>After the response each of the other candidates will respond in turn.
<li>The first candidate will get to make closing remarks on the question.
<li>The order of the candidates is rotated for each question.
</ol>

<p>The second part of the debate is more freestyle. Questions submitted
by the audience and developers will be asked. Each candidate will get a
short period to respond.

<h3>Candidate Positions</h3>
The candidates are listed in the order of the nominations. In most cases there
is not a clear division between the announcement and the platform statement
so they are simply given as a numbered list.
