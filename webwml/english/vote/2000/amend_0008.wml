The text of the resolution should be replaced with a call for the
developers to resolve that:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1) the Debian project continues to acknowledge the utility of providing
     non-free software for it users.

  2) the Debian project also acknowledges that some developers may be
     unwilling or unable to explicitly work on non-free software, and
     holds that this is not and should not be detrimental to their work
     on the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, or their contribution to the
     Debian project.

  3) the Debian project considers equating the importance of the "contrib"
     and "non-free" areas described in the Social Contract with the
     official Debian GNU/Linux distribution inappropriate.

  4) noting that the Debian project already distributes various other
     collections of unofficial packages, the project endorses a move to
     specifically collect the various other add-on components such as
     "experimental", "orphaned", "non-free" and "contrib" and to clearly
     separate these from the "main" collection.
