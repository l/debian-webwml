  <h1>About me</h1>
   <p>Hi, I'm Marc Brockschmidt and was asked to run for DPL.</p>
  
   <h2>Not so ancient history</h2>
    <p>I was born 22 years ago, so there's not too much to tell. I'm currently
     studying computer science at the RWTH Aachen, planning to finish with my
     Diploma in the next two years, specialized in software modeling and
     verification. I'm also working as tutor at the RWTH (a job usually
     done by students in Germany, unlike other countries) and as a software
     developer and system administrator for <a href="http://credativ.de">
     credativ</a>.</p>
  
   <h2>Personal Debian stuff</h2>
    <p>I've started using Debian about 6 years ago and became a Debian developer
     in 2004. Since then, I have been involved in many parts of Debian.
     I've started helping out with the New Maintainer process in 2004, in which
	 I've been AM to dozens of people I now meet again in all parts of the
     projects. I also joined the NM Frontdesk at the beginning of 2005.</p>
   
    <p>Recently, most of my Debian time has been invested into the release team,
     which I joined in late 2006. This work has brought me into contact with
     even more maintainers and packages.</p>
   
    <p>Together with Andreas Barth and Martin Zobel-Helas, I am managing a
     network of hosts used for autobuilding, porting and other Debian-related
     services. I'm also part of the Debian Gnome and Perl teams (though I'm only
     seldomly active in the former and haven't been in active in the latter for
     quite a while due to my other Debian activities). I am also part of the
     lintian maintainer team and do work on it from time to time.</p>

  <h1>What I've experienced in Debian</h1>
   <p>I'm quite happy to say that I still love the Debian community, even after
    seeing so much of it. Through the community around our distribution, I've met
    quite a few people I nowadays consider to be friends. This, not the pride
    of being part of a group of people providing one of the leading operating
    systems, is the main source of my motivation to continue working on Debian.</p>
  
   <p>In my time, I have seen quite a few conflicts escalate, usually on mail
    or in IRC and only in a few, sad cases, these problems couldn't be discussed
    more reasonably in a face to face meeting. We should learn from this
    observation and perhaps try to emphasize the human component in discussions
    over modern media like electronic mail - always recite the one effective
    mantra in these cases: "Remember there are humans on the other side of the
    screen"</p>
  
   <p>The source of most of the recurring flame wars in Debian has been the
    performance of some core teams. In my involvement with both the NM process
    and the release team, I learned to appreciate the amount of work done
    by these people who are usually flamed down when something takes longer
    than expected. I agree, and often did so publicly in the past, with the
    general sentiment that these teams could do a better job, especially in
    pushing out information about their work, but I have to say that I'm unable
    to join in in the violent flaming that so often fills our mailing list
    archives.</p>
    
   <p>The development of tight-knitted groups of friends working together on
    some issue is normal and the exclusion and lack of communication with the
    outside is a regular phenomenon in such circumstances. This kind of
    behavior even gets stronger when the resources of such a group aren't
    enough to do all the work - it makes the time spent on their work
    more effective, but at the same time hinders fresh people to help out.
    This can hardly be solved from the outside - but a start would be to not
    defame these groups as "evil cabals" hindering the rest of the project
    out of spite.</p>
    
  <h1>Goals</h1>
   <h2>Things that can't be done</h2>
    <p>Before writing this platform, I had a look at the platforms of the past
     years and was amazed that nearly everyone talked about "improving
     communication", usually meaning that flaming shouldn't be allowed. I don't
     think this is possible - we can hardly replace all involved developers by
     cuddly stuffed animals. Good software developers have a strong opinion
     about topics dear to their heart, two good developers usually have two
     different opinions. Discussion, even bordering on flames, is OK - as long
     as it leads to a result.</p>

   <h2>Things that will be done</h2>
    <h3>Distribute information</h3>
     <p>The "Bits from ..." mails on debian-devel-announce seem to make a
      lot of people happy, so doing more of those seems like a good idea.
      This leads back to the problem of people not communicating ... Well,
      throw these facts and the few scraps of DPL authority together and
      you get a solution: The DPL or one of his delegates needs to pull
      the information from some teams and push it out to dda.</p>

    <h3>Present Debian better</h3>
     <p>People often need to present Debian to outsiders. For this, we have
      no common source of material, so let's create one. Possible content:</p>
      <ul>
       <li>(LaTeX) templates for slides</li>
       <li>current general information about Debian (number of packages,
        developers, release schedule, ... - all these bits of information
        that are available in thousands of different places)</li>
       <li>complete presentations to use as base</li>
      </ul>

     <p>This data can then be used to plug together the basis for a complete
      (individual) talk and save everyone a lot of work.</p>

     <p>We should also update the flyers usually handed out on conferences,
      some of them are awfully out of date - and while we are talking about
      conferences, there's much too learn of other projects, as not only
      <a href="http://gonzo.dicp.de/~he/blog/archives/33-Still-not-campaigning-for-DPL.html">I observed</a>,
      but also
      <a href="http://sam.zoy.org/blog/2008-02-24-bits-from-the-dpl-ftp-assistants-marketing-team-init-scripts-elections">Sam</a>. We should provide informational posters to be put on
      display on a booth, invest some money to be able to hand out Debian
      DVDs and make Debian look as accessible to non-hackers as it
      actually is. Providing the best distribution won't help if we aren't
      promoting it.</p>

    <h3>Make backports.org an official Debian service</h3>
     <p>backports have supplemented the Debian stable releases for quite
      some time now, their use is widespread under both desktop and server
      users. We should finally decide on the few missing bits (how to handle
      bug-tracking, for example) and make it an official Debian service,
      just like volatile. The change would only be small - not adding it to
      ftp.debian.org, but starting off with backports.debian.org pointing
      to backports.org. The current bpo team has done a wonderful job
      and should of course stay in charge.</p>

    <h3>Bring cool ideas and bored developers together</h3>
     <p>As <a href="http://gonzo.dicp.de/~he/blog/archives/30-What-to-do-when-Ive-collected-all-left-socks-or-what-I-want-to-change-in-Debian.html">I've written some time ago</a>, we should create a place
      where developers without time, but with good ideas for new software
      (extensions) can drop ideas, so that new people can pick them up
      and implement them. Nowadays, we do this once a year in the Debian
      Wiki, <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2008">collecting
      ideas</a> for the Google Summer of Code. We shouldn't need to
      wait for such an event.</p>

    <h3>Make participation for everyone on -devel possible again</h3>
     <p>debian-devel@lists.debian.org has been a high-traffic list for
      some time now and many contributors with limited resources don't
      follow it anymore for exactly this reason. This is bad, as -devel
      is supposed to be the list reaching all developers. There are two
      ways to solve this problem: Either split -devel into more than
      one list, or publish a digest of the most important discussions
      on a regular basis. Some time ago, Debian Weekly News did exactly
      this, so we might just need to find people interested in reviving
      that project.</p>
    
    <h3>Make www.debian.org nicer</h3>
     <p>The website of the Debian project is wonderful - it contains
      everything you ever wanted to know about Debian (and a few gory
      details you never wanted to hear about). The only, tiny little
      problem is that you usually aren't able to find what you need
      quickly, and if you do, you can never be sure that the data isn't
      outdated and there exists a more apt information source. This
      needs to be changed - updating and cleaning up the content on
      debian.org is far more important than changing the design (which
      should also be done at some point, for sure).</p>

    <h3>Be nice to the Debian ecosystem</h3>
     <p>There are a lot of Debian derivatives, the best-known being
      Ubuntu. We have seen quite a few discussion which ended in Debian
      developers flaming Ubuntu for various reasons - this should stop.
      Our derivatives exist because Debian provides an excellent, free
      basis. They are successful because Debian provides an excellent, 
      free basis - and they will stay to be around because of that. We
      need to accept this and try to work closer together with them,
      wherever it is useful. Duplicating work because we are too proud to
      accept that is simply a dumb idea.</p>

  <h1>The DPL's little helpers</h1>
   <p>The DPL job is quite time-consuming and I don't have much free 
    time. As that's a bad combination, I have planned on delegating
    quite a few tasks, especially the part of presenting Debian to the
    rest of the world at conferences. As I haven't had a chance to talk
    to all people I would like to work with, I won't give out an
    actual list in this platform.</p>

   <p>Some of the goals I listed above don't need to be done by the DPL
    (or even a full Debian Developer), so I will also try to integrate
    the efforts of non-DDs.</p>
