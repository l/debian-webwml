<h1>Steve McIntyre's DPL platform, 2008</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've been a Debian Developer since October 1996. I originally
joined to maintain the Debian version of mikmod; I was the upstream
developer at the time, and wanted the Debian version to work well
too. In those days, the NM process was rather simpler than today: I
installed Debian, then two days later I mailed Bruce Perens with a PGP
key and asked him for a Debian login. He responded almost immediately
with account details - I was in!</p>

<p>Since that point, I've worked on quite a wide range of packages,
some large and some small. Probably the most noticeable work I've done
for Debian is within the debian-cd team, both developing the debian-cd
software itself and using that same software to create the official
CDs (and now DVDs) that accompany each Debian release. I've been
involved with the CDs for almost every major and point release since
Hamm.</p>

<p>I host two of our buildds (ball and toffee), and help with local
admin work on two more (cats and grieg). I also keep my own little
farm of machines covering the majority of our architectures. This
helps me to debug problems in my own packages, and I give out accounts
to other DDs as well where helpful.</p>

<p>I have been a candidate in the DPL election for both of the last
two years, coming second in <a
href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_002#outcome">2006</a> and
<a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2007/vote_001#outcome">2007</a> by
a small margin each time. In 2006, Anthony Towns invited me to take up
a new delegated position of Debian "2IC", or Assistant Project
Leader. I accepted, and that year helped him with some of the duties
of the DPL: dealing with correspondence, talking to the press and
representing Debian at various Free Software gatherings.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Much of this platform will be familiar to people, as it is largely
based on what I said at this time <a
href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/93sam">last year</a>
and <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/platforms/93sam">the year
before</a>. Most of the things I want to work on in Debian have not
changed in that period: they are well known problems, issues that have
affected us for a long time. The two main ones that I see are:</p>

<h3>Communications within the project</h3>

<p>This is a long-term bugbear; DPL candidates have been promising to
work on improving communication within the project for as long as I
can remember. There are several places where communication has been
problematic in the past. Sometimes DPL effort has helped to fix
things, but more often there has been no visible improvement.</p>

<p>Simple, regular status updates from the various teams within the
project can help a great deal here. Equally, regular reports from the
DPL are needed to make sure that the Debian community are aware of
what is being said and done on their behalf. Even if some of these
reports consist purely of "Sorry, I've been busy in real life and not
accomplished much", simple confirmation that posts are not sitting
unattended is better than nothing. I aim to encourage these updates,
and if elected I will commit to distributing regular news from the
DPL.</p>

<p>Finally, I'm convinced that the more we talk about what we're
doing, the more motivated others will be to help us in our tasks. A
vibrant, open, friendly project depends on the periodic introduction
of fresh blood wanting to work with us. Let's make that easier!</p>

<h3>Working effectively; asking for help</h3>

<p>Continuing on from the previous point: another part of the DD's job
is to work effectively, both on individual packages and within the
project as a whole. This includes simple things like handling the bugs
in our packages in a timely fashion, but also includes bigger things,
such as considering the impact of changes on the release
schedule. Working effectively is not just important for our own
gratification; it also makes a major impact on how long we take to
release and the experience our users have with using Debian.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a key part of working effectively is honesty. We can
all suffer from a lack of time to do the jobs that we've promised to
do. After all, real life has a nasty habit of intruding on our
so-called "spare" time. So long as we don't let things delay too far,
we can cope and still contribute. But at some point, we need to be
more honest with ourselves and actually admit that we can't continue
with the jobs that we've promised to do. It's a hard thing to do, but
in a friendly community where we're all working together towards a
common goal there should be <strong>no</strong> shame in asking for
help.</p>

<p>In a larger scope, procedures exist for DDs to temporarily leave
the project if real life has overtaken them, and re-join when the
situation changes. Again, there is no shame in doing this - we should
be happy to acknowledge all the contributions that people have made to
Free Software when they could. But, still, many people don't take this
route and instead simply become missing in action (MIA). It can take
quite a while to pick up on DDs who have simply dropped out of the
project.</p>

<h3>How to fix these, aka "getting things done"</h3>

<p>I want to see improvements made where they are clearly
needed. There are cases where communications are lacking, or people
and teams might not be working as effectively as they want to or need
to. In those cases, I want to help and encourage the people involved
to make those improvements. If that is not enough, then we may need
stronger actions.</p>

<p>This goes for all of us, both as individuals and as a
project. Sometimes it can be all too easy to let nay-sayers slow us
down or discourage us from working on the projects that interest
us. If people are not contributing, ask them to help. If they don't
want to help, then ignore them and find others who will. Let's keep
Debian what it should be - a great, thriving community of people
having fun by working together on our shared goals.</p>

<h2>Why vote for me?</h2>

<p>I believe I can do a good job as DPL due to the following
qualities:</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>I've been a developer within Debian for over eleven years. I've
done large amounts of packaging work, I've seen Debian evolve a great
deal in that time, and I've been involved in lots of different
discussions. My time working as 2IC means I already have a good
insight into what the DPL job entails, and I'm happy I can do it.</p>

<h3>Organisation</h3>

<p>Besides packaging, I've done a lot of promotional work for
Debian. I've organised Debian stands at lots of shows and expos over
the years. I've been an admin and a mentor for Debian in the Google
Summer of Code for two years running and hopefully for a third:
fingers crossed! I ran the sponsorship team for Debconf 7 (and am
doing so again for Debconf 8), meaning I've been actively going out
and talking with a variety of companies and other organisations,
promoting Debian and asking them to support us publically. All of
these help raise awareness of Debian and its goals.</p>

<p>I've had a fair experience at "cat-herding" so far, including
arranging travel for groups to Debconf, FOSDEM and other events. I'm
currently the treasurer of the Debian UK Society, and I run the
debian-uk mailing list.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>I'm a programmer, which means I have strong opinions on many
subjects. (*grin*). Despite that, I believe I am honest, generally
approachable and easy to work with. I am a good communicator and
negotiator, and I have made many friends in the Debian and wider Free
Software Community over the years.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I have touched on some issues here that are hopefully not
surprising to most of our community. I must also acknowledge the fact
that the DPL mostly does not have the power to simply impose changes
as he/she sees fit. The best that the DPL can do here is to encourage
us to improve, sometimes by discussion and debate and sometimes by
leading by example. I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe I can
help us to achieve some of the goals I have listed here.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time in reading my platform, and I hope you will
support me in my goals.</p>


<h2>Rebuttals</h2>

<p>Again, I believe this year we have a selection of good
candidates. Despite having many fewer people standing in the election
than in recent years, we have possibly some of the best options
ever. I'd like to be DPL (obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be
standing!) but I'd also be happy enough to see any competent person
elected. I'm not going to engage in silly arguing with the other two
candidates, but here are my thoughts on them and their platforms:

<p><strong>Raphaël</strong> has a good history of contributing to
Debian, in lots of areas (alioth, debian-cd, dpkg, etc.) He is
(again!) pushing for a DPL team to do the job. I think that could be a
workable idea, but I'm not 100% convinced it's the best plan. Instead,
I'd be more keen to see the DPL delegate jobs as they're needed to
people with appropriate expertise rather than name a small team
up-front. Beyond that, I think his ideas for projects that the DPL
could help with are all sound. If elected, I'd be happy to work with
him on them where possible.</p>

<p><strong>Marc</strong> is another well-known and well-respected
Debian developer, currently working effectively as a part of our
release team. He may not have been around in the project as long as
Raphaël and I, but has seen and done enough to have a good feel for
how Debian works (and, indeed, the places where it could work
better). His list of improvements that he'd like to make all seem
reasonable and good things to do, but I don't see any really major
items here.</p>
