             We affirm that our Priorities are our users and the free

       </li>
       <li>
          <p>
              Given that we have known for two previous releases that
              we have non-free bits in various parts of Debian, and a
              lot of progress has been made, and we are almost to the
              point where we can provide a free version of the Debian
              operating system, we will delay the release of Lenny
              until such point that the work to free the operating
              system is complete (to the best of our knowledge as of 1
              November 2008).

              We acknowledge that there is a lot of progress in the
              kernel firmware issue; most of the issues that were
              outstanding at the time of the last stable release have
              been sorted out. However, new issues in the kernel
              sources have cropped up fairly recently, and these new

    <h2>Empower the release team to decide about allowing DFSG violations</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>
          <p>
              Debian's priorities are our users and free software. We
              don't trade them against each other. However, while
              getting a release out of the door, decisions need to be
              made about how to get a rock-stable release of the high
              quality Debian is known for, release more or less on
              time, and to minimize the usage of problematic
              software. We acknowledge that there is more than just
              one minefield our core developers and the release team
              are working on.
          </p>
       </li>
       <li>
          <p>
              We as Developers at large continue to trust our release
              team to follow all these goals, and therefore encourage
              them to continue making case-by-case decisions as they
              consider fit, and if necessary we authorize these
              decisions.

    <h2>Exclude source requirements for firmware (defined)</h2>
    <p>
        Firmware is data such as microcode or lookup tables that
        is loaded into hardware components in order to make the
        component function properly.  It is not code that is run
        on the host CPU.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately such firmware often is distributed as so-called blobs,
        with no source or further documentation that lets us learn how it works
        or interacts with the hardware in question.  By excluding such firmware
        from Debian we exclude users that require such devices from installing
        our operating system, or make it unnecessarily hard for them.

              firmware in Debian does not have to come with source.
              While we do prefer firmware that comes with source and
              documentation we will not require it,

              we however do require all other freedoms that the DFSG
              mandate from components of our operating system, and

     As per <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2008/11/msg00046.html">
     the request from the Debian Project Leader</a>, the voting and
     minimum discussion periods are one week long.
    </p>

    <vquorum />
     <p>
        With the current list of <a href="vote_003_quorum.log">voting
          developers</a>, we have:
     </p>
    <pre>
#include 'vote_003_quorum.txt'
    </pre>
#include 'vote_003_quorum.src'

    <vstatistics />
    <p>
      For this GR, as always 
      <a href="suppl_003_stats">statistics</a>
      shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements
      sent periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the
      list of
      <a href="vote_003_voters.txt">voters</a>
      would be made publicly available. Also, the
      <a href="vote_003_tally.txt">tally sheet</a>
      may also be viewed after to voting is done (Note that
	  while the vote is in progress it is a dummy tally sheet).
	  Until these are published, 
	  <a href='http://master.debian.org/~secretary/gr_lenny'>live stats</a>
	  are available.

    <vmajorityreq />
    <p>
      Amendments A (choice 2), B (choice 3), C (choice 4), and E
      (choice 6) supersede foundation documents, temporarily or
      permanently, and thus need a 3:1 majority. The Proposal (choice
      1) and Amendment D (choice 5) require a simple majority to pass.
