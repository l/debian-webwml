<h1>Platform for Wouter Verhelst</h1>
<h2>Why am I running for DPL?</h2>
<p>Hi. I'm Wouter Verhelst, and I'm running for DPL again. Yes, again,
since I first ran back in 2007, after Anthony's term. Not much has
changed for me personally since then. I moved&mdash;I now live in
Mechelen&mdash;and I got a few years older, but that's about it.</p>
<p>The same cannot be said about Debian, however. In three years, much
has changed. There has been a gradual replacement of people in role
positions in the project; people like James Troup, Ryan Murray, Manoj
Srivastava, and others, have stepped down from the position(s) they have
held, and handed their responsibilities over to others.  Sometimes this
went smoothly, sometimes not so smoothly. At any rate, I feel it is safe
to say that the new blood in role positions is doing a reasonable, if
not good or very good, job. It has been a long time since I last heard
people complain about the lack of communication from these teams; though
I should also add that I personally do not <em>perceive</em> an
important difference between communication as it happened then, and as
it happens now[<a href='#communication-foot'>0</a>].</p>
<p>Another old pain in the Debian community has been the time it took
us between releases. That, too, has been dealt with; our previous
"lenny" release took us far less time than some of the more problematic
ones in the past, and it looks like squeeze, while it may be somewhat
delayed from the initial planning, is not going to be delayed
forever, and is getting closer and closer.</p>
<p>So Debian's doing well, right?</p>
<p>Well, not necessarily.</p>
<p>Now that the old problems which have plagued us so long seem to have
been dealt with, it feels to me that people have lost focus somewhat.
This very DPL election is a very good example of what I mean: after the
record high of eight candidates in 2007's DPL election, 2008 had only
three. Last year's election had only two candidates; and this election
got very close to having only one candidate[<a
href='#candidate-foot'>1</a>]. This, I think, is a symptom of a loss of
interest and a loss of focus in the larger Debian picture, and it is
well past time we did something about that.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 2007, I ran on a <a
href='http://www.debian.org/vote/2007/platforms/wouter'>platform</a>
that was intentionally somewhat vague. This seems to have confused some
people into thinking that I was indecisive. I was not; instead, I wished
to outline what I thought the correct course of action was, without
committing myself too much to specific plans which in the end might turn
out to be impractical for one reason or another. Since I wish to avoid
the same confusion this time around, I will provide some more details of
my plans this year. However, do note that they are not set in stone; if
it turns out that some specific details of my plans cannot be executed
properly, I will not hesitate to change them. If you know something I
don't know and feel that parts or details of my plan are impossible to
execute, do not hesitate to let me know. The broad lines of what I wish
to accomplish will, however, not change.</p>
<p>First of all, I plan the usual things: I intend to communicate as
much as possible, and I intend to fund developer meetings wherever
possible, etc. Pardon me for the lack of emphasis on those points, but
for as long as I've been a debian developer, DPL candidates have
promised to be good at communicating. Yet, many if not all have failed
at doing so, and while I will do my best to be <em>at least</em> as good
as the average DPL in past years, I hold no hopes of being the
<em>best</em> DPL we've had in this area. As for the funding of
developer meetings, it feels to me that that's about the only thing we
can reasonably do with our money that has little chance of offending
anyone, so I see it almost as a no-brainer to do this, where and when it
makes sense[<a href='#money-foot'>2</a>]. Furthermore, I honestly don't
think that Debian's future hinges on whether the DPL communicates, or
what our money is spent on (though it does obviously have <em>some</em>
influence).</p>
<p>What I <em>do</em> think it hinges on is whether we continue to
receive outstanding technical contributions. Debian has long been[<a
href='#best-foot'>3</a>] the best volunteer-developed distribution out
there[<a href='#volunteer-foot'>4</a>], which meant that most people
interested in distribution development, but who were not prepared to
work for a commercial distribution (for whateve reason), were attracted
to Debian.  This is no longer true; not only are there other significant
volunteer-only distributions out there today (Gentoo springs to mind),
it is also true that most significant commercial distributions now have
(mostly) community-developed distributions. There's RedHat's Fedora,
Novell's OpenSUSE; and Ubuntu, too, has a community (the MOTUs) who do a
lot of development that goes directly into their distribution.</p>
<p>We could say that it is not important or relevant to us what happens
with other distribution communities, and to some extent that is true. We
could say that, on a technical level, Debian is still the best
distribution out there, and I certainly agree with that statement,
though I know plenty of people who do not.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, however, technical excellence does not create
itself, and if we wish to continue being technically excellent, we need
to continue attracting developers; I believe this is where Debian's main
challenges lie in the years ahead.</p>
<h2>How should we move forward?</h2>
<p>Debian is already having troubles due to the fact that there is more
competition out there for distribution development. Many important
packaging teams, including the xorg and libc ones, are or have been
badly short of manpower. There seem to be issues with the packaging of
the python interpreter, too[<a href='#python-foot'>5</a>]. Of course
these are just examples; there are more similar problems&mdash;some of
which, I'm sure, I'm not even aware of.</p>
<p>The only way to solve these problems is to get more people to
participate to Debian, and to keep motivating them so they keep working
on Debian where and when they can.
The best way to increase that influx of interested contributors is to
get more people interested in our distribution. And about the only way
to make <em>that</em> happen is to figure out what our problems are, as
perceived by not only ourselves, but also those who are <em>not</em>
part of our community, and to work on them. Thus, I intend to talk to
many people, both within the Debian community and outside of it, to find
out how we could improve. I don't expect that either I by myself, or the
Debian community as a whole, will be able to find a resolution for each
and every one of the problem areas that we will identify in this manner;
but I do expect that, by asking people to critically look at our
distribution, we will be able to identify blind spots of things that we
do not have (and that we are not aware of missing), or generic areas
that a lot of people are struggling with, and that we will be able to
prioritize what to work on&mdash;all on a voluntary basis, of
course.</p>
<p>So that's how to get people interested into Debian. As for how to
<em>keep</em> contributors: one of the more known pain points that still
exist within the larger Debian community, is that Debian isn't as often
as nice a place to be in as we could make it. While our mailing lists
aren't the same flaming hell that they used to be some years ago, we are
still a long way from what we could be[<a href='#flame-foot'>6</a>].
This is something we need to work on as a community, not only by stiving
to flames whereever and whenever possible, but also by politely
challenging people who do flame; and if elected, I intend to do just
that[<a href='#challenge-foot'>7</a>].</p>
<p>I believe these two steps will be important steps forward to improve
Debian as a whole, and I invite all of you to work with me towards that
goal.</p>
<p>Thank you for <del>listening</del> reading.</p>
<h2>Rebuttals</h2>
<h3>Stefano Zacchiroli</h3>
<p>Stefano's platform is, er, <em>long</em>. It looks like he's been
thinking a lot about running for DPL, and has done a lot of preparation.
He has set himself some rather ambitious goals; if he manages to achieve
them all, that would be quite an achievement.</p>
<p>Which is good, of course.</p>
<p>But I'm not convinced that will be easy; the DPL job is a demanding
one. Of course, I wish him all the luck.</p>
<h3>Wouter Verhelst</h3>
<p>Looks like this guy was a bit tired when he wrote his platform. It's
full of grammar and spelling errors.</p>
<p>Hang on, that'd be me.</p>
<p>Why, yes, I was.</p>
<h3>Charles Plessy</h3>
<p>Charles seems to identify some of the same problems in his platform
that I do in mine. But what he proposes to do in an effort to work on
these problems is vastly different.</p>
<p>Since I have recently (as in, less than a week ago) resigned as a
frontdesk member, I have a good understanding of how our current NM
process works. While the DM process seems to be working well, it is
certainly not true that all DDs are equal, and/or that all DDs can be
trusted to make a good judgement with regards to other people's
qualities.</p>
<p>This does not necessarily imply malice or incompetence; it simply is
a fact of life that some people are better judges of character than
others, and that whenever you have people who've been part of an
organization longer than others, there will be people with more
experience than others.</p>
<p>As such, I'm not convinced that handing DD status to someone based on
the statement of a single other DD is the best way forward. If the
average time it takes to go through the NM process is long, that is
mainly because there are so many applicants who apply (and are
advocated!) before they are <em>ready</em> to become a DD. Since unready
applicants slow down the process for everyone else, this is a bad thing,
and it is therefore that the NM process has become such a complicated
procedure. But frontdesk and the DAM have been happy on several
occasions now to fast-track applicants who so obviously were ready to
become DDs, waiving the requirements that are made in most cases, and
there is no reason to think that they're about to stop doing that any
time soon&mdash;on the contrary. In short, I don't think the NM process
is the problem.</p>
<p>On the release bits, I'll be short: No, the m68k port, to which I was
an active contributor, did not die because we had to build more packages
than we could; instead, it died because there was insufficient upstream
work being done on the port, and because we did not have the manpower to
do this work ourselves. For instance, there is <em>still</em> no libc
for m68k capable of thread-local storage, a requirement since glibc 2.3
or thereabouts. As a result, almost no modern software can be compiled
on m68k anymore.</p>
<p>Building high numbers of packages is just a scalability
issue; a problem that, worst case, can be solved by throwing money (for
hardware) at it. In contrast, getting and maintaining a working
architecture involves <em>far</em> more than just building packages; it
requires <em>people</em> to look at bugs, and fix them. This is why
attracting developers is far more important than redefining how we
decide which architectures to include.</p>
<h3>Margarita Manterola</h3>
<p>First of all, a confession: I am deeply happy that for the very first
time in Debian's history, a woman is running for DPL. Male dominance is
a big problem in the Free Software world; if Marga were to earn that
DPLship, that could be a very important step towards ending that
dominance, and I would be quite happy, if only for that fact.</p>
<p>But the key word in the above phrase is <em>earn</em>. While Marga
talks about a few things in her platform that all individually could be
good ideas, I'm not convinced that these are the things Debian needs
most at this point in time; what I lack in her platform is a sense of
vision. Therefore, I'm not convinced that she's the best candidate to be
next DPL&mdash;not yet, anyway.</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p><a name='communication-foot'>0</a> Before anyone misunderstands: that
wasn't meant as either criticism or praise; it's merely an observation.
<p><a name="candidate-foot">1</a> For most of the candidacy week, Stefano
Zacchiroli was the only candidate. I submitted my candidacy to avoid him
running alone, which I think would reflect bad on the project as a
whole; Charles' candidacy was a direct result of that. Marga submitted
her candidacy rather shortly before the submission deadline.</p>
<p><a name='money-foot'>2</a> Where 'makes sense' is probably defined
something like "I'll not be funding every possible and impossible
beer-drinking-excuse until we run out of money, but will not say no if I
feel that allowing a grant would help the project by helping someone
reach a meeting who would otherwise not be able to make it"</p>
<p><a name='best-foot'>3</a> Not that I think it isn't anymore, mind,
but the subject has become far more, er, subjective recently.</p>
<p><a name='volunteer-foot'>4</a> mostly by virtue of being the only
significant volunteer-developed distribution, I guess</p>
<p><a name='python-foot'>5</a> While it is no secret that I have an
irrational dislike for python and want as little to do with it as
possible, I do of course understand that python is an important language
in the free software world, and that without it we cannot have a proper
distribution. Also, while I understand there are problems with python
packaging, I do not currently pretend to understand the details. The
latter is a result of the former; clearly, however, if I do get elected
as DPL, I will not let any of that stand in the way of helping resolve
the issues, should that be necessary.</p>
<p><a name='flame-foot'>6</a> I do realize that we can't be a perfect
happy family. We aren't a family to begin with, and there is some
resentment within the community. However, I'm quite sure there is still
room for improvement.</p>
<p><a name='challenge-foot'>7</a> The alert reader will notice that I
have not done this all that often in the past, though I've been known to
<a
href='http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2004/04/msg00413.html'>try</a>.
This is because I feel that challenging someone on what is accepted in a
community as common-if-not-entirely-wanted behaviour, is not often a
very good strategy. However, if I were elected DPL with the explicit
statement (as above) that I <em>will</em> do this kind of thing (with my
prospective leader hat on), that would be something else.</p>
