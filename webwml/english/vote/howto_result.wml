	<P>The first line tells us how many votes were accepted and didn't contain
	errors.  (8 in the sample).  This count does not include ballots that were
	thrown out because they contained no vote, a mis-numbered vote or no PGP
	signature.
	
	<P>After that, each option is listed.  Under each option is any option is
	Dominates or ties as well as what the raw score is.  Raw score is strictly
	the number of ballots that prefer option A to Option B without taking any
	supermajority (such as needing 2:1) into account.  Also, the numbers might
	not add up to the number of valid votes (such as NONE dominates
	AMENDEMENT: 5+1=6 not 8) because some ballots might list both options as
	"no preference" (no number, Adam Klein's vote below would produce such a
	result).  Also, if there was a supermajority, it's possible for an option
	with a lower raw count to dominate or tie an option with a higher raw
	count.  For example:  Look at FURTHER DISCUSSION vs. AMENDMENT above.  If
	a supermajority of 3:2 is required, FURTHER DISCUSSION's 3 votes would be
	reduced by 3/2 (3*2/3=2) which would produce a tie.  If a supermajority of
	2:1 is required, FURTHER DISCUSSION's 3 votes would be reduced to 1.5 (a
	loss) when compared to AMENDMENT's 2 and AMENDMENT's 2 would be reduced to
	1 (also loss) when compared to FURTHER DICUSSION's 3.  Since neither can
	dominate the other with a supermajority, it's also a tie.

	<P>At the bottom of the RESULTS section is the outcome.  In this case, the
	"ORIGINAL PROPOSAL" won because it dominated every other option.  If it
	dominated every other option but failed to achieve the necessary Quorum,
	it would have been noted and the default option (last in the list) would
	have won.

	<H2>Explaination</H2>
	<P>After the voting results are announced, a list of the ballots recieved
	is given.  The list comes in two parts.  The first part lists the valid
	votes.  The second part lists the invalid ballots.

	<P>The first part comes in three columns.  The first column in the voter's
	email address, the second is the voter's name.  The last is the ballot.
	The ballot portion lists the order of preference for each option on the
	ballot.  Above this is a key that attempts to let you know what each
	column stands for.

	<P>The second part lists the voter's email address and name on one line
	and the reason his vote was rejected on the second.
