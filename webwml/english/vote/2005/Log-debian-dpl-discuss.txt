[07:00:25] <sanxiyn>	Does language count as one?
[07:00:25] <Valis-Nestrav>	nice question
[07:00:26] <gravity>	Altered a bit
[07:00:27] 	 * bdale fears his children have picked up much of his lingo...
[07:00:27] <joeyh>	ah, I like this one.
[07:00:29] <peterS>	I'm still waiting for the benefits of including a wider demographic in debian development circles
[07:00:31] <trave11er>	how many questions are there?
[07:00:43] <Valis-Nestrav>	Hehehehe... and only two minutes... ouch ;)

[07:00:58] 	 * gravity thinks it so cool that she's doing that
[07:01:04] <sanxiyn>	Obviously, Debian has high barrier against people with poor English.
[07:01:09] <Rhonda>	sanxiyn: Not as long as it's english. :)
[07:01:10] <dondelelcaro>	gravity: wasn't that at lwce boston?
[07:01:11] <jaldhar>	well for Indians, lack of bandwidth is a big barrier in participating in free software projects

[07:02:32] <sanxiyn>	Rhonda: Korean.
[07:02:44] <sanxiyn>	(Modern Korean, standard Seoul dialect, etc.)
[07:02:52] <bdale>	gravity: will do.  she's looking forward to it, but I fear I underestimated just how much attention she'd get from this.  the first zdnet.au article caught me by surprise.
[07:03:04] <Rhonda>	sanxiyn: AFAIK there are some developers in korea which should be more than just willing to help.

[07:03:51] <gravity>	bdale: Yeah, probably

[07:03:56] <peterS>	why did none of the candidates answer the question about what the benefits are to diversifying debian?  can it be that nobody can think of any benefits, but everyone is afraid to say"AFAICT it doesn't actually help debian to be heterogeneous"?
[07:03:58] <Zugschlus>	Mithrandir: no, ifupdown
[07:03:59] <irc_carrot>	coming

[07:04:25] <Mithrandir>	Zugschlus: ok; it seems to me that aj's style is doing development where NMUs are encouraged.
[07:04:29] <sanxiyn>	Rhonda: (met Changwoo Ryu and Yooseong Yang, for what it's worth)
[07:04:46] <changwoo>	keysigning is another barrier in some regions, aprt from the language barrier
[07:04:51] <Manoj>	Hmm. how do we handle a dpl resignation?

[07:04:59] <gravity>	dato: ;-)
[07:05:01] <sanxiyn>	Rhonda: To be frank, BTS even doesn't *display* euc-kr encoded mail correctly.
[07:05:07] <Rhonda>	sanxiyn: Developer's should be able to deal with not too good english in bugreports anyway, so it might not be your problem, as long as you try.
[07:05:11] 	 * sanxiyn should have reported that as bug against bts.
[07:05:11] <plypkie>	peterS: if there's a hugely skewed demographic to debian, then perhaps debian is missing out on the valuable inputs of all those who feel unable to participate
[07:05:21] <slef>	Manoj: with difficulty?
[07:05:24] <Rhonda>	sanxiyn: You can still do it. :)
[07:05:31] 	 * enrico appreciates "I am accustomed to controversy"
[07:05:33] <sanxiyn>	Rhonda: It's a high barrier. Don't underestimate language barrier.
[07:05:35] <enrico>	No doubt on that
[07:05:36] <peterS>	plypkie: that's the usual line.  I know, I've heard it.  I just wonder if anyone can point to any evidence that this actually happens

[07:06:11] <peterS>	plypkie: obviously there are things that the 6 billion people in the world who aren't debian developers could possibly contribute.  but is it more likely that a demographically balanced set of them would contribute more than a homogeneous set?

[07:30:45] <Rhonda>	vorlon: Feel free to bug http://dict.leo.org/  :)
[07:30:50] <gravity>	sanxiyn: True, although things still do erupt
[07:30:53] <slef>	womble: please be less graphic.
[07:30:54] <womble>	migus: Or we could have a debate and discussion instead of the candidates all patting each other on the back
[07:30:55] <Loevborg>	sanxiyn, it's true!
[07:30:56] <joeyh>	ie, debian-boot (which is not too small, but is focused) has had one flamewar in the past 2 years.
[07:30:57] <jaldhar>	loevborg: usually I've only needed to search by package and debbugs is adequate for that.  bugzilla etc. is just overkill
[07:31:03] <kylem>	martin_krafft_, i think this is fine, it will be much more readable later with a bit of cleaning up, but i think this is the best that can be done.
[07:31:04] <enrico>	JW is doing a really good job of channeling all attention on him
[07:31:08] <Rhonda>	vorlon: I'm no native speaker, so I can't tell.
[07:31:13] <gravity>	martin_krafft_: Answer + Rebuttal Phase!

[07:31:17] <gravity>	martin_krafft_: Two parts

[07:31:52] <Loevborg>	jaldhar, I'm not saying bugzilla is the answer (although it is better)
[07:32:00] <womble>	peterS: *L*WN...
[07:32:05] <gravity>	joeyh: I really think -boot is special though. It's like a haven of sanity in an insane project
[07:32:06] <peterS>	womble: oh, right
[07:32:08] <Manoj>	but the smaller groups also tend to be more technical, and less likely to deal with objective, far reaching issues

[07:37:27] <kandinski>	I think worse than flamewars are low-level frames that last for hundreds of posts

[07:39:08] <Manoj>	sanxiyn: hell no. legal is pretty decent for performing analysis of licenses
[07:39:10] <gravity>	sanxiyn: Among others
[07:39:34] <kylem>	sanxiyn, -legal is very useful. some of it's analysis just aren't popular. this isn't their fault, it's the project's for being inflexible.
[07:39:36] <Manoj>	sanxiyn: indeed, they are our domain experts, such as we have, on those issues
[07:39:38] <sanxiyn>	Manoj: I just claimed that sizeable number of developers believe otherwise (regardless of fact)
[07:39:47] <gravity>	The problem isn't -legal's legal advice, it's -legal's DFSG interpretation
[07:40:12] <Manoj>	sanxiyn: and I am saying that is not a fact -- depending on how you define "sizable"
[07:40:21] <sanxiyn>	Okay.

[07:48:20] <kylem>	Manoj, "(1) Parliament or the legislature of a province may expressly declare in an Act of Parliament or of the legislature, as the case may be, that the Act or a provision thereof shall operate notwithstanding a provision included in section 2 or sections 7 to 15 of this Charter."
[07:48:22] 	 * joeyh would love to learn who put that BS on www.d.o
[07:48:27] <gravity>	joeyh: :-)
[07:48:31] <Manoj>	joeyh: that was bruces idea, was it not?
[07:48:40] <peterS>	"universal means different things to different people."  in other words, there is no universal definition of universal.  cute.
[07:49:11] <Manoj>	kylem: uymm, this is too late at night for me to understand language like that
[07:49:12] <gravity>	A few years ago we were known for our easy install too? When was this?
[07:49:14] Part	snakeru has left this channel. ()
[07:49:16] <gravity>	Probably well before my time
[07:49:25] <Adrinael>	Probably when Debian had 1 package
[07:49:27] <dato>	mmm, do you think candidates will continue for a while here after the official debate?
[07:49:30] <dato>	some of them, at least?
[07:49:31] <Manoj>	gravity: post SLS.
[07:49:35] <dondelelcaro>	dato: possibly
[07:49:41] <sanxiyn>	Hm, didn't know XSF's repository server ran unstable.
[07:49:45] <peterS>	gravity: yeah, mid-90s it was an easy install compared to the alternatives
[07:49:45] <gravity>	Manoj: Yeah... a little before me
[07:49:45] <Manoj>	when I installed debian, it was the easiest install around
[07:49:47] <kylem>	Manoj, the canadian government, either federal or provincial, can declare that a part of our bill of rights is inactive by act of parliament.
[07:50:24] <Manoj>	kylem: oh. no constitutional amendment required?
[07:50:26] <sanxiyn>	Manoj: Oh, so there was such time...
[07:50:34] <kylem>	Manoj, correct.
[07:50:47] <hacim>	Question for candidates: In what way do you think Debian can honor the labor contributions of non-DDs who do significant work for the project (e.g. translators)?
[07:50:58] <Hydroxide>	Manoj: it makes an exception for 5 years, with renewal necessary if it is to be continued
[07:51:29] <migus>	hacim: improvement have been made through the nm- proccess
[07:51:33] <sanxiyn>	hacim: Well, there are also enough people maintaining (sometimes important) packages and in NM...
[07:51:35] <Hydroxide>	Manoj, kylem: and to the best of my non-canadian knowledge, the politicians are pretty much loath to use that power, and the few times it has happened it has been undone
[07:51:40] <peterS>	hacim: good question.  in other words, how to take some of the wind out of the mythos that a @debian.org address is the only achievement one should be striving for
[07:51:43] <kylem>	Hydroxide, well duh.
[07:51:52] <kylem>	Hydroxide, how many times has the US declared martial law? :)
[07:52:05] <kylem>	Hydroxide, the only time i can think of was the FLQ crisis in 196X
[07:52:07] <sanxiyn>	peterS: Getting mentioned on the changelog? :-)
[07:52:24] <Hydroxide>	kylem: well, even without your notwithstanding clause, I think basic freedoms are greater in canada than the US right now
[07:52:27] <smurfix>	kylem: Doesn't need such a declaration to suspend lots of rights
[07:52:28] 	 * joeyh notices that he now has a space-bar reflex to pause noninteractive things he's watching.. like debates
[07:52:28] <joeyh>	pity it doesn't work, didn't someone mention breaks?
[07:52:32] <kylem>	Hydroxide, you don't typically get to be government for long when you revoke rights of your citizens. ;-)
[07:52:32] <peterS>	sanxiyn: yeah, that's status quo.  I'd agree with hacim that more public acknowledgement of people who do the work would be nice
[07:52:45] Join	XinmingLai_ has joined this channel. (XinmingLai@60.180.94.242)
[07:52:52] <hacim>	sanxiyn: I'm talking about people who contribute to heavily to the project but aren't considered "part of debian"
[07:52:56] <kylem>	Hydroxide, that's true. you're guaranteed more in the charter.
[07:53:08] <kylem>	smurfix, yeah.
[07:53:10] <dondelelcaro>	kylem: I don't think it's been declared nation wide in quite some time... in specific areas it may have been implemented.
[07:53:32] <migus>	hacim: I know people in the situation you are describing.
[07:53:33] <gravity>	I thought everyone credited their translators in the changelogs
[07:53:36] <kylem>	dondelelcaro, i'm having a hard time thinking of any time where it would have been (but i've never taken a US history class) :)
[07:53:41] 	 * enrico goes to work
[07:53:42] <Manoj>	joeyh: we've had the break that was mentioned
[07:53:58] <sanxiyn>	gravity: I think peterS is saying that something more than changelog mention may be motiviating.
[07:54:06] Quit	enrico has left this server. (Client Quit)
[07:54:06] <dondelelcaro>	kylem: about the only times I can think of would be in civil war times and/or 1812... and even then, it's imposed in very specific locales.
[07:54:13] 	 * sanxiyn is just fine with changelog though.

[07:54:35] <sanxiyn>	gravity: Indeed.
[07:54:40] 	 * hacim contemplates @i18n.debian.org addressses and voting power, but no upload ability
[07:54:45] <gravity>	Unless you want your blog syndicated to planet Debian. Hell, even Simon Law was on there for a whiel
[07:54:46] <kylem>	gravity, only when we fuck shit up. :)
[07:54:50] <sanxiyn>	hacim: Oh.
[07:54:54] <gravity>	kylem: Right :-)
[07:55:07] <migus>	hacim: is that so hard to join the project and maintaining a few packages ?
[07:55:13] <gravity>	WOOHOO to DWN Features!
[07:55:31] <jaldhar>	hacim: they should get @scc.debian.org addresses
[07:55:31] Quit	TCW has left this server. (Remote closed the connection)
[07:55:32] <Rhonda>	hacim: I think that's a sensible suggestion. Could you raise it on debian-project@lists?
[07:55:33] <slef>	gravity: ?
[07:55:34] <sanxiyn>	migus: Yes, currently.
[07:55:47] <kylem>	wtf
[07:55:51] <kylem>	translators getting email addresses?
[07:55:59] <gravity>	slef: I'd suggested adding feature articles (tutorials and such) to DWN to make it more than just the weekly news
[07:56:01] <Rhonda>	migus: Is that so hard to not force everyone who wants to contribute something to maintain a package?
[07:56:05] <gravity>	slef: It's cool to see someone else with the idea
[07:56:05] <kylem>	i agree they are important and should be recognized, but that's kind of extreme.
[07:56:20] <migus>	Rhonda: you are right :)
[07:56:22] <sanxiyn>	kylem: I think GNOME project gives translators CVS commiting right.
[07:56:24] <gravity>	Yeah... easy access to projects via alioth should be plenty
[07:56:30] <Manoj>	kylem: should they be full developers instead?
[07:56:38] Quit	nota has left this server. (Client Quit)
[07:56:39] <gravity>	sanxiyn: Well, that doesn't need an @debian.org
[07:56:50] <kylem>	Manoj, why would they need to be, if we're just giving them a mail alias.
[07:56:57] <Rhonda>	kylem: It's a sensible thing to do. They contribute quite often _MUCH MORE_ than $joe_random Debian Developer.
[07:57:03] <hacim>	Rhonda: it was raised at the last debconf some, but it would be good to bring it up again for discussion
[07:57:11] <kylem>	Rhonda, it's only an issue if you don't speak english. ;-)
[07:57:41] Quit	xjzzx has left this server. (Remote closed the connection
[07:57:44] <womble>	How would someone go through NM completely anonymously?
[07:57:48] <Manoj>	essentially the question comes down to when should some one be enfranchised in debian
[07:57:56] <kylem>	Rhonda, i also think $joe random loser needs to be expunged for the project if they're not contributing.
[07:58:20] <kylem>	Rhonda, maybe the best thing is to take ubuntu's dealie for translations when it's ready to be free.
[07:58:23] <dato>	so JW to NM, now.
[07:58:30] <dato>	he agreed to it.

[07:58:52] <womble>	gravity: How would you pass the ID check?  *Someone* would have to know who you really are
[07:58:56] Quit	_pronik has left this server. (Remote closed the connection)
[07:59:04] <womble>	The AM couldn't know, so a couple of other DDs would have to sign the fake key
[07:59:06] <gravity>	womble: Good point.
[07:59:07] <dondelelcaro>	womble: actually, rather easily... since you could sign your fake key...
[07:59:22] <womble>	dondelelcaro: But you need other sigs and such to pass ID check now
[07:59:24] <Manoj>	a developer who maintainns a package has stood up and taken responsibility for a fraction of the finished product; in units that the product is distributed and tracked in: a package.
[07:59:25] <bab>	ooo, this is a fun question
[07:59:30] <sanxiyn>	womble: I think it's not possible to pass anonymously in sane way.
[07:59:49] <gravity>	bab: Yeah. This is the best one yet :-)
[07:59:50] <dato>	fwiw, there are jokes that I'm a "virtual" personna of jordi.
[08:00:01] <dondelelcaro>	although, in most cases, you can go through the NM templates yourself, and ask an AM if you have specific questions.
[08:00:03] <Hydroxide>	this isn't really a fair question, although I want to see what JW's answer is
[08:00:04] <womble>	Not to mention that you'd have to maintain packages or do something else useful as your pseudonym in order to get through.
[08:00:04] <vorlon>	martin_krafft_: too late for another question?
[08:00:06] <dato>	because only he knows me IRL, nobody else.
[08:00:07] <sanxiyn>	dato: Are you?
[08:00:08] <martin_krafft_>	try it.
[08:00:11] <martin_krafft_>	vorlon: ^^
[08:00:20] <vorlon>	martin_krafft_: what do you believe is the minimum level of activity that should be expected from DDs?
[08:00:23] <Rhonda>	dato: Me being accused of being Joey (Schulze). :)
[08:00:27] <dato>	sanxiyn: the answer will always be, 'no!'
[08:00:27] <gravity>	GO GUS!
[08:00:36] <womble>	gravity +1
[08:00:44] <kylem>	Rhonda, i'm sorry, now that i reflect on it, mail alias + voting would probably be a good idea for high volume translators.
[08:00:54] <slef>	AngusLees++ for honesty, -- for diplomacy
[08:01:04] <Rhonda>	kylem: :)
[08:01:11] <biella>	best moment in the debate goes to angus
[08:01:12] <helix>	slef: heh
[08:01:18] Part	adamhall has left this channel. ()
[08:01:25] <kylem>	Rhonda, a metric would need to be established for keeping people active though, since it would be fairly easy for a translator to do say a 100, get their alias, then fade to obscurity.
[08:01:44] <joeyh>	hmm, andreas didn't answer did he?
[08:02:13] <sanxiyn>	kylem: Yes, translator continuity is a problem indeed.
[08:02:15] <Hydroxide>	more interestingly, JW didn't
[08:02:16] <dondelelcaro>	Rhonda: I'd be a little wary about the voting though, unless they had gone through the P&P part of NM, though.
[08:02:22] <Rhonda>	kylem: You mean...  Like people coming in with a package and doing no upload after they got their account? :)
[08:02:24] <joeyh>	hmm, yes
[08:02:29] <Rhonda>	kylem: It's not like that isn't happening.
[08:02:31] <vorlon>	martin_krafft_: *should* expect from DDs, not *can* expect from DDs
[08:02:32] <kylem>	Rhonda, yes, exactly.
[08:02:53] <peterS>	dondelelcaro: indeed, it's not like P&P is discriminatory against people who can't hack it as real maintainers
[08:02:53] <kylem>	Rhonda, granted, i don't think anyone should lose their mail alias ever. voting priviledge should definitely be tied to activity though.
[08:03:01] <kylem>	(i'm annoyed when i lose email aliases. ;)
[08:03:01] <peterS>	as opposed to T&S
[08:03:07] <martin_krafft_>	vorlon: sorry... i suck.
[08:03:07] <dato>	martin_krafft_: can you ask JW and Andreas to answer, perhaps, the who would you vote question?
[08:03:09] <Rhonda>	dondelelcaro: DPL voting, at least.  Might be discussed about technical issues, granted.
[08:03:10] <vorlon>	aw, no real discussion on that point anyway, alas.
[08:03:20] Part	nobse has left this channel. ()
[08:03:25] <vorlon>	martin_krafft_: it's ok, the candidates' answers would probably have been lame anyway :)
[08:03:29] <slef>	vorlon: tail-end.
[08:03:43] <dondelelcaro>	Rhonda: yeah, the technical issues and changing project directions are the real things I'm worried about...
[08:03:45] <jvw>	I try to make a point of detecting inactive people before they actually hurt the project by neglectance of packages...
[08:03:52] <dato>	martin_krafft_: thanks
[08:04:22] <jaldhar>	we need something like the old karma report.  Though with better heuristics
[08:04:22] <sanxiyn>	"I'm willing to upset some people in order to make things better for everyone else"
[08:04:29] <sanxiyn>	Indeed.
[08:04:47] 	 * gravity chuckles at aj
[08:04:48] <Manoj>	the old karma report was a farce
[08:05:02] <vorlon>	slef: indeed
[08:05:08] <jvw>	jaldhar: karma report was really something I very dislik
[08:05:13] <slef>	Manoj: did someone refer to it?

[08:05:24] <jaldhar>	Manoj: yes true.  I was #1 just by adding new webmin modules :)

[08:14:37] <joeyh>	hurrah for irc!
[08:14:44] <slef>	that seems to have been a running theme today :-/
[08:14:44] <peterS>	it's ok, we know what it means
[08:15:02] <part>	could replace the "debate takes place" with "debate over"
[08:15:04] <peterS>	slef: yeah, people confuse 'line-based interface' with 'paragraph-based interface' frequently, it seems
[08:15:07] <mjg59_>	slef: Lots of the current topic could be dropped

[08:16:24] <bdale>	gus: is he on the LCA agenda, or do you know offhand?
[08:16:41] <gus>	oh well. i can't see mbp without being reminded of whip marks anyway (story i don't intend to tell involving one of raster's parties..)
[08:16:45] <gus>	bdale: dunno..
[08:16:53] <aj>	bdale: he's on the papers ctte
[08:16:55] <bdale>	gus: no worries, I can look as easily as you can
[08:17:05] <bdale>	aj: oh, right, I knew that
[08:17:06] <aj>	bdale: we can draft him into giving a talk at deb miniconf surely at least
[08:17:17] 	 * mjg59_ is going to LCA
[08:17:19] <aj>	bdale: i think that remains unscheduled as of yet
[08:17:21] <bdale>	aj: would be interesting to have an update in some context
[08:17:26] <mjg59_>	(woo!)
[08:17:29] <bdale>	mjg59_: cool.  it's fun.
[08:17:36] <peterS>	it sounds like fun
[08:17:39] <mjg59_>	bdale: Yeah, I'm looking forward to it
[08:17:45] <bdale>	aj: been trading email with Oxer about it, actually
[08:17:48] <mjg59_>	Need to get flights organised - at least I've got somewhere to stay now
[08:18:02] 	 * bdale will have the entire family along this year
[08:18:10] <aj>	bdale: half of them presenting, no less...
[08:18:18] <bdale>	aj: well, that too
[08:18:21] <mjg59_>	(Incidentally, if anyone has any followup questions they'd like to ask me in realtime, feel free to now - otherwise I'm going to start considering going back to bed...)
[08:18:26] <peterS>	the few thousand dollars of spare change never seems to land in my lap, so I can never actually make it to a LCA, but that's definitely a priority if I ever do strike it rich

[08:19:03] <gus>	bdale: heh. so is she putting you on the "father's programme" or something? ;)
[08:19:10] <gravity>	slef: Very nice. Thank you.
[08:19:23] <peterS>	bdale: oh, indeed.  if only I had anything to say that dozens of other people don't already know how to say better (:

[08:20:15] <mjg59_>	vorlon: I intend to sleep. If people feel that I am devoting insufficient time to my waking or sleeping hours, I will summarily ignore them.
[08:20:29] <slef>	thanks to the logger... automatic edit/reformat suggestions welcome... copy the html version whereever you want in my opinion
[08:20:43] <sanxiyn>	mjg59_: What color of rainbow do you like?
[08:20:45] <bdale>	hrm.  I think this will be my fourth LCA?  first was Brisbane.
[08:21:06] <dondelelcaro>	sanxiyn: I find 652.3nm to be a pleasing color
[08:21:17] <peterS>	dondelelcaro: good answer
[08:21:21] <aj>	bdale: brisbane, perth, adelaide, now canberra; you missed sydney, and CALU in melbourne
[08:21:27] <gus>	mjg59_: you could form a "sleeping team". project slumber could all take turns sleeping, with the DPL being allowed to tell any of them that they're snoring too loudly

[08:21:53] 	 * slef changes some colours, if he can remember how
[08:22:11] <aj>	we could try synchronised sleeping -- sleeping in sync with anything would be pretty novel for most debian types...
[08:22:37] <bdale>	aj: hey, now, just because it's true...
[08:22:38] <mjg59_>	It's vital that teams tell the rest of the project when they're going to be asleep.
[08:22:44] <kandinski>	hmmm
[08:22:47] <Rhonda>	aj: I rather like to see sleep as background process.
[08:23:00] Quit	martin_krafft_ has left this server. ("leaving")
[08:23:04] <gus>	aj: but getting everyone to sleep at the same time would be too hard, so you'd have to kick most of them out of bed before you could claim it was a reasonable goal

[08:31:20] <helen>	Manoj: I am going to make a more organised summary of the -debate log, but I think we need to post the original to the vote webpages too

[08:32:28] <helen>	Manoj: I'll email you mine in a minute

[08:33:35] <dato>	helen or madduck, will you request feedback about the debate? e.g., I think some people liked the second part quite much, so perhaps they want to request moreemphasis in live discussion for next year.

[08:34:05] <dato>	Manoj: ^ was it because of the second part?

[08:35:25] <peterS>	cmot: as the years go by maybe we'll collate them into a collection of dpl-debates in a single package.  like linux gazette does now
[08:35:51] <Zugschlus>	peterS: you need to get that package past ftpmaste
[08:35:59] <Zugschlus>	and it will never be in stable in time
[08:36:05] <Manoj>	I'll probably put them up on vote.d.o tomorrow (I hatge doing serious work after shooting the glad juices, since I am not supposed to operate heavy machinery)
[08:36:07] <Zugschlus>	a classic candidate for volatile
[08:36:08] <cmot>	Is it really DFSG-free?
[08:36:27] <peterS>	Zugschlus: like AnthonyTowns, I have total confidence in the way the ftpmaster post is being handled
[08:36:53] <aj>	you'd be better off putting them in debian-history, than introducing a NEW package anyway
[08:36:54] <sanxiyn>	cmot: haha
