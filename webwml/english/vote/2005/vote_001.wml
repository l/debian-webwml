              The debates this year were orchestrated by Helen
              Faulkner and Martin Krafft.  I would like to extend the
              thanks of the project for their stellar work in
              producing an exemplary debate, despite a record number of 
              candidates participating this year. A
              <a href="Log-debian-dpl-debate">transcript</a>
              of the debate is available for review
            </p>
	    <p>
	      The debate was held on March 16<sup>th</sup>, 06:00:00
	      UTC, 2005, on the IRC server <kbd>irc.debian.org</kbd>.
	      There were two relevant channels, namely,
	      <em>#debian-dpl-debate</em>, and
	      <em>#debian-dpl-discuss</em>. The
	      <em>#debian-dpl-debate</em> channel was moderated, but
	      open to anybody who wished to view the proceedings, but
	      only the candidates, the moderators, and those
	      participating in the immediate discussion will be able
	      to post messages. The <em>#debian-dpl-discuss</em>
	      channel was unmoderated - the intention was for
	      real-time, unmoderated discussion of the candidates'
	      responses to the debate questions.
	    </p>	    
	    <p>
	      Raw logs from the channels, in addition to the
              <a href="Log-debian-dpl-debate">transcript</a>

	     shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements sent

             placeholder). Please remember that the project leader
             election has a secret ballot, so the tally sheet is
             produced with the hash of the alias of the voter rather
             than the name; the alias having been sent to the
             corresponding voter when the acknowledgement of the
             ballot was sent so that people may verify that their
             votes are correct.

             <p>
               Debian uses the Condorcet method for project leader
               elections. Simplistically, plain Condorcet's method
               can be stated like so : <br/>
               <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
                  The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
                  candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
                  race with that candidate.
                </q>
                The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
                be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
                and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
                various means of resolving the tie. See
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
                for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
                <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
                specifically, § A.6.
