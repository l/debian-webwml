    <h1 class="title">Platform for Angus Lees</h1>


<h2>Who is Angus Lees?</h2>

<p>
Most of you have probably not heard of me.  I became a Debian
Developer in 2000 after using Linux since 1995.  I am 28 years old and
married with 3 children.  I work as a developer for a small company
which produces Debian-based managed routers.  I maintain a handful of
Perl packages, the most popular being Defoma; but I'm not the original
author so please don't hold that against me.
</p>

<p>
I try not to spend too much time on email or IRC, hence my low profile
amongst Debian internationally.  In Australia, however, I try to meet
people whenever I can and I have given presentations at past <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/miniconf3/">Debian miniconfs</a>, and
other Debian-au events.  I would like to think that most Australian
Debian Developers could put a face to the name.
</p>

<h2>Why am I running for DPL?</h2>

<p>
Every year each DPL candidate enumerates the problems with Debian and
puts forward grand solutions they promise to implement as DPL.
Following each of these is usually a discussion pointing out that the
DPL position doesn't really carry any direct powers and also that
almost all of these solutions can be implemented just as easily by the
average Debian Developer.  In fact, the constitution says directly
that the DPL should represent the project's views and not push their
own agenda.
</p>

<p>
The DPL's primary function as I see it is to act as a
figurehead&mdash;a single point of contact to present Debian to the
outside world.  Consequently, I see the most important qualities of a
good project leader to be availability, written and spoken language
skills, personality and experience being a Debian Developer.
</p>

<p>
I feel particular issues are best dealt with by developers closer to
the problem or through the appointed committees and delegates.
Amongst other things, I have a few ideas about how to improve
communication within Debian and I will try to bring an attitude of
tolerance and more efficient communication to the mailing lists.  My
hope is that this will allow the larger issues, such as freeness, to
be dealt with more easily.  In general however, I feel Debian mostly
works and I am <em>not</em> running for DPL because I expect the
position will grant me the authority to change it.
</p>

<p>
I am a reasonable public speaker who can communicate the processes,
ideals and character of Debian to others.  I am independent&mdash;I
don't get involved in flame-wars, have not tied myself to any
particular faction within Debian, nor do I work for a company with a
significant interest in Debian.  I get along easily with people and I
have experience with the management of volunteer organisations.
</p>

<p>
In short, I am running for DPL because I believe I can do a great job.
</p>

<h2>But what do you think about &hellip; ?</h2>

<p>
Now having said that, I realise that you can't trust someone you can't
predict and no-one is going to vote for someone they can't trust.  So
to provide some background, I'll discuss what I think about a few
Debian issues.  As I've pointed out above, I don't necessarily have
good solutions to these and I certainly don't expect to use any DPL
privileges to push any particular agenda.  To make it clear that these
should not be directly relevant to the DPL election, I've put them on
<a href="https://people.debian.org/~gus/debian-thoughts.html">a
separate page</a>.  I'm happy to add or expand on anything there if
anyone thinks my opinion would affect their vote.
</p>

<p>
I may not post to the Debian lists often, but I follow issues on
Debian and SPI mailing lists and often discuss matters with other
Debian developers over beers.  If you look at the lively discussions
on the Debian mailing lists, you'll see the same dozen or so names
repeated again and again but you'll rarely see mine.  I believe I am
able to represent the &ldquo;silent majority&rdquo; of Debian
developers, which follow a line somewhere in the middle, think Debian
is generally on the right track and just want to get on with doing a
good job.
</p>

<h2>Vote Angus Lees for DPL</h2>

<p>
Keeping in mind the realities of the DPL position, I hope you will
vote based on ability and suitability and not simply familiarity.
</p>

<h2>Rebuttal</h2>
<hr>

<p>It is interesting to note, that almost all the points raised in the
platforms of other candidates and the questions being asked on
debian-vote regard internal Debian issues.  While it is great that
these discussions are being held in such a constructive manner, it is
unfortunate that a DPL election is seen as the venue in which to raise
them.  It is naive to hold to the notion that the candidate who
proposed a solution is necessarily the best person to implement it.
All the discussion and almost all the solutions do not benefit from
DPL authority and could be implemented at any time, by any
developer.</p>

<p>Deserving special mention, two of the candidates this year are
members of the proposed &ldquo;scud team&rdquo;.  At first glance, it
seems a reasonable idea&mdash;teams have helped in other areas of
Debian before.  It does not take much thought, however, to realise
that previous DPLs have never made decisions alone and the team has no
actual benefit over existing practice.  In fact, I worry that
attempting to formalise this arrangement brings new problems, such as
dispute resolution, unclear areas of responsibility, opaque team
member selection processes and further separation between average
developers and &ldquo;management&rdquo;.  In short: with the scud
team, there <em>is</em> a cabal.</p>

<p>The internal role of the DPL is very important but from the
similarities of each candidate's platforms, we can see that
identifying the key issues, such as communication and the sarge
release is not really that hard.  Assuming a calm, understanding and
reasoned approach, the solutions are also reasonably straightforward
and consistent.  Unless you have reason to believe a particular
candidate will have trouble working with other developers towards a
solution, I do not think it is effective trying to compare candidates
based on these issues.</p>

<p>A candidate's suitability for the <em>external</em> duties of the
DPL is much harder to judge.  The point has not been mentioned by
other candidates, but as DPL I believe it is important to travel and
introduce Debian to people outside the project.  Unfortunately, it is
very hard to predict how well a candidate will present themselves (and
Debian) to others without having met them in person.  Since this
relies largely on personality and speaking ability, I am sorry I have
no MIME-encodable evidence to present beyond stating that I believe I
am suitable for these tasks and leaving the comparison between
candidates to you.</p>

<p>In summary, when placing your vote I urge you to choose your DPL
based on the intrinsic qualities of candidates, such as personality,
independence and skill-set, rather than voting based on transient
solutions to today's hot topics.</p>
