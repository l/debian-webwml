    <h1 class="title">Platform for Matthew Garrett</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>My name is Matthew Garrett, and I am standing for the post of
        Debian Project Leader. I have been a Debian developer since
        2002. Inside Debian, I have been involved in maintaining packages,
        working on porting Debian to non-Linux kernels and discussions
        regarding the technical and philosophical issues surrounding the
        project. This has involved negotiations with copyright holders in an
        attempt to obtain software under DFSG-free licenses, analysis of the
        freeness (or otherwise) of licenses and the defence of what I see as
        appropriate standards of freedom for Debian. I represent Debian on the
        Gnome advisory board, liaising with representatives from Sun, Novell,
        Red Hat, IBM and others. In the course of this, I have secured a
        commitment that Gnome will not depend on non-free Java
        functionality. Outside Debian, I have been lead developer on the
        Dasher project (an accessibility application), worked on improving the
        state of Linux suspend/resume support using ACPI and am a contributor
        to the Gnome project.</p>

      <p>During everyday life, I am a PhD student in computational biology in the
        Genetics department at Cambridge University. I intend to use my skills
        for the forces of good.</p>

      <h2>The issues that face Debian</h2>

      <h3>Communication</h3>

      <p>Debian's internal communication is currently poor. It is unclear
        what standards of communication are expected from the teams that are
        responsible for much of the project infrastructure. At the same time,
        information is sometimes requested in a way that does not encourage
        the teams to respond. The combination of these results in everyone
        feeling unhappy about communication.</p>

      <p>You may recognise this issue from such classic debates as why
        packages haven't been built for some architecture yet, why packages
        that were uploaded have not yet made it into the archive, why someone
        hasn't been accepted as a maintainer and many, many more. These
        arguments rarely produce any useful discussion, consume time that
        could be better spent elsewhere and help encourage the perception that
        Debian has an aggressive atmosphere. The lack of communication also
        results in people having a poor idea about what stands between the
        current state of Debian and our release. Our poor communication is the
        single biggest issue to face the project at the moment. It must be
        fixed.</p>

      <h3>Consensus</h3>

      <p>Debian is a free software project. The argument over the general
        resolution that altered the social contract (and more discussions than
        you could possibly imagine on debian-legal) show that people have
        greatly differing standards of what "free" means in this case. I have
        repeatedly defended my beliefs about freedom against the more hardline
        definition that has developed over time, but it is not clear which of
        these definitions more closely matches that of most developers.</p>

      <p>Basic disagreement of this sort results in yet more argument, but
        there is currently no way of determining which side is right. Since
        the social contract was written, the world has changed and the issues
        that we now fight over are ones that hadn't even been considered at
        the time.  A consequence of this is that we are unable to agree on the
        acceptability (or otherwise) of licenses that seek to protect people
        against patent lawsuits. Perhaps worse, lack of agreement over what we
        believe are makes it harder to lobby for our beliefs. If elected, I
        will do my utmost to help Debian reach an agreement over what 
        we believe.</p>

      <h3>Others</h3>

      <p>These are not the only problems that Debian faces and I believe
        that most other problems stem from these. We have failed to release
        because new issues keep arising. With adequate communication, a large
        amount of this delay may have been avoided. Debian's approach to
        licensing is often criticised, but we find it difficult to respond
        because we lack sufficient consensus within the project.</p>

      <p>It may well be that there are other problems that are not a
        consequence of either of the two issues that I have raised -
        communication and consensus. However, I believe that these are fairly
        insignificant in comparison. We should concentrate on fixing the major
        failings before worrying about a multitude of minor ones.</p>

      <h2>What I will do about these</h2>

      <h3>Enhance communication</h3>

      <p>After the election, I will contact each team to discuss the best
        way for them to communicate with the rest of the project. This
        information will be documented and made available
        publicly. Following this, if there are complaints about inadequate
        communication from a team, I will look into the issue and do what I
        can to make sure that the situation doesn't arise again. In cases
        where teams fail to maintain adequate communication with the rest of
        the project, I will do whatever is necessary to ensure that the
        problem is rectified. It is unacceptable for development to be slowed
        down because people are unsure about what is happening. However, it is
        equally unacceptable for team members to be abused by other
        developers.  Developers who are unable to communicate in a reasonable
        way should not expect to obtain useful feedback, and this should be
        recognised by the community.</p>

      <p>In the past, Debian was smaller and interpersonal communication was
        easier. Now we've grown to the extent that it's sometimes hard to
        recognise that everyone involved is an individual volunteer. This
        doesn't alter the importance of communication and it should be the job
        of the project leader to ensure that this vital communication
        exists.</p>

      <h3>Build consensus for the future</h3>

      <p>After the Sarge release, I will initiate a discussion about the 
        social contract. This will be split into two stages:</p>

      <ul><li><p>A discussion regarding what standards Debian should
            hold</p>

          <p>I will introduce new topics for discussion at regular
            intervals. Past threads on debian-project have shown that debate of
            issues such as the acceptability of patent licenses can take place
            with a reassuringly high signal to noise ratio. I am therefore
            confident that reasonable conclusions can be reached.</p></li>

        <li><p>Determine if the existing social contract reflects what we want
            Debian to be and, if not, what should be changed</p>

          <p>I expect this to follow naturally from the first step. In most cases, 
            the meaning of the social contract is clear. If there is a clear 
            indication that the consensus viewpoint is at odds with that meaning, 
            any required changes should be fairly obvious.</p></li></ul>

      <p>Should it become clear that the current social contract does not
        reflect people's beliefs about Debian, then I will work to draft a
        general resolution to alter that. I will seek to ensure that the
        ramifications of any changes are well understood <i>before</i>
        proceeding to a vote, in order to help avoid controversy about the
        result afterwards.  While this process will undoubtedly result in a
        great deal of heated debate, I believe that this will reduce the
        amount of disagreement about what Debian represents in future.</p>

      <h3>The release</h3>

      <p>At the time of writing, it has been 31 months since the last Debian
        release in July 2002. This is not acceptable. The release team has
        been hampered by communication issues between teams, resulting in
        release-blocking issues not becoming apparent until they are too late
        to avoid. I will work with the release team to ensure that potential
        concerns are stated clearly in advance and make sure that these
        problems are being actively worked on. Enhanced communication will not
        directly result in a faster release, but it will make it possible to
        see what progress needs to be made before the release can happen.</p>

      <p>Note that faster releases bring other problems, increasing the
        number of releases that we must support at any one time. I will liaise
        with the security team and stable release manager to ensure that our
        users are not left needing to upgrade excessively or left running a
        distribution that no longer has official security support.</p>

      <h2>Why I wish to do these</h2>

      <p>I do not believe that the DPL should be responsible for the
        day-to-day managing of Debian. Nor do I believe that the DPL should
        determine which direction that the project should move in. I believe
        that these responsibilities fall to the project developers and to the
        teams who have authority over various sections of the
        distribution. The DPL's role should be to ensure that it is possible
        for everyone to perform their roles.  I believe that this is best
        achieved by reducing the opportunity for conflict in the project, by
        enhancing communication, transparency and consensus.  The goals I have
        outlined above are general, but I strongly believe that they are the
        most important issues that the project has to deal with and I believe
        that they are most easily accomplished with the powers that the DPL
        holds.</p>

      <h2>Why me?</h2>

      <p>Both inside and outside Debian, I have demonstrated the ability to
        engage in non-confrontational discussion. I have a good working
        relationship with members of the majority of delegated teams within
        Debian, which has allowed me to work on documentation providing
        information about their Debian roles and responsibilities. I have
        successfully represented Debian to industry figures, ensuring that our
        concerns have been understood.</p>

      <p>In summary, I believe that reaching consensus and communicating are
        the biggest challenges currently facing Debian, and that as Debian
        Project Leader I will be able to help address them.</p>


    <h2> Rebuttal </h2>
    <hr>

    <p>
      Three of the other candidates have discussed how the DPL
      should delegate tasks effectively. Anthony Towns says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      It's my belief that Debian could be improved here simply by
      giving delegates clear authority to make decisions over their
      areas of expertise, and accepting that others are expected to
      persuade or convince delegates and maintainers that something
      should be done in some particular way.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      And the Branden Robinson / Andreas Schuldei "Scud" proposals to
      appoint a team of delegates to perform many of the DPL's roles
      have been widely discussed.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's true that delegates should be provided with the authority
      to make decisions, and to expect that the correct decision can
      be made without receiving undue criticism. However, delegates
      need to be accountable to the entire project, not just the
      DPL. It is entirely reasonable for developers to ask how
      delegates have come to make certain decisions, and it is
      entirely fair for them to expect reasonable answers. In cases
      where this would lead to unacceptable demands on the time of the
      delegates concerned, we should address the fundamental cause of
      the problem by ensuring that more resources are available to the
      delegates. Lack of time should not be an excuse for lack of
      accountability to the project as a whole. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Project Scud is a valiant attempt to resolve the historical
      communication issues between delegates, the DPL and the rest of
      the project by spreading the DPL position more widely. However,
      I have some concerns about the mechanisms involved. The DPL's
      role is to ensure that the right person is doing the right job,
      not to undertake those jobs themselves. Andreas says: 
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      smaller tasks are micro-delegated to the team member that is
      most appropriate for it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Instead, I would argue that tasks should be delegated to the
      <em>project</em> member that is most appropriate. Appointing
      delegates in advance in this way runs the risk of reducing the
      DPL's ability to choose the most appropriate person for the job
      by making it harder to justify appointing further delegates.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than appoint a team in advance, I will appoint delegates
      on an as needed basis as described in the constitution.
      Restricting my choice in advance does not seem like the best way
      of tackling problems that arise.
    </p>

    <p>
      As outlined in my platform, my priorities are improving
      communication and consensus within the project. I do not believe
      that providing more power to a small set of people is the best
      way of approaching these issues. Power should be distributed
      throughout the project, not concentrated within a small subset
      of it. 
    </p>
