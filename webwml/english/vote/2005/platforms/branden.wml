    <h2 id="s1">Introduction</h2>
      <p>I have been a Debian Developer since early 1998.  My most prominent
      work in Debian has been as a maintainer of the XFree86 packages, which I
      have done for seven years as of March 2005.  Since 2001, I have also
      served on the Board of Directors of Software in the Public Interest, Inc.,
      the not-for-profit corporation responsible for holding the Debian
      Project's assets in the United States.  I am in my fifth year of
      employment at Progeny, the Linux company co-founded by Debian founder Ian
      Murdock, where I have both engineering and management responsibilities.  I
      am married with no children.  To my chagrin, I recently turned thirty.</p>

      <p>I have also run for Debian Project Leader every year since 2001, never
      yet successfully.  I continue to run because I continue to perceive
      problems and opportunities within the Debian Project that I would like to
      tackle from Debian's only elected position of leadership.  I was
      disinclined to run this year, and posted a <a
      href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/to_run_or_not_to_run_in_2005.html">statement</a>
      to this effect, but thanks to the encouragement of one hundred Debian
      Developers (including five applicants who will be joining our ranks soon),
      I was persuaded to nominate myself.  The message I received from these
      supporters is that my <a
      href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/campaign/2004/platform.xhtml">goals</a>
      are still relevant, and that I continue to be a convincing exponent for
      those goals.  I warmly thank everyone who asked me, publicly or privately,
      to add myself to the slate of candidates this year.</p>

    <h2 id="s2">My Goals</h2>
      <p>I have written extensively about my goals in my previous platforms for
      Project Leader.  Because my diagnosis of Debian's challenges has not
      significantly changed in the past year, and because it would be nice to
      spare Debian's volunteers the labor of translating more text, I refer you
      to my <a
      href="http://people.debian.org/~branden/dpl/campaign/2004/platform.xhtml">2004
      platform</a> for further details.</p>

    <h2 id="s3">What's Different This Year</h2>
      <p>I'm pleased to report that, a little over a month ago, I was approached
      to become part of a new approach to Debian Project leadership.  Jeroen van
      Wolffelaar, Andreas Schuldei, Enrico Zini, Steve Langasek, and Bdale
      Garbee, and I have formed "Project Scud", a team of concerned Debian
      Developers who have resolved to take some new approaches to resolve
      long-standing problems within the project.</p>

      <p>The strengths of a team-based approach should be obvious: there are
      more shoulders for the work to fall upon, more person-hours of time that
      can be devoted to leadership tasks, and &mdash; most importantly &mdash;
      responsibilities can be shifted to better match individual strengths.
      While there may be no DPL candidate who reflects a voter's ideal vision of
      a project leader, we have seen time and again in the Debian Project how a
      motivated and harmonious team can get things moving and keep them running
      smoothly.</p>

      <p>Equally, with a single elected DPL, there is still someplace for "the
      buck to stop", as a U.S. idiom puts it.  Ultimate responsibility for
      leadership decisions will still fall upon the elected DPL.  One person
      will and must remain finally accountable for leadership decisions, and
      that person is the Debian Project Leader.</p>

      <p>(If you are not familiar with the intimate details of our election
      method, Condorcet with Cloneproof/Schwarz Sequential Dropping, you may
      wonder why Project Scud is running two candidates.  Our view is consistent
      with analysis by Anthony Towns and other mathematicians, and Debian's
      election method will not result in our candidacies "splitting" any
      aggregate "Project Scud" vote.)</p>

      <p>One thing that losing elections can teach a person is how to analyze
      one's own flaws.  I harbor no illusions that I am a perfect DPL candidate,
      and am uncomfortable with the sort of flashy self-promotion that
      competitive elections seem to create.  The Project Scud initiative removes
      even the temptation to do this.  Six people can often achieve what one
      cannot.</p>

    <h2 id="s4">What I Have to Offer</h2>
      <p>Here is what I have to offer as your project leader:</p>

      <ol class="spacey">
        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>An uninterrupted seven years of service to the Debian
        Project.</strong>  In seven years, I've never gone on an extended
        hiatus.  Even when on "vacation" for a few days, I tend to drop in,
        catch up on mail, say hello to my peers on an IRC channel, and triage
        the occasional severity-inflated bug against one of my packages.  I've
        been around for a long time and don't plan on leaving.</li>

        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>A solid grounding in technical, legal, and social
        issues.</strong>  XFree86 is a notoriously difficult package to cope
        with from a technical perspective &mdash; or so I'm told by people who
        had sense enough not to adopt it seven years ago.  I have been a fixture
        on the <code>debian-legal</code> mailing list for years, and have often
        been called upon by my fellow developers, to scrutinize license terms in
        detail and share my assessment on their DFSG-freeness as well as basic
        distributability and liability issues (that said, I myself prefer to
        turn to professional attorneys for actual legal advice).  I have also
        served as leader of the Debian X Strike Force, the package maintenance
        team responsible for XFree86 and related packages for over a year, and
        as noted before I have served on the SPI Board of Directors for over
        three years.  I've met and conversed with dozens, perhaps even hundreds,
        of my peers in the project and have been to many conferences at which
        Debian has had a presence, including LinuxWorld New York, LinuxWorld San
        Francisco, the Atlanta Linux Showcase, and DebConf (at which I made a
        presentation).  I will take full advantage of this knowledge and
        experience as DPL.</li>

        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>Courage.</strong>  I've weathered my share of storms and
        criticism over the years.  I have not shrunk from these critiques
        &mdash; I've done my best to learn from them, and, when persuaded I've
        been in the wrong, have swallowed my pride and admitted error.  (I also
        have extensive archives of my outgoing email messages to back this up
        for the skeptical. <code>:)</code> )  I believe the position of
        leadership demands a balance of confidence and humility, and both these
        traits demand courage.  Arrogance is for the insecure.  As DPL, I pledge
        to represent our Project with integrity, and that includes knowing when
        and where others can best represent us.</li>

        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>Tenacity.</strong>  I'm not a person who gives up easily.
        The Debian Project's problems sometimes have deep roots, but the rewards
        to all of us for solving them will be great.  I believe I have shown
        over the years that I do not easily abandon tasks I consider important.
        As DPL, I am willing to vary my approach or delegate responsibility, but
        I will not let go of a problem unless there is a consensus within the
        project that it need not be dealt with.  I am committed to creating a
        legacy that we can be proud of.</li>

        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>A commitment to openness and visibility.</strong>  An
        important counterweight to tenacity is exposure &mdash; getting one's
        teeth into an issue can be harmful without the occasional sanity check
        from one's peers.  For nearly two years, the nature of my changes (and
        others') to the packages maintained by the X Strike Force have been
        publicly logged in detail to the <code>debian-x</code> mailing list.  On
        several occasions, mistakes or oversights have been noticed by others
        and corrected before they could make it even into Debian unstable.  As a
        Board member of SPI, I've learned from hard experience that visibility
        is not just desirable, but <strong>critical</strong> &mdash;
        particularly in problem areas.  I post regular reports to the
        <code>spi-private</code> mailing list, which all SPI contributing
        members (and therefore all Debian Developers) can read and comment on.
        The position of Project Leader is not a black hole into which the tough
        issues can be discarded, not to be heard from again.  As DPL, I promise
        to produce at least one status report to the
        <code>debian-devel-announce</code> mailing list every month, wherein I
        will detail not just my successes, but areas where I have been unable to
        achieve progress.  Armed with this information, I expect the entire body
        of Debian Developers to offer insights and share in the resolution of
        the challenges that face us all.</li>

        <li style="padding-top: 0.5ex; padding-bottom: 0.5ex"><strong>A vision.</strong>  Despite the challenges I focus on,
        Debian continues to be an exciting place to spend the majority of my
        free time (and even my career).  Our commitment to empowering people
        through software freedom, real choices, and mastery over rather than
        servitude to the computing experience continues to inspire me, and is
        why I have remained a developer.  Organizationally, we are strongly
        egalitarian, and have about as little hierarchy as we can get away with.
        Admission to our ranks can be challenging (and sometimes is not swift),
        but once within the project there are few barriers for talented
        individuals.  The series of DebConf gatherings (for which one of my
        fellow candidates and Project Scud members, Andreas Schuldei, deserves
        no small amount of credit) reinforce our sense of comradeship, which
        ultimately makes us more productive and resistant to disruptive
        influences from outside.  As DPL, I will keep these values, essential to
        our identity, central to my labors to resolve our most pressing
        problems.  In many cases, I think those values can help point the way to
        solutions.  An essential axiom of any role of stewardship is "leave it
        better than you found it".  As a leader, I'm determined to maintain that
        vital essence of our project which has kept me engaged for all these
        years.
      </ol>

    <p>Thank you for your participation in this year's election.  It is an honor
    to serve the Debian Project and its ideals.</p>

  <h2>Rebuttal</h2>
  <hr />

  <div>
    <p>I have always been a bit uncomfortable with the "rebuttal" part of the
    Debian Project Leader campaign process requested by the Project Secretary.
    I don't seek to challenge the credentials or the sincerity of any of my
    fellow candidates.  It takes a fair of amount of boldness just to run for
    DPL, and subject oneself to the high level of scrutiny the process
    entails.  Consequently, I'd like to offer my reflections on the other
    candidates' strengths, rather than attempting to pick apart their
    weaknesses.</p>

    <p>I feel I have much in common with Matthew Garrett, in that we both have
    vigorous personalities.  Neither of us shy away from challenging a status
    quo.  I admire the exuberance that Matthew brings to his work in the Debian
    Project.</p>

    <p>Anthony Towns has a long history with the project and has been intimately
    involved with some of its most important infrastructure.  I think he brings
    a much-needed "insider's view" to this year's deliberations.  Anthony and I
    are also similar in that we both appreciate the sort of engagement that a
    good roaring debate offers.</p>

    <p>I have a lot of respect for Andreas Schuldei, who is my teammate on the
    aspiring project leadership group.  I greatly appreciate his investment in
    ensuring that the social aspect of the Debian Project stays as healthy as
    the technical aspect.</p>

    <p>Angus Lees is not well known to me, but anyone who has the patience to
    maintain Perl modules has a virtue I don't possess.  <code>:)</code></p>

    <p>Jonathan Walther has, I believe, been very important in helping us to
    better understand who we are and who we're not.  I must also confess that
    Given what I maintain, I'm envious of a fellow developer who has zero
    outstanding bugs against his packages.  I cannot even dream of being in such
    a state.</p>

    <p>All of these candidates have something to offer us, but I believe I am
    the most suited to the challenges that will face the next Debian Project
    Leader.  I have been in preparation for this role for longer than my
    competition.  We've seen other approaches taken, but the work ahead requires
    the combination of assertiveness, openness, and accountability that I will
    bring.  With the backing of my teammates and the developers as a whole, I'm
    convinced I can steer us out of the worst of the difficulties that face us.
    With your support, I think we'll all be able to take a look back in March of
    2006 and feel a well-justified sense of pride in ourselves.  I humbly ask
    for your vote.</p>
