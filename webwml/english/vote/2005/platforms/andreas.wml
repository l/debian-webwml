    <h1 id="top">Platform for  Andreas Schuldei</h1>

    <!-- Page published by Emacs Wiki begins here -->
    <h2>Presentation</h2>

    <p>
      I am 34 years old, am married and we have one child. I have been
      a Debian Developer since 2000 and have worked professionally
      with Linux (and later Debian) since 1996. Presently I am paid to
      work on Debian-Edu. I would continue to enjoy the support of my
      employer, if elected, as he believes the role of DPL is crucial
      to Debian - this would also allow me to work on DPL issues
      during work hours.  Many of you might also know me from the
      Debian conferences that I've helped organize.

    </p>


    <p>
      I would like to run for the office of Debian Project Leader
      because:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        I believe that Debian needs some change in how it works (even
        on a social level) and I have some experience in implementing
        change in volunteer contexts.
      </li>
      <li>
        I have experience with leadership in real life volunteer/FOSS
        contexts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where necessary, it will be possible for me to serve as DPL full-time.
      </li>
      <li>I have a track record of being a good organizer.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I also started some time ago to work on some of the problems
      that we have today, namely the <em>FTP-master
        confusion</em><sup><a id="fnr.1" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> and
      the <em>release delay</em><sup><a id="fnr.2"
          href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.

    </p>

    <h2>What I want to achieve</h2>

    <p>
      <em>The overall goal is to make Debian a fun and rewarding context to work
        and spend time in.  So much so, that one misses and longs for it when
        one can't be or work in it.</em>
    </p>

    <p>Part of this goal would be:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        promoting lots of small teams all over the project, in which people
        work together, communicate and help and even integrate and train NMs
      </li>
      <li>having a more friendly and helpful environment on mailing lists and IRC
        channels
      </li>
      <li>making people aware of their leadership role in the project and
        encouraging them to accept it more consciously and confidently
      </li>
      <li>having more frequent and regular releases
      </li>
      <li>
        having more frequent real-life <em>meetings</em><sup><a
            id="fnr.3" href="#fn.3">3</a></sup> like DebConfs,
        bug-squashing parties or development/hack meetings (like the
        debian-installer team does in Oldenburg or the Debian-Edu team
        does in Oslo)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      These steps would make Debian a more enjoyable place and at the
      same time address <em>scalability issues</em><sup><a id="fnr.4"
          href="#fn.4">4</a></sup> that Debian suffers from.
    </p>

    <p>
      Implementing those changes as a one-shot measure is sure to fail
      and will do harm: social change needs to be implemented
      gradually and gently.  Nonetheless it is important to start as
      soon as possible, and even though we won't see instant results,
      it is important to continue steadily and patiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is not necessary to have perfect leaders, prospering small
      teams, and a friendly and helpful working climate, all within
      one month.  But we will soon start seeing noticeable changes for
      the better if we manage to perform many small improvements, one
      step at a time.
    </p>

    <h2>How I want to achieve it: a DPL team</h2>

    <p>
      I believe that the DPL has become a harder job throughout the
      years, with more and more time consuming tasks.  I also believe
      that Debian could do here and there with some serious attention
      which should not be limited by the resources of a single person.
      In order to be better able to achieve my goals, I have solicited
      the help of a small team of Debian Developers.  At present this
      team consists of (in alphabetical order) Andreas Schuldei, Bdale
      Garbee, Branden Robinson, Enrico Zini, Jeroen van Wolffelaar and
      Steve Langasek.
    </p>

    <p>Having a DPL team will allow us to:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        distribute workload, avoiding burn-out and problems related to
        real-world unavailability of individual developers;
      </li>
      <li>
        keep regularly in touch with a larger part of the project, to
        be more proactive about difficulties, and detect them earlier;
      </li>
      <li>
        help build broader consensus by functioning as a 'chair' in Debian;
      </li>
      <li>
        make sure that decisions that need to be made are really made,
        even though that means to keep track of a lot of things, takes
        time and perhaps requires to be in multiple places at the same
        time;
      </li>
      <li>
        have the most appropriate person be responsible for their
        areas of expertise. Everyone has unique talents and
        motivations which make certain tasks more enjoyable for them
        than for others and lets them deal with them more efficiently.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Implementation details:</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>DPL is chairman of the DPL-team.
      </li>
      <li>DPL remains formally responsible for all decisions.
      </li>
      <li>Whenever possible, smaller tasks are micro-delegated to the
        team member that is most appropriate for it.
      </li>
      <li>Important and/or controversial decisions are made in discussion with
        the whole team.
      </li>
      <li>The team meets regularly and frequently (weekly, up to 1h), to discuss new
        issues and review ongoing tasks.
      </li>
      <li>It is a real team, each member can represent it and
        communicate the team's viewpoint above personal viewpoints.
      </li>
      <li>Public minutes of private meetings are made available where discretion
        allows; likewise, a public agenda is made available in advance
        listing all non-sensitive agenda items, in order to allow and invite
        public discussion and public feedback before decisions are made.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      We strive for transparency and are open for more people, but we don't
      intent to grow too much (say, above ~7 people) to keep group-work
      efficient.  Low fluctuation/turn-over and steadiness is desired,
      however, there is no expectation for team members to stay on longer than
      they're able to.  
    </p>

    <h2>Leadership</h2>

    <p>
      Good Leadership exists in the free software world, Debian included, and
      happens mostly without anyone noticing, not even the person who took the lead.
      Good examples in Debian are Steve Langasek in the release team,
      Petter Reinholdtsen in Debian-Edu or Joey Hess in Debian-Installer. 

    </p>

    <p>
      Leadership in voluntary organisations like Debian lacks the
      instruments of power that are used in business environments and give
      leadership its bad taste. That does not keep some people from trying
      to apply them anyway: usually this results in people leaving or
      frustration in general. The answer to fear of bad leadership is not to
      have no leadership at all, but to seek good leaders. Great leaders
      do not just appear out of nowhere, but they need to grow. Small teams are good
      environments for them to develop their skills and learn from others.

    </p>

    <p>
      The "Herding of Cats" failed. The problem is in the word "herding"
      which implies "keeping people in the place where they are". People
      are more inclined to pursue some fascinating goal. Debian's goal is to
      produce an excellent free operating system and have fun doing so.
      The leader's task is to keep that vision alive and vivid and to
      encourage people to want to go there.

    </p>

    <h3>Make Life better!</h3>
    What leaders in voluntary projects can do and must do is to:

  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>empower the right people to do work that fits their talents,
        motivations and temperament;
      </li>
      <li>find and help other leaders on the way towards their fields of interest;
      </li>
      <li>inspire people about where Debian, their subproject or small teams
        could and should go;
      </li>
      <li>make their area of influence as fun, pleasant and rewarding as possible for
        people to work or dwell in;
      </li>
      <li>make themselves redundant.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      It will take time to gently introduce this in Debian.

    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Small Teams</h2>
    Small teams are probably the single most important characteristic that a group
    like Debian needs to have to be able to grow in a healthy way. If done
    right they can solve many problems.

  </p>

    <h3>What small teams could do </h3>

    <ul>
      <li>They provide a <em>smooth entry point</em> for new people to learn the ropes and
        skills (NM).
      </li>
      <li>They are the <em>place where one can get to know people</em> quickest and best (due
        to the small number of people in the group).
      </li>
      <li>Due to the stronger social bonds in smaller groups the likelihood of
        people going <em>MIA is much reduced</em>.
      </li>
      <li>People can form a <em>knowledge pool</em> when cooperating on package
        maintenance, infrastructural or organisational tasks, and that pool is
        less likely to get lost then a single person.  This would make Debian
        more resilient against wild busses, unmaintained packages or head hunters.
      </li>
      <li>Because these teams can grow and divide on their own, they are
        <em>self-organizing</em> and provide for <em>very good scalability</em> in numerical
        growth.
      </li>
      <li>They serve as a sandbox for people to discover their inherent
        motivations, talents and temperament relevant to Debian work.
      </li>
      <li>They make <em>communication</em> easier.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>What small teams need to be like</h3>
    For a team to be able to fully serve those functions it needs to have a
    couple of necessary features:

  </p>

    <ul>
      <li>It must <em>not grow too big</em> (7 seem to be a sweet spot) or it becomes
        less personal.
      </li>
      <li>Team members are aware that the group will divide itself after it
        grows past a certain limit and the opportunity arises.
      </li>
      <li>The members of the team must be <em>socially compatible</em> (the basic
        chemistry must fit).
      </li>
      <li>People must be able to have contact frequently (IRC would be good).
      </li>
      <li>The team should not only concern itself with technical matters, but
        the whole human being. it should be possible to discuss TV-series,
        politics or football, find friends or fall in love.
      </li>
      <li>The team should be open for new people.
      </li>
      <li>It should have a leader as described in <em>Leadership</em>.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Introducing such a small team organization into Debian takes time and is a
      gradual process.  While group maintanance of packages is no novelty and normal teamwork
      does happen, this concept is more.

    </p>

    <p>
      If you elect me to be your
      DPL, I will be in a much more effective position to advocate and
      implement such teams within the Debian project.

    </p>

    <hr />

    <h2>Working Climate </h2>
    The attractiveness of a group depends significantly on the feeling of
    how <em>welcomed, respected, and appreciated</em> their members feel. Even
    though the word is incredibly hackneyed and frequently abused, I still
    want to describe the relationships we need as "loving" since it
    communicates the concept best. The quality of
    communication in groups is strongly correlated to this key
    characteristic.

  </p>

    <h3>Indicators </h3>
    The tone of conduct in Debian is a good indication of how "loving" the
    people are towards each other. Is the atmosphere friendly and constructive, or
    caustic and corrosive?  Humor, laughter and fun are the positive
    components which make a group a pleasant environment to be in. Random
    acts of kindness are possible in virtual communities as well and can
    even extend into Real Life.

  </p>

    <h3>Where it works better</h3>
    Sub-projects which are smaller, more personal and where people meet
    regularly achieve a much better signal/noise ratio in communication and
    feel warmer then the big busy mailing lists and IRC channels Debian
    has.

  </p>

    <h3>Change is possible</h3>
    It is possible to purposefully change relationships and the tone of
    conduct in Debian. We can inform people about basic group dynamics
    and help them to find better forms to express themselves. Everyone
    should learn when when a mail or remark is not worth sending, for
    example. 

  </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
      What I propose in this platform is at the same time "radical" and "just common
      sense": most of it is about making Debian less stressful and more fun.
      The only changes that will ever be accepted are those that people want, in
      Debian as in other places where people are free.

    </p>

    <p>
      I believe that these changes are so obviously good ideas that we <em>want</em> them,
      regardless of who will be elected as a DPL.  Electing me is a way of showing
      that you agree, and to get started.

    </p>

    <h2>Rebuttal</h2>

      <sup>[<a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a>]</sup> <strong><em>The FTP-Master confusion</em></strong> 

    </p>

    <p>
      For some time there has been some irritation, general flaming or even
      open hostility between FTP-masters and some other Debian developers
      regarding the job of FTP-masters and the way they think it is supposed
      to work. This is an example of negative working climate in Debian.

    </p>

    <p>
      The situation has reached a dead-lock where one side demands
      transparency and accountability and the other refuses to comply as
      long as the climate remains hostile.

    </p>

    <p>
      The multi-stage solution to the problem takes some time and will
      provide a long term scalable solution. I discussed it with some
      FTP-masters and individuals who could do the work. As an additional
      bonus it fits well with the "Small Teams" approach I will push elsewhere
      and resembles the release master/assistant and the AM/Frontdesk/DAM
      model that works satisfactorily already.

    </p>

    <p>
      This is just one example of what I would do if I was elected DPL.
      While I can de-escalate and mediate already today, having the
      authority that comes from being the chosen leader of all developers is
      a help for leading this project to successful resolution of internal
      conflicts.

    </p>

    <p>
      <sup>[<a id="fn.2" href="#fnr.2">2</a>]</sup> <strong><em>Release Delays</em></strong>

    </p>

    <p>
      Debian needs more frequent, regular releases. The present delays cause
      frustration and a decline in morale in Debian country. To pave the way
      for a smoother development cycle and release process i took the
      initiative, acquired sponsorship (from NUUGF) and organized a meeting of
      the release team and FTP-masters taking place soon.

    </p>

    <p>
      <sup>[<a id="fn.3" href="#fnr.3">3</a>]</sup> <strong><em>Real-Life Meetings</em></strong>

    </p>

    <p>
      Besides being fun, meetings serve a few vital functions, especially
      for virtual communities as Debian:

    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>They help people get to know the person behind
        the on-line persona, and have a better understanding of one another
      </li>
      <li>They help to see the greater Debian community.
      </li>
      <li>Real Life provides unparalled bandwidth for communication,
        minimizing misconceptions.
      </li>
      <li>People get newly inspired for Debian by meeting people and
        listening to good talks.
      </li>
      <li>Group settings can be very productive for problem solving.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      So while meetings themselves are not a goal per se, their results
      definitely are and have proven to be of high value to Debian.

    </p>

    <p>
      <sup>[<a id="fn.4" href="#fnr.4">4</a>]</sup> <strong><em>Managing Growing Needs</em></strong> 

    </p>

    <p>
      Capacity planning is frequently a challenge for large organizations,
      and once you fall behind, it's even more difficult to catch up.  A lot
      of Debian's hottest issues over the past few years have been capacity
      issues: making sure the autobuilder network scales to handle our
      package count; making sure the NM process scales to meet the number of
      incoming applicants; making sure the security team scales to handle
      the architecture count; etc.  While many of these issues are largely
      technical in nature, the task of identifying and resolving chokepoints
      before they become a problem is one that requires managerial
      attention, and the DPL is best suited to provide this oversight.
    </p>
