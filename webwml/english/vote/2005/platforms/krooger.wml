    <h1 class="title">Platform for Jonathan Walther</h1>

  <h2>RELEASE EARLY, RELEASE OFTEN</h2>

  <p>Many users have been leaving Debian, or choosing other distributions
  without even trying Debian first. With a steady, consistent release cycle
  like that of OpenBSD, we can surge in popularity far beyond what we already
  have. Momentum builds moment, and with carefully managed momentum building
  we can dazzle the world with a distribution that will be eagerly sought
  after by desktop users as well as server gurus.</p>

  <p>I joined Debian in 1998 because it was the greatest GNU/Linux
  distribution on the planet. It still is. It just needs a bit of polish.
  Over the years I've seen our hard work pay off as others incorporate it in
  fantastic products like Knoppix, Fink, and Ubuntu. As DPL, my first focus
  will be on our release schedule. I have a proven history of releasing
  software on time, on schedule. Project Xouvert, a stripped down version of
  the X11 source code, was released two times, six months apart. We didn't
  achieve many of our more ambitious goals, but we got a working release out
  the door on time, both times.</p>

  <p>With Debian's archive pool, we always have something to release. We will
  not need to compromise our high standards in any way. If new software isn't
  ready to go in the stable release, it just won't go in. With a regular
  release cycle, this isn't a worry; there is always the next release in six
  months. Ubuntu and Xouvert both borrowed the 6-month concept from OpenBSD.
  It is proven, it works, and it will turn Debian into a monster powerhouse
  of software goodness.</p>

  <h2>ADDRESSING THE GENDER IMBALANCE</h2>

  <p>Lately more and more concern has been raised about the lopsided ratio of
  male to female developers in Debian. As soon as I am elected I will appoint
  the following stakeholders to examine our New Maintainer process in depth
  and produce a report on Debian's barriers to entry for women, and
  recommendations on fixing them.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Sandra Chua</li>

    <li>Helen Faulkner</li>

    <li>Carla Schroder,</li>

    <li>Erinn Clark</li>

    <li>Margarita Manterola</li>

    <li>Jutta Wrage</li>

    <li>Matthew Palmer</li>

    <li>Michael Banck,</li>

    <li>Matt Zimmerman</li>

    <li>Luk Claes</li>

    <li>Enrico Zini</li>

    <li>Christian Perrier</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They have three months to prepare their report, when it will be posted
  on the Debian website for use in future General Resolutions.</p>

  <p>I will personally invite gender-bias experts Gloria Steinem and Germaine
  Greer to chair the committee and participate as much as they wish. Their
  findings and replies will be included on the Debian website.</p>

  <h2>WHO IS DJW?</h2>

  <p>I started programming on a Commodore64 in 1987, then graduated to
  Pascal, C, and C++ in high school. When the internet arrived at my
  highschool in 1993, I stumbled on Linux and Free Software almost
  immediately, and knew they were the future. Programming jobs were scarce
  for junior Free Software programmers in the wastelands of northern Canada,
  so I hitchhiked around North America visiting other Debian developers,
  searching for work, and developing my coding skills using the <a href=
  "http://www.kohala.com/start/">Richard Stevens</a> books. Finally I moved
  to the <a href="http://vancouver.ca/aboutvan.htm">Big City</a> in 1998 and
  participated in lots of interesting projects since.</p>

  <p>I brew organic beer and enjoy having friends and fellow developers over
  to drink it. Beer isn't beer without spirited debates on a wide variety of
  topics. When they lived in my city, I hosted the ratpoison get-togethers.
  Ratpoison is a windowmanager so lean and uncluttered you think you are
  using the Linux console. Did I mention I hate bloat?</p>

  <h2>LEADERSHIP APTITUDE AND ABILITY</h2>

  <p>My Meyers-Brigg personality type is <a href=
  "http://reactor-core.org/~djw/entj.html">ENTJ</a>, the natural born leader.
  Complementing this, I am a gifted public speaker, pleasant, polite, and a
  keen listener. These are all qualities that can make or break a DPL, and
  which impact the project directly. A sense of humor is also important, and
  I have one larger than an elephant. Not even an elephant gun can defeat
  it!</p>

  <p>My public speaking experience includes presenting to the local Linux
  User Group, as well as work and church related public speaking before large
  audiences. As a Canadian, perhaps it is a natural talent, but I excel at
  fostering consensus, even in hostile environments.</p>

  <p>I get results. The <a href=
  "http://reactor-core.org/ogg-tagging.html">Ogg Tagging</a> standard has
  been in widespread use the past few years, because it was needed and wanted
  by a community of users. If I hadn't stepped up to the plate, it wouldn't
  have happened. When OpenBSD said it wouldn't provide SMP support for the
  PowerPC platform because of lack of hardware, I started a massive
  pledge-drive. You can see the successful result <a href=
  "http://www.dalerahn.com/~drahn/G5rcpt.jpg">here</a>. I focus my efforts
  where they can do the most good. This year, they can do the most good as
  your DPL.</p>

  <p>Compassion, tolerance, and humility are essential to making any project
  run smoothly. Should I lack any of these qualities, I'm sure it will be
  quickly pointed out. Whatever my other flaws, you can be guaranteed that I
  will always listen to what you have to say. As DPL I may have to make
  decisions you will disagree with, but your opinion will always be weighed.</p>

  <p>What makes Debian great is that we are a team. We have many experienced
  members with decades of engineering experience, and a dedicated commitment
  to working together that has overcome barriers of language, culture, and
  politics. As DPL I am the ideal candidate to represent the diversity of
  vision and interests that make up our project.</p>

  <p>See you at the polls!</p>
