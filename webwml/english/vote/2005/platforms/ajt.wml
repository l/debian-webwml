    <h1 class="title">Platform for Anthony Towns</h1>
    <p>
      Hi. My name is Anthony Towns. I'm running for DPL this year. These
      are the things I'd like to work on.
    </p>
    <h2>Welcoming people to the project</h2>
    <p>
      I think it's important that the project accept contributions from
      an as large and diverse group of technically skilled people as we
      can manage. I think the best way to achieve this is:
    </p>
    <ol style=" list-style-type: lower-roman">
      <li>
        To have our lists filled with interesting technical
        discussions, that welcome intelligent contributions from
        new-comers, and don't waste a lot of time going over old
        ground or off-topic subjects.

</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        To have newcomers be invited to act as assistants to existing
        groups; and for helpers be treated like individuals, rather
        than a new build that needs a standardised test suite run over
        it.

</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        To have users be able to participate in the project in an
        acknowledged way, and thus able to be consulted on decisions
        directly, rather than to have their opinions guessed at by
        developers.

</i>
      </li>
      <li>
        To make our activities far more public, by doing things such
        as conducting more discussion on existing lists, creating
        temporary lists for quick discussions that are nevertheless
        permanently archived within Debian, and summarising
        discussions over IRC or in person to lists as a matter of
        routine.
      </li>
      <li>
        To actively try to include derivatives into the project,
        rather than passively hoping they'll contribute to us
        -- such as including projects like Knoppix, backports.org,
        Ubuntu, fink and others into the archive where possible; and
        otherwise helping relationships with folks like HP, Linspire,
        SkoleLinux and others.

    <h2>Project Effectiveness</h2>
    <p>
      Although sometimes it's hard to tell, Debian actually has a
      purpose: namely to create a great free operating system. It's
      important for us to be effective in achieving that purpose --
      it's no good have the best design for an operating system, or
      the best policies for putting it together, or the best
      procedures for maintaining it if we don't ever get around to
      following the design, policies and procedures and implementing
      something. I think Debian's been falling behind in this
      department, and I think the way to resolve that is to work at
      actually making decisions and standing by them, rather than
      trying to maintain a fractured consensus by repeatedly having
      the same debates with new participants.</p>
    <p>Our mechanisms for making decisions are:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
      <li>consensus on the mailing lists</li>
      <li>judgement of delegates and maintainers</li>
      <li>judgement of the technical ctte</li>
      <li>general resolution by the developers as a whole</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The first of these has been the key to Debian's success -- any
      decision that can more or less satisfy everyone in a diverse
      group is a pretty good one. It's not always possible to make a
      decision that way, of course; which is why we need the other
      options. Unfortunately they're not working well at present.</p>
    <p>
      It's my belief that Debian could be improved here simply by
      giving delegates clear authority to make decisions over their
      areas of expertise, and accepting that others are expected to
      persuade or convince delegates and maintainers that something
      should be done in some particular way.
<i>Further remarks:
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00037.html">[1]</a>
</i></p>
    <p>
      Additionally, I think that the technical committee would serve
      the project better if it were composed of active members of key
      teams, rather than the current membership of wise elders; both
      as an indication of confidence in our delegates, and to ensure
      the technical committee's knowledge of Debian's processes is as
      current and complete as possible.

    </p>
    <h2>Distribution Quality</h2>
    <p>
      Finally, I think we could produce a substantially better
      distribution. Much of that work has already been done by derivatives
      -- such as the init script speedups Ubuntu folks have worked on,
      or the LiveCD development Knoppix is famous for -- and we can
      gain those features just be working on better integration with
      derivatives; but there are other issues that, to my mind, Debian
      itself should be working on:</p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
      <li>
        Better policy -- at present "policy" is fragmented between
        debian-policy, the Developers Reference, various subsystem
        specific documents, and word of mouth. I believe we should
        work on integrating that into a single package, if not a
        single document.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better QA -- having the full source code to all the software
        we use gives us the chance to excel in a bunch of "QA" type
        areas; I think we shouldn't just aim at grabbing all the cool
        software out there and putting it in a .deb, but that we
        should be filing off the rough edges too, by writing automated
        test suites for our packages, making sure everything is
        documented, and working towards zero defects in everything we
        ship.
      </li>
      <li>
        Better package selection -- a problem that every Debian user
        has faced and will probably face again is working out which
        packages they want installed; do you want ether-wake, or
        wakeonlan, eg? I think it's long past time we made some
        consistent progress in this area, addressing issues like
        package categorisation, package overlap, and accessibility of
        non-free or commercial packages.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Addenda</h2>
    <p>
      So, a couple of other notes, which you might or mightn't find
      relevant.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think the role of the DPL is, well, to lead the project: to
      find particular areas that the project should focus on, and to
      find areas where the project's being dysfunctional and help it
      sort itself out. The DPL really only has one power, and that's
      to give authority to others. That's a fairly subtle power --
      it's the difference between someone having the root password and
      having permission to use it. But in a group of people who care
      about what's right and wrong as firmly as Debian developers do,
      it's actually a fairly important power.

</p>
    <p>
      For those who care, I joined Debian in early 1998. I'm the author
      of ifupdown and debootstrap. I've written patches for gzip (#30537,
      \#184057), dpkg (#93386, #112386, #184635), pax (#139943), and others.
      I've participated in the LSB and FHS forums, and on a variety of
      Debian lists. I still eagerly await the day when #18733 and #62529
      are resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wrote the CGI scripts for bugs.debian.org as a proof of concept
      and started preserving old bug reports rather than letting them be
      lost forever once they'd been closed for a month. I then found
      myself on the debbugs team when the old scripts that generated the
      static pages once or twice a day started failing because we just
      plain had too many bugs. I also added support for bug tags, queries
      by submitter, cloning bugs, and blocking access to the control@
      address for people who abuse it.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most public activity in the project has been my participation
      in release management. I started being involved in that in '98 by
      getting involved in the discussions on -devel about the "Debian
      release modem" (sic) and along with other interested folks came up
      with the ideas behind testing. After more discussion and modifications,
      I started implementing "britney" in 1999 by maintaining a hardlinked
      copy of the archive, and eventually got to the point where I thought
      it was ready to start integrating properly in 2000. At that point
      I offered to help Richard Braakman out with potato's release
      management, who at that point sensibly fled the country, and I got
      to do the final phases of potato's release, which came out in August
      2000. I then worked with Jason Gunthorpe (who's the primary author
      of Apt for those playing along at home), and James Troup to get the
      archive converted to pools so that the horrible hardlinking stuff
      could be dropped and testing could be mirrored, and we rolled testing
      out in late 2000. Sometime around this point I was added to the
      ftpmaster group to make the integration easier. I continued as
      release manager for woody, at which point I thought it'd be a good
      idea to follow Richard's fine example, and was lucky enough to have
      Steve Langasek and Colin Watson volunteer.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took the opportunity to step down from the release management
      role last year for a few reasons. The long term reasons were
      that I'd been looking to pass on the RM role for quite some time
      -- I'm more interested in (and effective at) initial design and
      implementation than long term maintenance -- and that Colin and
      Steve were already at the point where they were doing most of
      the work anyway. The proximate cause was that I no longer felt
      confident that I had the project's support to do the RM job, and
      that Colin and Steve would have a much better opportunity to do
      that without continuing confusion and distractions. I think
      that's actually panned out fairly well.
    </p>
    <p>
      My ftpmaster activity mostly consists of maintenance of britney,
      design work, with occasional poking at processing new packages and
      removal requests. I did a fair amount of work coordinating the move
      of crypto software into main, figuring out how to redo security
      support for the woody release, and designed and implemented the
      signed Release files and helped with the apt support thereof.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      I think my experiences within Debian match reasonably well with
      what I'd like to achieve and that some good progress on the
      above items should be possible over the next year. But hey, I've
      been wrong before.
    </p>
    <h2>Critiques of Alternate Candidates</h2>
    <p>
      And hey, these people have been wrong before too!
    </p>
<h2> Rebuttal </h2>
<hr>
<h3>Angus Lees</h3>
<p>
I envy Angus's brevity up to this point, and hope one day to be
able to match it.
</p>
<h3>Matthew Garrett</h3>
<p>
I think Matthew's platform is pretty good. His priorities are
slightly different from mine, but I think if he achieves what he
plans, it will be good for Debian.
</p>
<p>
I do, however, disagree with Matthew's focus on non-confrontational
discussion. It's my belief that attempting to avoid confrontation
tends to result in trying to satisfy the most argumentative people,
since they will tend to ensure there is a confrontation unless they
get exactly what they want, whereas quieter people will generally
not cause a confrontation until things start becoming seriously
unsatisfactory. I do believe it's possible for people to deal with
differing opinions and different approaches respectfully, without
having an argument, or being rude; but I think it's important for
anyone in a leadership position to be ready to stand up for the
people working with them, and that means at least the occasional
confrontation. I believe it's far better to have those confrontations
and resolve them, than it is to avoid them.
</p>
<h3>Andreas Schuldei / the Scud Project</h3>
<p>
I find the development of the Scud Project quite disconcerting; it
seems to have been a secret group of Debian developers who have gotten
together with the specific goal of taking control of the project,
and really I'm not sure how something like that could be anything but
disconcerting.
</p>
<p>
Andreas and Steve did all (or at least almost all) of the organising
of the release cabal meeting held in Vancouver (on the 5th and 6th
of March), which was a great idea and, I think, highly effective
-- but it was also organised without the knowledge of the current
DPL, let alone with much information being provided to the rest of
the project. I like to joke about the cabal in Debian, but that's
because in my experience it *is* a joke; all the people in positions
of power in Debian have fairly different opinions and do quite
happily work against each other, fail to communicate with each other
at least as much as with the rest of the project, and have all
manner of other problems. The Scud Project by contrast seems to
have been an actual "cabal" up to this point, and I'm confused as to
how deliberately appointing such a group to lead Debian could be a
good thing in promoting the sort of open, public, community-oriented
development that Debian's famed for.
</p>
<p>
Another concern with the Scud Project is that it's not at all clear
how it will operate if elected -- whether each member already has
well defined areas of authority, or whether the DPL will make the
decisions and the team will enact them, or whether they'll try to
make decisions as a group with the DPL as a figurehead. It's not
clear if that depends on which candidate is elected. It's also not
clear how fully the Scud Project supports the platforms of its two
candidates, or how fully the candidates support each of the team's
members. That seems like it makes it a bit of a crap shoot voting
for either candidate from the Scud Project.
</p>
<h3>Branden Robinson</h3>
<p>
There's probably not much I can write about Branden that won't be
dismissed with something like "Oh, but AJ and Branden fight all the
time, of course he'd say that". And if you're into amusing epic
archetypes, Branden and I even joined the project in the same week
(late February 1998 for those who want to check the -private archive
-- also the same week Eric S. Raymond joined).
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I've two concerns with Branden that you may or may not wish
to consider. The first is his consistent focus over his years of
campaigning on procedural issues to the exclusion of technical ones:
I think it's far more important for members of the project to focus
on what we want to achieve rather than how we want to achieve it,
and that we're much better off if we screw up the processes
occasionally but don't lose sight of what we're trying to achieve,
than the converse. I think that should be reflected in the project
leader's priorities.
</p>
<p>
My second concern is that I don't think Branden's demonstrated that
he's very effective at achieving his goals. When he became SPI
treasurer in August 2001, his aim was to fix the record keeping
problems that had accrued up until that point, and become far more
transparent and efficient at accepting and processing donations and
distributions. Unfortunately, and for various reasons, he didn't
manage to achieve this -- to the point where donations to the Debian
project over a period of something like a year were not deposited
at all, and then expired such that they're unable to be deposited
at any point. With Branden's demotion to deputy-treasurer under
Jimmy Kaplowitz, he seems to have become dramatically more effective,
which speaks well for him, but, to my mind, still indicates he's
unready for a significant leadership position.
<i>Further remarks:
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00698.html">[1]</a>
</i>
</p>
<p>
I feel I should also note that while Branden indicates that Project
Scud supports the election method we use at least for the DPL vote,
he was one of the few people who voted against its adoption at the
time it was proposed; and further argued extensively that it
encouraged insincere voting in the lead up to the non-free votes a
little over a year ago.
</p>
<h3>Jonathan Walther</h3>
<p><i>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00014.html">
Related comments from Erinn Clark regarding Jonathan's proposed stakeholder committee</a>
</i></p>
<p>
I find I disagree with the sentiment Jonathan notes in his platform
of increasing concern related to the involvement of women in Debian.
I, personally, have been quite heartened by both the increasing
number of women who feel they can participate in Debian, and the
form of their participation, in particular Margarita Manterola's
magnificent dpkg state diagrams, Hanna Wallach's presentations at
Linux conferences, and the mentoring programme being run by Helen
Faulkner, as well as the usual range of package maintenance and bug
reporting and fixing. TTBOMK, this activity is thanks mostly to the
work by Erinn Clark and Helen Faulkner in setting up and maintaining
the debian-women project. It's particularly impressive that all
these women have made all their contributions to date prior to
having successfully passed through the new-maintainer queue.
</p>
<p>
I think the best thing we can do about women's participation in
Debian is admire their accomplishments to date, do what we can to
help them improve upon their achievements, and ensure we incorporate
their successes into other areas of the project.
</p>
