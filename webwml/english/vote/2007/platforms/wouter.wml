<h1>Who am I?</h1>

<p>I am 28 years old (I will turn 29 in may), and live in Belgium; I grew
up in the town of Ekeren, which since the early 1980's is part of the
city of Antwerp. I hold a degree of <q>Graduaat</q> Business Information
Technology which I earned in 2001 at the Karel de Grote-hogeschool of
Antwerp; a Graduaat is similar to a Bachelor's degree (which, indeed, is
what it's been replaced with by now). Today I'm self-employed, and
single.</p>

<p>My first contact with Debian happened in the summer of 2000, when I
was setting out to use Linux From Scratch, then still a HOWTO, to build
my own system; and rather than using RedHat&mdash;which I had been using
for three years prior to 2000&mdash;as a base system to compile software
on, I downloaded an ISO image of Potato Test Cycle III which I then
installed.  I guess it's a compliment to the technical quality and
impressiveness of Debian that my LFS project never got finished; and
that by February of the next year, I had reformatted the partition that
I had set aside for it and become a Debian Developer. Yes, it was
possible to make it through NM so fast in those days.</p>

<p>A few months later, I received an old mac from a friend. Interested
in trying out Debian on another architecture than just i386, I set out
to install Debian on this machine. A few weeks later, I had become part
of the Debian/m68k porting team, of which I am still a member to this
day. As it turned out, the original mac that I had received couldn't
even be used to run Debian/m68k, because it had a broken 68LC040
processor.</p>

<p>Those interested in knowing more can have a look at a <a
href="http://grep.be/articles/debian">list of things I've done for
Debian</a> that I've been (somewhat) maintaining on my website since a
few years.</p>

<p>Ironically, I joined the Debian project as a means to <q>temporarily</q>
satisfy my desire to join some Open Source effort, until I could find
and join some <q>real</q> project that involved <q>real</q> coding. It didn't take
me a long time to realize that Debian, in some ways, is much more <q>real</q>
about these matters than some other projects I have come into contact
with over the years.</p>

<p>One word about my name: I was born and raised in an area where Dutch
is the language of choice, and so many people who do not speak the
language have problems pronouncing my given name at first. It's not very
hard, however: my name rhymes with one particular pronunciation of the
word <q>router</q>. It does not, however, rhyme with <q>scooter</q>. If you want
to be absolutely perfect and pronounce it like a native Dutch speaker
would, then you'd need to use a hard <q>t</q> in the middle of the word
(i.e., not softening it to a <q>d</q>), and use a rolling <q>r</q> at the end. But
those are details. My family name is pronounced pretty similar to how
someone familiar with the english language would assume it is.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<p>I believe Debian is about two things: people, and (Free) technology.
While it is possible to put emphasis more on one of those two, it is
important to realize that neither of them can exist without the other.
We need people to create the technology of which we're all very proud;
and we need technology to keep us geeks busy, happy, and proud to be
part of Debian. Take away the technology and Debian degrades to a lousy
debate club which I'll give, at most, a year before it perishes; take
away the people and everything else will vanish, because technology
doesn't create itself. Well&mdash;at least not until we invent AI
powerful enough to do so.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I feel that Debian, as it exists today, has
overemphasised the technical side of the project too much, and has in
some cases done this at the expense of the people who make up the
project. I don't want to provide an example here and start pointing
fingers, but suffice to say I feel this is not an unnatural phenomenon:
being good in technical matters is a prerequisite for joining the
project, while being good in interpersonal matters is not; it's
therefore only expected that technical matters get more attention.</p>

<p>In addition, the fact that we communicate mainly over the Internet does
not help things. ASCII is very good at conveying words in the English
language; it is not very good at conveying emotions. It is often said
that in face-to-face communication, 90% of what you say is conveyed by
body language. If this is true, then email, IRC and weblogs are a very
poor means of communication; and it is a fact that these are the main
media with which we communicate with eachother.</p>

<p>On top of that, they are slow. A heated discussion in Debian can
easily take a few weeks or even more than a month; and as I've been able
to experience first-hand in the past, such a long discussion can easily
drown out and demotivate a person quite a bit if they have a stake in
the argument, to the point where they'll consider to give it all up.</p>

<p>Socially, there is a culture on Debian's mailinglists which, as
many have pointed out, is not always optimal. In some settings, flaming
is commonplace; and at the very least, mouthing off against eachother
will go unpunished.</p>

<p>I believe this makes Debian less of a fun place to be than is
necessary, and that it's long overdue to do something about that. Josip
Rodin recently suggested to form a <q>Social Committee</q>, to make
decisions in social matters, much like the Technical Committee has
authority over technical matters today; and while I think that such a
dispute resolution system is a good idea in itself, I also feel that
avoiding disputes altogether, where possible, would be even better.</p>

<p>On a more practical and immediately useful level, there are a number
of things I feel are wrong with the organization of the Debian Project
as it exists today:</p>

<p>First, the position of DPL is perceived by some to be a position of
technical leadership or, at least, to have the ability to appoint and
dismiss those in a position of technical leadership.</p>

<p>I believe this is wrong. In a Free Software project such as Debian,
the ability to lead on a technical level very much depends on past and
current accomplishments of the technical leader him- or herself. As Eric
Raymond <a
href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s16.html">puts
it</a>: <q>authority follows responsibilty</q>; in other words, you need
to have worked on something before you can become its leader.  Obviously
a DPL is a Debian Developer and therefore has worked on Debian; but the
DPL does not necessarily have the experience and history that is found
in most Benevolent Dictators that lead other projects.</p>

<p>Of course, when I say the DPL has a lack of some practical leadership
abilities, that does not mean I think the DPL is totally powerless,
and/or that we would be better off without a DPL at all; if that were
the case, I would be very silly indeed by running for DPL.  However, I
do think the DPL could benefit from better outlining what his or her
responsabilities and abilities really are.</p>

<p>Second, the Debian Constitution contains a whole section on Delegates
to the Project Leader which, by the way it is worded, gives me the
impression that it was meant to be used for people in role positions:
ftpmasters, system administrators, and similar. However, many of these
people in role positions are <em>not</em> delegates; when I once asked,
I was told that this is on purpose. I'll let the non-delegates in role
positions do their own explanation, but the gist of the explanation as I
remember it was that they want to be sure the integrity of their work
and, indirectly, the whole Debian project, is not compromised by a DPL
who does not fully understand their motives for doing things in a
particular way.</p>

<p>While I can understand this as a motivation for not wanting to be a
delegate, I think it does pose a problem. I have no doubt that people in
role positions are very much aware of the importance of the work they
do, and that they aim to do it to the best of their abilities with
Debian's best interests in mind; however, it should be a known fact to
anyone who's been involved in the project for a while that some of these
teams have been the cause of frustration with other developers on
numerous occasions in the past, which is not beneficial to the project.
Moreover, if the delegate position is not used by those for whom it
would seem to have been made in the first place, we might just as well
not have it at all.</p>

<p>Some have suggested that non-delegates in role positions should be
replaced for that reason. Personally, I do not believe that this would
solve many things, while it <em>would</em> create a number of additional
and unnecessary problems.</p>

<h1>What do I propose to change the situation?</h1>

<p>Well, I don't know that yet.</p>

<p>Of course I do have <em>some</em> general ideas as to what I could do
to improve Debian; the careful reader may be able to distill some of
them from the <q>Background</q> section above. However, I feel that more
than anything, it is important that before even attempting to implement
these ideas I should discuss them with the people directly involved. It
may very well be the case that after this discussion my ideas turn out
to be not very good at all; that something entirely different would be
needed to improve the situation. Therefore, I felt it better to outline
what I think the current problems in Debian are, rather than explaining
what I'll do about them.</p>

<p>My lack of detail should not be mistaken for a lack of determinism,
however.</p>

<p>That being said, there is one thing which I do not think needs much
discussion, and which I therefore can easily make promises about
already:</p>

<p>I will do my best to more promote the organization of meetings, of
all types and sizes.  Anthony Towns, our current DPL, has recently
proposed to allow disbursment of Debian funds for holding meetings. I
already had, and continue to have, similar plans, and think this is a
great idea. As explained above in the <q>background</q> section, I believe
that communicating via the Internet is problematic, at best. There is no
better way to have two people reach a certain level of understanding
than to put them together in a bar and to let them have a good
face-to-face chat over a beverage of their choosing, or to put them in
the same room and allow them to work together on things that they care
about. This is what you will see in many large corporations with teams
working together in branch offices spanning the globe: occasionally,
they will meet up in some location somewhere (often an exotic one), to
work together at some important project in a face-to-face setting; but
such meetings also tend to involve other less work-related things,
euphemistically called <q>team-building</q>.</p>

<p>There is no reason why Debian couldn't do the same. And in fact, this
is already happening to some degree: we have DebConf, where many people
meet up, hold talks, and share ideas; we have meetings sponsored by
parties like the Junta de Extramadura, and others. We have developers
meet up at local events, such as FOSDEM, linux.conf.au, LWE, and others.
We've also had occasional small meetings that were fully organized by
Debian people, sometime with and sometimes without external help, such
as the QA meeting in Darmstadt and the Vancouver meeting a few years
back.</p>

<p>As DPL, I will consider it my duty and do my utter best to make sure
as many as possible of such meetings can be held. I will do this by
encouraging people to go to events when they can; by encouraging
developers who have personal disagreements or seem to hold grudges or
vendettas to talk to eachother when they have a chance to see eachother
in person; by encouraging companies and governments that use Debian or
otherwise have a stake in the future of Debian to help hold such
meetings; but also, more directly, by allowing the disbursement of
Debian funds to allow Developers to hold a meeting of some kind that is
directly related to Debian.</p>

<p>Obviously, such disbursements will have to be regulated to some
degree, because we don't want to be without money at the end of this
term. The guidelines which Anthony set forward would seem to be more or
less okay, even if they're quite new and might perhaps need some filing
off of rough edges in a few months or so; but we'll see whether this is
true at that time. Also, it should be clear that third parties, such as
companies, governments, or others who want to sponsor people to go to
such meetings can (but absolutely do not have to) follow the same
priorities which the Debian project will follow.</p>

<h1>Who should <em>not</em> vote for me</h1>

<p>There are a number of reasons why people sometimes vote for DPLs; and
in an effort to avoid having to answer such questions during
campaigning, I thought it might be nice if I answer them beforehand.</p>
<p>You should not vote for me if you want a DPL who will...</p>
<ul><li>...seek controversy. I'm not saying I
won't take <em>any</em> controversial decisions&mdash;I'm not so naive
to think that's even possible; avoiding controversy at all cost will
most likely also result in not taking <em>any</em> decision, at
all&mdash;but I will not force through any changes if I feel that the
gain would not outweigh the controversy they cause.</li>
<li>...crack down on and/or replace some of the people in role positions
in Debian. I intend to work <em>with</em>, rather than <em>against</em>
such people, to improve what I can improve.</li>
<li>...propose, and try to implement, many radical changes. While I am
<em>definately</em> not suggesting a complete standstill of the project,
I <em>am</em> of the opinion that major changes in a project the size of
Debian are best introduced sparingly and slowly.</li></ul>

<h1>Finally,</h1>
<p>I'd like to thank you for staying with me for this long. I hope you
agree with me that the problems I've outlined are in much need of
change. If you do, I urge you to vote for me on the upcoming DPL
elections, and I will thank you for your confidence</p>
<p>In closing, allow me dig up a quote by Colin Walters in &lt;<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/06/msg00475.html">1055185240.13855.18.camel@columbia</a>&gt;,
which has been a source of motivation and inspiration to me on many occiasions
in the past:</p>
<blockquote><p>
I don't deny the benefits.  I do think that in the current
implementation, the drawbacks outweigh those benefits.  That's not to
say it couldn't be done.  But if it is done, we should do it *right*.
We're Debian.  That's what we do.
</p></blockquote>

<h1>Rebuttals</h1>
<p>All this is IMHO, and of course YMMV. I'm usually not the type of guy who
will publically tell people what I think of their ideas in this type of
confrontational way; rather, I prefer to try and understand their point of
view, so that I can provide suggestions that follow from my point of view in
order to find out what the best possible way to go forward is. I find this
usually works, depending on the personality and willingness to compromise of
the other party. However, since this is how the election process works, here we
go.</p>
<h2>Aigars Mahinovs</h2>
<p>Aigars' platform basically outlines five things. I feel I can only agree
with the first. On the others:</p>
<ol><li><q>Make Debian a trunk</q>: I think getting all Debian packages
in a version control system, as Aigars is suggesting, will be very hard
to do, if is at all possible; at the very least, I predict many
flamewars about what will be our version control system of choice. Next,
it would require a complete change of our procedures&mdash;I wouldn't
want to be responsible for ftpmastery while such a change is being
implemented.</li>
<li><q>Organise home folders and configuration files</q>: Debian isn't
the right place to do that. It would require every maintainer to start
adding sometimes horrible patches to their packages, which will
introduce Debian-specific bugs, render a lot of beginner-style
documentation useless, and will cause other people to think of us as
crazy fanatics.  For once, they'd be right. Mind you, organizing home
directories is a great idea, and a battle that I wish Aigars the best of
luck with; but it has to be fought upstream, not here.</li>
<li><q>Recheck our skills from time to time</q>: that would be a waste
of time. Long-time developers are usually either valuable contributors
(in which case a check of skills is unnecessary), or are inactive (in
which case we need to figure that out, either through MIA or through
WaT). I think it's totally impossible for incompetent people to stay
active in Debian for the better part of a decade and remain
unnoticed.</li>
<li><q>Drop the trademarks</q>: I would truly <em>love</em> a world in
which there would be no people who want to abuse our name in a way that
would be detrimental for the project. Unfortunately, we do not live in
such a world. In the real world, people will abuse our name. They will
not spare us because we are a volunteer project, as the case around the
Linux trademark in the US has shown. The only way to avoid this from
happening to Debian is to have a trademark.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not having a release this year does sound like a worthy goal to me.
However, I'd like to point out that setting the target release date is
something which I'd consider the responsibility of the Release
Managers.</p>
<p>In short, while I have met Aigars in Helsinki at Debconf5 and think
he has a pretty clear understanding of many free foftware-related
things, I do not think his platform outlines what is needed to keep
Debian going forward.</p>
<h2>Gustavo Franco</h2>
<p>Gustavo has a lot of separate plans. I hope he realizes that
implementing them all would be a <em>lot</em> of work; I do not think he
can do them all in one term. YMMV, of course. Rather than making this
text long enough to be unreadable by replying to each and every one of
them, I will limit myself to the ones that I think are the most
interesting ones:</p>
<p>I like Gustavo's idea about release goals. It sounds like a
reasonable thing to do.<br />
Promoting more group work, be that through <q>groups</q>, <q>subprojects</q> or
<q>supergroups</q>, also sounds like a worthy goal to me.<br />
I think his idea to promote local Debian meetings and to improve the
<q>Debsphere</q>, as he calls it, is definately a worthy goal; I have a
similar promise in my platform.<br /> 
Getting more Debian ports official, and getting Debian to be officially
supported on desktop systems sounds like a goal that would push Debian
further. While I'm not sure it's critical, it would certainly be a good
thing if it could be accomplished.<br />
Adding information about whether people are interested in non-maintainer
upload to a source package could in some cases help during bug squashing
parties and similar things. It sounds like a good idea, though I'd like
to point out that all what's needed to implement this idea today is to
propose an amendment to Debian's Policy document.</p>
<p>His ideas about the BTS, the New Maintainer system, and the NEW
queue seem to have been prepared without discussing them with the
people involved; in fact, he even admits this in one case. I do not
think it is very wise to do that.</p>
<p>The Technical Committee is a body that, by the text of the
constitution, can only act <q>as last resort</q>, when <q>efforts to resolve it
via consensus have been tried and failed</q>, or when it was <q>asked to make
a decision by the person or body who would normally be responsible for
it</q> (§6.3.6 of the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">constitution</a>). In other words,
if it is mostly inactive, that means it is working as designed. Getting
it <q>more active</q> therefore sounds like a strange goal.</p>
<p>I do not like his idea about adding new packages to stable. I once
said this in &lt;<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-release/2004/06/msg00050.html">20040614115818.GD23810@grep.be</a>&gt; (which got me <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Infodrom/fortunes/lookup.php?keyword=that+should+not+be+touched%2C+ever&amp;category=all">in</a>
the infodrom fortune file):<br />
<cite style="text-align: center;">In my opinion, the conservative rules
for updates to stable are a feature, one that should not be touched,
ever.</cite><br />
and I stand by that today.</p>
<p>What I do miss in Gustavo's platform is focus. It seems as if he
wants to do everything at once. I don't think that's possible.</p>
<h2>Sven Luther</h2>
<p>I have some sympathy for the things Sven has gone through in the
project, although I cannot deprive myself of the idea that there are a
number of things he could have done to at least ameliorate, if not
avoid, many of the things that have happened. However, running for DPL
in an effort to get broader attention for his problems in the community
does not sound like a good approach to me.</p>
<h2>Sam Hocevar</h2>
<p>I have found in Sam's platform what I miss in Gustavo's. If he is
able to accomplish what he outlines in his platform (and I have no doubt
that this is the case), then he is a very strong candidate indeed.</p>
<p>I do not share all his ideas, however. For instance, I do not think
that shortening our release cycles is the ideal thing to do. I think the
steady pace at which Debian is going has its advantages (even if I'll
agree that it has its problems, too). There is no reason why we should
try to be everything for everyone, and being a steady rock that people
can build on&mdash;a new distribution, or a desktop system, or a
business&mdash;should not be something we should be ashamed about.</p>
<h2>Steve McIntyre</h2>
<p>I don't have much to say about Steve's platform. This is not because
I think it makes no sense; on the contrary. I do have some different
priorities, but I generally agree with what he has to say.</p>
<h2>Raphaël Hertzog</h2>
<p>This is a difficult one.</p>
<p>Raphaël wants to promote a <q>DPL Board</q>. I have similar issues with a
theoretical DPL board as I had with what has become known as <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2005/03/msg00302.html">Project
Scud</a> (although I did not properly explain it in that mail): it
sounds like introducing anonther level of red tape, of which I think
there is already too much in Debian and which, if not done properly, may
create more problems than it attempts to solve.</p>
<p>Having said that, the attentive reader will notice that I am on
Raphaël's shortlist of people whom he would like to have a seat in the
board. A short explanation of why this is true can be found in Raphaël's
platform. The slightly longer version sounds approximately like this: I
may be of the opinion that another level of red tape will not help the
project, but ultimately this has to be the project's decision; and if
the project, through a DPL GR, indeed chooses that this will help, then
who am I to say it's silly?</p>
<p>Therefore, if Raphaël does indeed win the election and my own result
is good enough to assume that I have a level of support which I deem
necessary to serve on such a board, I will probably do so; but I won't
set up a similar board if I get elected.</p>
<h2>Anthony Towns</h2>
<p>The most obvious difference between Anthony's platform and mine is
what he declares as the most important point. Where I clearly state that
technology matters, but that I want to focus on the people who make out
the project this year, Anthony clearly focuses more on the technology.
Both of us acknowledge the other position, but we have different
priorities.</p>
<p>While there's certainly nothing wrong with that if you think people
matter less than technology, this just is not how I think about the
project.</p>
<p>Moreover, Anthony also is our current DPL, and he's made some fairly
controversial decisions over the last year, including the decision to go
with dunc-tank over the objection of a number of developers. Some of
these were very valuable contributors, and some of them have left the
project as a result. While I did not and still do not have any problem
with paying developers to do Debian work in principle, I think this kind
of <q>I know it all best</q> is precisely what §5.1.9 of the constitution is
trying to prevent.</p>
<p>It could be argued that my second point is a direct result of the
first.</p> 
<h2>Simon Richter</h2>
<p>Simon was rather late in submitting a somewhat short platform. This
gives me the impression that he either made a very last-minute decision
to run without thinking very much about the ramifications, or that he
lacks some motivation. The fact that he was the last person to become a
DPL candidate, very late into the nomination period, would seem to
support the former. In any case, neither of these two possibilities are
qualities which I would like to see in a DPL.</p>
<p>The platform itself also fails to convince me, mainly due to what I
perceive as lack of content: he mentions two examples of past problems,
but does not mention whether he thinks these are still relevant, or
whether something similar will occur in the future; and by not giving
many arguments, he does not convince me that the problems he mentions
have anything to do with what he apparently considers to be the root
cause of all other problems in Debian&mdash;personally, I think it's
much more complex than just the forming of subgroups, although this may
certainly be related.</p>
