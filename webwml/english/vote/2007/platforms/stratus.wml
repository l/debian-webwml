<h1>
Platform for Gustavo Franco
</h1>


<h2>
Introduction
</h2>

<p>
I was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil - some time ago. I work for a NGO called
Information Network for The Third Sector - that is focused on strengthening
civil society organizations and social movements, where I am coordinating the
technology team, supervising the internet services from our own ISP and leading
the development of a custom Debian distribution.
</p>

<p>
I've been using free software for ten years and Debian for seven years, during
this time I give a lot of FOSS related talks across the country. Besides
GNU/Linux, I have also used FreeBSD and OpenBSD operating systems. I like them
and look forward to a Lenny release with kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64, at
least.
</p>


<h2>
Why vote for Gustavo Franco?
</h2>

<p>
I've started contributing to the Debian project almost six years ago and waited
for my account creation after recommended to the DAM for more than three years,
it happened two years ago. During these two years I have done much more than
before, and the keyword is: motivation.
</p>

<p>
I ask your vote to keep motivated people working to meet our goals, during my
term. I'll cover these goals in detail below and if you share a lot of them, I
think I am your candidate, otherwise if you share just a few of them I think
you should rank me just below your preferred candidate. There's the possibility
that I haven't outlined any common goal we've here, don't hate me instantly.
Drop me a message privately and tell me about your goals into the Debian
project. I'll do my best to point out at least one we've in common and work on
it during my term, if elected.
</p>

<p>
I would like to inform that considering that we can't force volunteer work,
people on key positions that are overloaded or unable to do volunteer work for
some reason, will need to share their roles with others for the better of our
universal operating system. Voting in me means that you respect people's legacy
and skills but don't accept not well documented and immutable positions in our
organizational structure.
</p>


<h2>
History in Debian
</h2>

<p>
After joining pkg-perl team and contributing into the group as a whole,
including policy updates. I figured that we had not a similar project for
python modules so I founded the Debian Python Modules Team with Guilherme
Pastore right after we were joined by Raphaël Hertzog and many others
contributors. I've also started the pkg-ltsp group after talking in real life
with Otavio Salvador about the ltsp packaging status and how we lagged behind
Ubuntu. Then I organized a online meeting with Ubuntu ltsp maintainers and
Debian ltsp maintainers to discuss cooperation, as a result we've now almost
the same set of features in unstable and Debian Etch can easily be used as a
thin-client server.
</p>

<p>
I've also managed to glue: Debian Desktop development website, debian-desktop
mailing list and debian-desktop project in alioth - including pkg-gnome,
pkg-kde and pkg-xfce members to work around a real Debian Desktop with common
artwork and set of features, during Etch development cycle. Also with
cooperation from tasksel, debian-cd and debian-live project members, I think
we've in Etch the best Debian desktop experience ever.
</p>

<p>
I'm also a member and contributed to the following groups: Debian web pages,
GNOME Team, tasksel, debtags, Debian-BR, Ubuntu Backmerging Team and
pkg-galago.
</p>


<h2>
My platform
</h2>

<p>
I plan to dedicate more time on the key topics below. I want to send monthly or
as-it-happens updates to debian-devel-announce with the related bug numbers (if
any) or report summary. I'll keep you informed about what I consider as key and
others issues that I am sure will appear:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
    The Core Teams
    </p>

    <p>
    I consider the Debian server administration (including ftp archives),
    keyring management, documentation, ports, security, release management and
    installer the key areas into the project. These areas and the corresponding
    core teams except for documentation, release management and installer are
    easily the most criticized groups for more than six years. During this time
    we've released slink, woody, sarge and are challenged by some children
    distributions that in the next six years or less will be more relevant than
    Debian in every area and will be able to claim that they are really
    developing the universal operating system.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will request from the core teams clear procedures on how a Debian
    developer can contribute to them and join them after some time, by merit. I
    want to make clear how a assistant role differs from a full member of a
    core team and how a assistant can apply to be a full member. In less than
    one year, there will be no single point of failure in any key area, if you
    really don't want it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Let make clear that I won't candidate myself as member of any core team
    during my term.
    </p>

    <p>
    I will also work to keep Debian's Organizational Structure page updated and
    document every position listed there.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Release goals
    </p>

    <p>
    The Debian project has no fixed release schedule and the basic argument
    from those who support this approach is that it enhances quality.
    Regardless of how much time you spend during a development cycle, if you
    don't do the work there will be no enough quality to promote. The other
    point is if you keep working without clear goals besides the better quality
    possible, you will never release.
    </p>

    <p>
    I heard that a company based on Redmond is known to spend a lot of years
    between their operating system release and this approach alone have not
    increased the product quality nor they have the greatest and latest tools
    bundled with the OS.
    </p>

    <p>
    Previous DPL candidates proposed Debian to increase its tempo and a fixed
    release schedule.  Unfortunately, I have seen no real actions from them
    besides the hard work from the release team during Etch development cycle.
    </p>

    <p>
    I want to move forward and clearly define Lenny release goals during my
    term. I think that there is a lot of key software and projects (involving
    groups or groups of groups) in Debian that can be used as <q>backing
    track</q> for our releases (eg.: kernel, installer, the most used web
    server, the most common desktop environments). With <q>backing track</q>, I
    meant that once we have the upstream versions defined previously by us in
    place, that's time to freeze and establish the operating system as a whole.
    Like we've a procedure for qualify an architecture for release, I want to
    discuss with the release team and you a procedure for qualify a software or
    project as a release goal.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    The Bug^W Debian Tracking System
    </p>

    <p>
    Actually, we're not using our Tracking System's full potential. The code
    behind bugs.debian.org, with just a few add-ons, some tweaks and usertags
    proper usage can act as what I call the Debian Tracking System. You're free
    to keep calling this <q>BTS</q> though, but if elected I will push for the
    following changes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Add vote support. If well implemented, a contributor or developer can
	easily spot bugs that affect many users. Every release critical bug
	receive attention before release, the same can't be said about non
	release critical bugs, but a lot of them annoy many users.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add <q>report a bug</q> in the web. Let the users write bug reports
	against packages or pseudo-packages into the
	bugs.debian.org/packagename page, requiring an submitter email and
	maybe implementing CAPTCHA. Send the submitter a <q>confirm your bug
	report</q> message before sending the bug report to the package
	maintainer and listing it into the web interface.
      </li>
      <li>
	Add debian-admin pseudo-package. I would like to see debian admin team
	preferably using the system to track public pending issues. Please also
	read #408150 at http://bugs.debian.org/408150
      </li>
      <li>
	Add a statistics page. It would contain at least the recent top 5 bug
	closers, bugs closed and bugs opened.
      </li>
      <li>
	Extend the usertags concept to implement userbugs, as in bugs that only
	the submitter or a group of subscribed people (including the maintainer
	or not) can manage through the email, but won't be displayed in the
	bugs web page of a package or pseudo-package. This feature is useful
	for projects like utnubu and could also be used for transitions.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    I also want to make sure that any localization initiative involving a web
    interface to coordinate translations will not turn the current wishlist
    bugs approach we've into BTS a maintenance nightmare. I think we can
    deprecate the current behaviour periodically importing the pending
    translations into the new system, but it would be better if the new system
    could coexist and respect the BTS bug numbers. This way importing a
    translation for a package release, would still close a bug.
    </p>

    <p>
    Unfortunately I haven't discussed yet these proposals (except for #408150)
    with the BTS admins due to time constraints, but if elected I will prepare
    with help of others a more detailed proposal for each feature and initial
    patches for them.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    New Developers
    </p>

    <p>
    That's clear we need new and skilled developers, Debian Developers are a
    rare resource, Debian regular contributors aren't so common and we have
    many users to satisfy. It isn't easy as it sounds, keep the <q>fresh
    blood</q> coming. I would like to see Joerg Jaspert with full DAM
    privileges (including keyring maintenance capabilities), promoting a well
    known AM by its results as DAM assistant to work together with Joerg and
    James.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    New Packages
    </p>

    <p>
    I think that one or two new people can handle packages in NEW queue that
    are not really new, but just old source packages generating new binaries
    without licensing changes. This change will be done if needed, after
    ftpmaster team review. Who and why assistants are assistants and what they
    can't do that full members are supposed to do.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    The Technical Committee
    </p>

    <p>
    The Technical Committee is established by the Debian constitution, section
    6. It is the body which makes the final decision on technical disputes in
    the Debian project. If the web page is up-to-date their last technical
    decision was in 2004, the committee was extended after that though. I would
    be glad to see a more active technical committee during my term.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also plan to propose a General Resolution to change our constitution
    (6.6) to bring at least two elected members into the technical committee
    during my term and be sure that the changed constitution will allow us
    rotate the technical committee members from time to time. I believe that we
    will see interesting platforms coming from skilled people into the project
    interested in review and work on to solve our problems exposed by the Bug^W
    Debian Tracking System (pseudopackage: tech-ctte). I think it can be the
    next logical step to active and vibrant members of the community with a
    interesting history into the project, and feel they can act like a bridge
    between any Debian contributor and the core of the project on technical
    issues.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    The Debian hidden treasure: Groups, subprojects and supergroups
    </p>

    <p>
    There's a lot of Debian users and enthusiasts that don't realize how much
    we've evolved in terms of groups, subprojects and supergroups. I understand
    groups as any group in alioth; subprojects as more official groups with a
    page into our official website and supergroups as a group of groups (eg.:
    debian-desktop).
    </p>

    <p>
    I think that without our GForge setup (in alioth) we wouldn't have so much
    organized groups, supergroups and even some subprojects that already
    existed but weren't much active. During my term I will discuss with the
    technical committee if it's worth write detailed technical procedures to a
    alioth group apply and be promoted to a subproject. It would be special
    useful for service oriented groups (eg.: backports and sponsors), because
    some users simple don't know or refuse to use them because their
    non-official status.
    </p>

    <p>
    Groups, subprojects or supergroups, I think as a community we should use
    and promote more what's cool and working. I see proposals involving stuff
    that mentors and sponsors does for ages. Spread the word about your
    favorites alioth projects now!
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    New software in a stable release and backports
    </p>

    <p>
    Based on the criteria to promote groups to subprojects, I would like to see
    backports promoted during Lenny development cycle. This way we will be able
    to add new but officialy supported software in a stable release. The
    security support and criteria for inclusion needs further discussion, that
    I plan to do with the involved teams and technical committee.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Debian is a universal operating system
    </p>

    <p>
    Where's the Debsphere then? The Debian project needs more official events
    and a calendar to track them. I think that the debconf (our major yearly
    event) current and past organizers can share their experience with local
    event organizers on how to obtain and handle funds from sponsors and put
    local conferences out of the paper. I'll discuss with the parties involved
    the possibility of create a formal events team too.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll do my best to see at least debconf asia, debconf north america and
    debconf latin america happening after our global debconf in Scotland this
    year and before the global debconf in Argentina. These local Debian
    conferences should be smaller and focused on reunite developers and
    contributors that couldn't attend the global event due to its distance and
    schedule, give local related talks, develop the local related agenda, work
    on to organize bug squashing parties. With the possibility of invite and
    welcome some foreigners of course.
    </p>

    <p>
    I want to promote the <q>week of Debian</q>, a week in August where Debian
    user groups, some Linux user groups and the Debian community as a whole
    will be encouraged to promote user related events. Developers can
    participate help organizing such events or giving talks. The groups
    interested in developers talks from distant areas will be able to contact
    us and we can act as a router between the organizers, sponsors and the
    developer to fund the travel and cover others costs. The <q>week of
    Debian</q> organizers will prepare a list with developers willing to give
    talks in a volunteer manner, close to their home or in distant areas.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm all for development <q>hands on</q> groups meeting, a events team could
    do the hard work of organize such specialized kind of conference and the
    development group can dedicate most of its time to do what they do better.
    The events team also can act as a gateway between the press team and the
    group busy working on our next big feature, to make sure that the
    development summit results are well known by anyone interested.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Debian ports
    </p>

    <p>
    I will do my best to motivate more people to help us release Lenny
    supporting kfreebsd-i386 and kfreebsd-amd64, and try to push a major vendor
    to officially support Debian GNU/KFreeBSD servers, if elected.
    </p>

    <p>
    I also want to discuss source-only uploads and the possibility of force a
    source-only upload compile on a fast enough architecture before trying in a
    slower one. I would like to see and help Lucas Nussbaum working on piuparts
    over testing during Lenny development cycle to spot bugs that passed
    unnoticed and if successful enable basic upgrade/install/remove tests on
    almost any package, after compiling on a fast enough architecture.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'm all for virtualized build tests, specially on architectures we will not
    release in Etch. The people interested on this project, if elected, can
    contact me. I will make a proposal for the technical committee related with
    buildds results guidelines. Hopefully with Lenny+1 this discussion will be
    a thing of the past and we will have full and stable virtualized
    autobuilders.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Debian friendly hardware and vendors
    </p>

    <p>
    During my term I want to make at least one major desktop hardware vendor
    sell and support machines with Debian Etch desktop pre-installed. I also
    want to make one major Linux powered gadget vendor use Debian Etch. Based
    on HP results during 2006, in theory it will be easier see a major vendor
    add support to a product line or two in the server camp. Anyway, it will
    encourage their competitors, also medium and smaller players to also sell
    Debian support. There are two interesting and intentional side effects: Our
    users will have more options to run Debian, and we will enlarge the
    universe of possible Debian contributors employers.
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll work on with the related teams to write specific documentation for
    vendors interested in pre-load unmodified Debian on their systems. It is
    easier than they think using debian-installer preseeding, we just need to
    tell them.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am aware of the computer vendors that pre-install Debian list at:
    http://www.debian.org/distrib/pre-installed. I'm not sure the list is
    really accurate, but I will work with the press and www teams for a wider
    usage and to make sure we keep the entries updated.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Debian website
    </p>

    <p>
    We've a fantastic website in terms of content and localization but without
    search engines I don't enjoy browsing it and I am sure others will share
    the same view. I want to review with the web team the most common Debian
    website use cases and where we fail to cover them, a small design update,
    possibility of integration with some wiki content and work on Debian web
    guidelines for content not hosted by us. I want to make it easier to people
    working on websites around the Debian ecosystem use a similar design and
    promote it as a best practice.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am open to temporarily 'fork' the website to test new ideas, with access
    restricted to developers-only and collect feedback at debian-www mailing
    list. These new ideas can be be tests to cover some use cases and the small
    design update, as cited above. I like the bar in one of the proposals to
    the debian-community.org layout
    (http://www.debian-community.org/dc_proposal2.png), and I think that
    details like these could be tested over our current website content.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Debian Publicity
    </p>

    <p>
    I will discuss with the press team and debian-publicity mailing list,
    strategies on how to promote more what is actually so good about Debian
    project and Debian GNU/Linux operating system.  There are tons of
    possibilities, like promote more alioth and sponsors.debian.net usage for
    newcomers. Issue more press releases with relevant content or with
    companies, publishing that they had good results using Debian or selling
    support. I would like to read more Debian articles on general technology
    related websites and magazines than just only on FOSS dedicated websites
    and I will do my best for this during my term.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>
    Non-Maintainer Uploads
    </p>

    <p>
    I'll promote the LowThresholdNMU, that is today in the wiki and is opt-in
    for each maintainer, for each package. We can do this using a new optional
    file into debian directory, called <q>nmupolicy</q> containing something
    like the following:
    </p>

    <pre>
Format: 1
NMUFriendly: Yes|No
NMUNotes: &lt;comment&gt;
    </pre>

    <ul>
      <li>
	Packages without both fields should be NMUed following the current
	rules or if otherwise stated by the release management team.
      </li>
      <li>
	Packages with the NMUFriendly set to yes and no NMUNotes field should
	be still treated as maintained by the person or group listed in the
	Maintainer field but uploadable by any other developer, following a
	simple rule: Patch attached to a bug in the BTS before upload.
      </li>
      <li>
	Packages with the NMUFriendly set to yes and with NMUNotes should state
	in this field clear notes on how the NMUer should proceed different
	than <q>patch attached to a bug in the BTS before upload</q>. The
	following sentences are valid examples: <q>Contact
	debian-desktop@lists.debian.org and wait at least 4 days.</q>; <q>Just
	NMU for normal bugs or greater</q>; <q>Just NMU for RC bugs</q>;<br>
	<q>No NMU for wishlist bugs</q>.
      </li>
      <li>
	Packages with the NMUFriendly set to no and no NMUNotes field should be
	treated as if both fields weren't being used.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Debian Policy and new maintainers guide (at least) should be updated to
    document <q>nmupolicy</q> file usage. dh_make code could be updated to
    create a debian/nmupolicy template. PTS, bugscanner, lintian and linda
    codes could be also updated to use these fields.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
I will also tattoo a swirl in the end of my term. &mdash; stratus
</p>


<h2>
Rebuttals
</h2>


<h3>
Wouter Verhelst
</h3>

<p>
I'm sure he has some general ideas about how to solve some Debian problems and
improve the situation, my problem with his platform is that he failed to make
clear what he's going to do. I want a more communicative and transparent
atmosphere and Wouter started failing as a lead right from his platform. He is
a great contributor, though.
</p>


<h3>
Aigars Mahinovs
</h3>

<p>
Debian aims to be a Universal Operating System. A Universal operating system
with no releases makes no sense from my point of view, but if Aigars wants
something Debian that will never be released <q>as is</q> and actually is a
trunk. He is free to use and advocate unstable (sid). There's no need to be DPL
and change nothing.
</p>


<h3>
Sven Luther
</h3>

<p>
Rebuttal Coming Soon.
</p>


<h3>
Sam Hocevar
</h3>

<p>
Sam has a interesting platform, with some good points. It seems that we sit and
write our platforms together, but we didn't. I don't know him, really. I just
don't think that make fun of his own ideas will bring us to a better
atmosphere. I hope he push to do a lot of stuff he proposed on his platform if
not elected. It seems that his decision to not change any delegations will put
him on a frozen state if elected.
</p>


<h3>
Steve McIntyre
</h3>

<p>
Steve seems to be a great person, and I had the pleasure to work with him while
fixing Simple-CDD to work with the new debian-cd. Unfortunately, I fail to see
where he as the 2IC during the last term, pushed to do what was on his and/or
Anthony's 06' platform. I can't trust that he has enough motivation and
commitment to his current platform then.
</p>


<h3>
Raphaël Hertzog
</h3>

<p>
Raphaël usually has good ideas from what i've seen. The DPL board isn't a bad
idea and I wasn't expecting him to declare that a 8 person board would perform
8 times better than a DPL alone. My problem with his platform is that there are
just a few ideas coming from him, and nothing from the other 8. Are they going
to do something really? Why not bring more visibility to the technical
committee and ask members advice, as I've proposed? There are 3 candidates
listed as possible board members. Why these other three aren't writing about
the DPL board on their platforms? Is this a trap? I hope not.
</p>


<h3>
Anthony Towns
</h3>

<p>
I think if he focused more on his platform from the last year he would be a
better DPL. I feel sorry for so many critics he's receiving due to his legacy
and skills into the project, really. Unfortunately, it seems that he failed
again using his current platform to publish a sort of past year schedule than
apologies for mistakes, consider what he did and wasn't evaluated yet and
justify why he haven't moved on with the changes proposed on his 06' platform.
</p>


<h3>
Simon Richter
</h3>

<p>
Same deal as Wouter, with the fact that Simon wrote even less.
</p>
