<h1>Steve McIntyre's DPL platform, 2007</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
I've been a Debian Developer since October 1996. I originally joined
to maintain the Debian version of mikmod; I was the upstream developer
at the time, and wanted the Debian version to work well too. In those
days, the NM process was rather simpler than today: I installed
Debian, then two days later I mailed Bruce Perens with a PGP key and
asked him for a Debian login. He responded almost immediately with
account details - I was in!
</p>

<p>
Since that point, I've worked on quite a wide range of packages, some
large and some small. Probably the most noticeable work I've done for
Debian is within the debian-cd team, both developing the debian-cd
software itself and using that same software to create the official
CDs (and now DVDs) that accompany each Debian release. I've been
involved with the CDs for almost every major and point release since
Hamm.
</p>

<p>I stood as a candidate in the DPL election last year, and came
second to AJ. Shortly after the election, he contacted me and invited
me to take up a new delegated position of Debian "2IC", or Assistant
Project Leader. I accepted, and since then I have been helping him
with some of the duties of the DPL - dealing with correspondence,
representing Debian to the press and at various Free Software
gatherings and acting as a mediator in some disputes. This has given
me a good insight into the work of the DPL: what it entails and just
how much time it can take.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Much of this platform will be familiar to people, as it is largely
based on what I said at this time last year. Most of the things I want
to work on in Debian have not changed in that period: they are well
known problems, issues that have affected us for a long time.</p>

<h3>Communications within the project</h3>

<p>This is a long-term bugbear; DPL candidates have been promising to
work on improving communication within the project for as long as I
can remember. There are several places where communication has been
problematic in the past. Sometimes DPL effort has helped to fix
things, but more often there has been no visible improvement.</p>

<p>Simple, regular status updates from the various teams within the
project can help a great deal here. Equally, regular reports from the
DPL are needed to make sure that the Debian community are aware of
what is being said and done on their behalf. Even if some of these
reports consist purely of "Sorry, I've been busy in real life and not
accomplished much", simple confirmation that posts are not sitting
unattended is better than nothing. I aim to encourage these updates,
and if elected I will commit to distributing regular news from the
DPL.</p>

<h3>Training and NM</h3>

<p>Currently the NM process contains detailed tests of an applicant's
technical abilities, and of course this is a good and useful thing to
do. Unfortunately, we don't select for social skills; we need to work
together as a community!</p>

<p>NMs are often asked to show their skills by constructing a new
package and/or taking over an orphaned package. This can be good for
testing packaging skills, but can lead to NMs working on packages in
which they have no real interest - further down the line these are
most likely to be the packages that are abandoned.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest that more NM training can/should happen more
within teams. We have a large number of packages where the maintainers
could do with help, and a large number of NMs looking for jobs to
do. I believe this is a great place where we can improve. We need some
sympathetic maintainers to make this work - they will be responsible
for the work done, and then will be expected to report to the relevant
AMs. I have already volunteered some of my own packages towards this
effort, and I'd like to encourage other DDs to do the same.</p>

<p>We also still need to work out how to more effectively deal with
the multiple different types of contributors that we have these
days. As well as package maintainers, we have more and more people
working in other important areas such as translation. It's well past
time that we had an good debate on this topic and settled the
issues.</p>

<h3>Openness within the project</h3>

<p>We promise to be as open as possible, but we often fail on this
front. Sometimes this is necessary (e.g. when discussing embargoed
security updates), but much of the time it is not. Sometimes
discussions are private when they do not need to be, and this is not
good for us. Sometimes technical work is done within our various teams
and when this work is presented to a wider audience "cabal"
accusations are made.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no magic way to improve this situation. I
believe a major blocker here is the aggressive attitudes that are
often shown in our development forums, and these need to be curtailed
first. Once we have a healthier atmosphere for discussion, then more
open discussion will happen naturally.</p>

<h3>Technical standards</h3>

<p>In our large repository of software, we have a very large number of
packages and a very large number of maintainers. Most of the work in
Debian is done very well, but unfortunately not all of it. Much has
been said in the past about our developers being volunteers who cannot
be forced to do work that they don't want to. That may excuse people
working slowly on their packages, but it does <strong>not</strong>
excuse some of the sloppiness that happens from time to
time, for example packages that fail to build on a clean system.</p>

<p>We have a growing number of tools that a maintainer can use to check
the quality of their packages (linda, lintian and now piuparts). We
have build tools that can reduce the chance of broken dependencies and
other build-time issues (sbuild, pbuilder, etc.). Yet we still
regularly have broken or low-quality packages uploaded.</p>

<p>There are two issues here, as far as I can see. Some of our
maintainers are not aware of updates that have happened to our tools
and procedures. Some of us don't feel the need to use those newer
tools and methods. Both these issues should be fixable: more
documentation on best-practice packaging and testing methods will
help, both in describing what's available and why they're good.</p>

<h3>Working effectively; asking for help</h3>

<p>Continuing on from the previous point: another part of the DD's job
is to work effectively, both on our individual packages and within the
project as a whole. This includes simple things like handling the bugs
in our packages in a timely fashion, but also includes bigger things,
such as considering the impact of changes on the release
schedule. Working effectively is not just important for our own
gratification; it also makes a major impact on how long we take to
release and the experience our users have with using Debian.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a key part of working effectively is honesty. We can
all suffer from a lack of time to do the jobs that we've promised to
do. After all, real life has a nasty habit of intruding on our
so-called "spare" time. So long as we don't let things delay too far,
we can cope and still contribute. But at some point, we need to be
more honest with ourselves and actually admit that we can't continue
with the jobs that we've promised to do. It's a hard thing to do, but
in a friendly community where we're all working together towards a
common goal there should be <strong>no</strong> shame in asking for
help.</p>

<p>In a larger scope, procedures exist for DDs to temporarily leave
the project if real life has overtaken them, and re-join when the
situation changes. Again, there is no shame in doing this - we should
be happy to acknowledge all the contributions that people have made to
Free Software when they could. But, still, many people don't take this
route and instead simply become missing in action (MIA). It can take
quite a while to pick up on DDs who have simply dropped out of the
project.</p>

<h2>Why vote for me?</h2>

<p>We have a large field of candidates this year, which may make it
difficult for our developers to decide how to vote. I believe I can do
a good job as DPL due to the following qualities:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Experience:</strong> I've been a developer within Debian
for over ten years. I've done large amounts of packaging work, I've
seen Debian evolve a great deal in that time, and I've been involved
in lots of different discussions. My time working as 2IC means I
already know what the DPL job entails, and I'm happy I can do the
job.</li>

<li><strong>Organisation:</strong> Besides packaging, I've done a lot
of promotional work for Debian. I've organised Debian stands at lots
of shows and expos over the years, and I run the debian-uk mailing
list. Both of these help raise awareness of Debian and its goals. I'm
also currently the treasurer of the Debian UK Society. I've had a fair
experience at "cat-herding" so far, including arranging travel for
groups to Debconf, FOSDEM and other events. I've also been leading
some of the work for Debconf 7, specifically sponsorship and
budgeting.</li>

<li><strong>Social:</strong> I'm a programmer, which means I have
strong opinions on many subjects. (*grin*). Despite that, I believe I
am honest, generally approachable and easy to work with. I am a good
communicator and negotiator, and I have made many friends in the
Debian and wider Free Software Community over the years.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I have touched on some issues here that are hopefully not
surprising to most of our community. I must also acknowledge the fact
that the DPL does not have the power to simply impose changes as
he/she sees fit. The best that the DPL can do here is to encourage us
to improve, sometimes by discussion and debate and sometimes by
leading by example. I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe I can
help us to achieve some of the goals I have listed here.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time in reading my platform.</p>

<h2>Rebuttals</h2>

<p>Up front, I should say that (again) I believe this year we have a
selection of good candidates. This is one of the bits of the DPL
election process I like least, as I don't believe in being negative
about other candidates. Nonetheless, I should put some effort in
here. I'd like to be DPL (obviously, otherwise I wouldn't be
standing!) but I'd also be happy enough to see <strong>any</strong>
competent person elected. There is a lot of overlap of ideas, I can
see. Here are my thoughts on the other candidates and their
platforms:</p>

<h3>Wouter Verhelst</h3>

<p>Wouter is well-known, experienced DD whom I consider a friend. We
have met lots of times, at Debconf and FOSDEM meetings amongst
others. He talks about wanting to improve the social core of Debian,
which is something I agree with and wish him the best of luck
with.</p>

<h3>Aigars Mahinovs</h3>

<p>Aigars is something of a dark horse here, with not much history in
Debian that comes to my mind. I must admit that his ideas about
release, a "Distribution Trunk" and the "Old Maintainer Process" don't
do much for me. On configuration file reform I think he has some
useful ideas, but I don't see that as needing DPL work at all. For the
record, I agree with him completely on the trademarks front. The whole
trademarks idea is a mess!</p>

<h3>Gustavo Franco</h3>

<p>Gustavo has a <strong>huge</strong> number of goals listed in his
platform, covering just about every area of Debian that I can see:
release, core teams, the BTS, NM, New processing and much much
more. Good luck with whatever he can achieve out of that big list; I
think he'll need it.</p>

<h3>Sven Luther</h3>

<p>I don't see a platform here.</p>

<h3>Sam Hocevar</h3>

<p>I had been unimpressed in the last year by Sam's attempts to make
humour out of problems in Debian, so I did not expect to see much
here. However, his platform does have a lot of positive ideas on how
to improve things and I hope he can deliver on some of them.</p>

<h3>Raphaël Hertzog</h3>

<p>Raphaël has a good history of contributing to Debian, probably most
famously for lots of work on Alioth. He and I have worked together in
the past, and his suggested goals sound entirely reasonable. His main
push is for a DPL board, an idea that I'm not 100% convinced
about. Despite that, I have offered to serve on his board in the case
he might be elected - after all, the DPL job will still need doing and
I'll be happy to help.</p>

<h3>Anthony Towns</h3>

<p>AJ and I have worked together quite a lot over the last year as DPL
and 2IC. It's been very productive, and I thank him for the
opportunity to help. He talks this year about technology, community
and getting things done, all major topics. I know AJ can deliver on
DPL work, and I wish him the best of luck again in the competition
this year.</p>

<h3>Simon Richter</h3>

<p>I'm not sure what to make of Simon's ideas. He lists problems in
his platform, but I don't see any proposals on how to fix them.</p>
