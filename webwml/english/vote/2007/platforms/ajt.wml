<h2>Platform for Anthony Towns</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>

<p>Hello! Here's my platform!

<p>My notes tell me I should keep this simple, so I'm going to just
list a few general themes for the next year and the specific things I've
been thinking of doing to work on them over the coming year. I've also
included a summary of things that happened during my term as DPL this
past year.

<p>Outside of Debian, I'm pretty involved in <a
href="http://www.linux.org.au/">Linux Australia</a> stuff, and
this year I'm also involved with the planning for the 2007 <a
href="http://arjen-lentz.livejournal.com/87378.html">Open Source
Developers Conference</a>. I've generally found this to be more symbiotic
with my involvement in Debian than competing for time, but along with
my plans to seriously investigate free accounting software over the next
year, I expect I'll need to be more careful in rationing my time than I
have been this past year.

<p>To that end, if re-elected, I'll be extending the "2IC" concept into
having a handful of "assisting leaders" who each have their own projects
and the authority to implement them, and can respond to interview
requests and the like, to otherwise share the load. I'm hoping some
of the other candidates will be willing to consider that role if I get
re-elected, and likewise I'm happy to volunteer for a role like that if
I'm not DPL. Ideally, I'd hope that some of the other candidates could
get some of their projects done equally well in that sort of role, and
at the same time have a more gentle introduction to being DPL than we
usually have. Ideally, I'd like to run again next year against three or
four co-DPLs who I'd worked with this coming year, lose to one of them,
and have whoever that is invite us all back to work together in 2008,
under their direction.

<p>I have a <a href="http://azure.humbug.org.au/~aj/blog/">blog</a>, and
my platforms from <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2005/platforms/ajt">2005</a>
and <a href="http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/platforms/ajt">2006</a> are also
available.

<h3>DPL Review - April 2006 to February 2007</h3>

<p>My goals for last year were Vitality, Recruiting and Direction. As far
as "vitality" goes, I think the last year's gone fairly well. There's
been lots of interesting things going on, and by and large even the
major arguments we've had have at least been about new things, rather
than another repeat of the same old debates.

<p>Our "recruiting" hasn't been as successful as I would have liked --
it's still a major process to add a new developer, and there's still
not enough room for people who want to contribute but can't make the
commitment to become a full developer. We've had some success at working
with other organisations, both through SPI and directly, but I think we
could be doing a lot better on those too.

<p>We've had a bit of success at thinking about Debian's "direction"
outside of just DPL elections -- though given some of the evidence of that
is a DPL recall vote, maybe that's not a success I should brag about... :)

</ul>

<p>That's not remotely complete, and many of those items weren't limited
to just one month, but it's probably useful as an idea of what's been
going on. Obviously there's been plenty of stuff happening that hasn't
involved me in any way too!

<hr>

<p>Anyway, on to this year's themes.

<h3>Technology</h3>

<p>The most important thing about Debian is its technology -- the clever
ideas we've come up with to make things work better. Whether that be
software we've written to make our packages work better, our packaging
system ourself, our and others' licensing hacks to encourage a positive
feedback loop of improvements, the procedures and policy documents
we've come up with to make maintaining high quality software easier,
or the organisational structures we've invented to let us operate as
a distributed global organisation in a world that expects us to be
centralised and insular.

<p>Of course, most of the technology improvements for Debian don't
(and shouldn't) involve the project leader. There is a role the DPL can
play though -- and that's in setting an example of constantly working
on their own technical improvements, and in so doing encouraging others
to do the same.

<p>I did a lot of technical things in 2005 -- including working on
pdiffs for apt, cross-arch debootstrapping, a whole bunch of debbugs
hacking including usertags, usercategories and pretty CSS, some neat
memory improvements to britney, support for the testing security team
to use security.debian.org without needing vendor-sec priveleges, some
work on getting the archive able to accept amd64 and a few other things.

<p>Since getting elected, I haven't done much coding-level stuff at all;
there's been some follow-on stuff for keeping amd64 in shape and helping
the release team out, there's been moving ftp-master to its new host,
and a few more updates for the testing security support as it began to
get some use. I do think some of the stuff I've been doing instead is
"technical" in a meaningful sense, including working with SPI to make
it more effective, getting Debian involved in Google's Summer of Code,
working on trademark licenses, and helping people form organisations
and run events in Debian's name; but ultimately Debian's a free
<b>software</b> organisation, and we ought to be more visible for our
software than the stuff around it.

<p>So personally, the technical stuff I'm planning on
working on over the next few months are Joey Hess's new <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/jetring/">jetring</a> keyring
management tool; dak (the Debian Archive Kit), for which I'm hoping we
can get some neat improvements underway during debcamp/debconf; and the
still pending review of dunc-tank's release management stuff.

<p>Beyond that, I'm hoping that we'll be able to emphasise our technical
work better during the coming year due to a bunch of things, including
the release of etch, policy development for lenny, improved QA tests
and integration, and other neat work that gets done.

<h3>Community</h3>

<p>"Community" is probably the primary buzzword for Linux Australia --
we try to keep our activities focussed on community activities, whether
that be the user community or the developer community or something
else. That's been a really effective focus for us, in making sure we
welcome new members, that we keep giving feedback to our members, that
we're accessible to everyone involved in the Australian Linux community
whether they're members or not, that our activities are focussed on
benefiting the community, rather than particular important projects,
and so on.

<p>I've tended to avoid putting the same emphasis on community within
Debian, because I suspect a lot of people will just think of it as nothing
more than a buzzword or a marketing ploy or an attempt to silence anyone
who doesn't agree with me as "not a part of the community". But there's
no point avoiding it: Debian does have a huge and vibrant community, and
even if there are major disagreements going on throughout that community,
it's still the community -- of developers, users, advocates, businesses,
upstreams, derivatives, competitors and ultimately everyone working on
Linux and free software -- that makes Debian thrive. Ultimately that's
something that deserves to be recognised, because software, like freedom,
can't exist without people to create it and maintain it.

<p>I'd thus intend to stay involved with 
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a> and
helping it work with other organisations such as OFTC, PostgreSQL and
FreeDesktop.org to help build and maintain ties with those organisations.
SPI have done an excellent job of getting their house in order lately, and
in my view, should become a truly excellent resource for free software
groups, given some more support from its existing member projects,
including Debian.

<p>One person can only do so much, though, so based on some recent
comments from Martin Michlmayr, I think it's also worthwhile to nominate
some developers as "Debian Ambassadors". The idea would be that they'd
be people who regulary promote Debian at conferences and tradeshows, or
participate in industry groups or attend development summits as Debian's
representative, and Debian would support that by helping with travel
costs or helping make sure they've got CDs and such to give away. I'd
expect that to include the DPL and other members of the leadership team,
and as such would expect to authorise flight reimbursements -- which is
something I've not been willing to do for myself this past year.

<p>As I <a href="http://azure.humbug.org.au/~aj/blog/2006/04/12">wrote
about last year</a>, I think we need to expand our development community
to allow maintainers that are currently sponsored to participate more
directly. I'm hopeful that jetring will turn out to be the major missing
piece in that proposal, but we'll see what happens.

<p>Beyond that, I think it's important to keep supporting other community
based activities, such as local or regional Debian conferences, work
meetings, the <a href="http://forums.debian.net/">unofficial Debian
user forums</a>, or new initiatives like Holger Levsen's proposed <a
href="http://debian-community.org/">Debian-Community.org</a>.

<h3>Just Do It</h3>

<p>Over the past year, and to a lesser extent for a fair while before
then, I've spent a fair amount of time trying to explain to folks who
complain about the way Debian works what (in my experience) are the most
effective ways to actually achieve the changes you want to see, and to
discourage them from trying to communicate their desires in ways that
(in my opinion) cause more harm than good.

<p>As far as I've seen, that's had no productive effect -- ultimately
developers' attention is a limited and valuable resource and it's
better to spend it on creating good things and working with people who
are productive and helpful than repeating the same arguments with the
same people.

<p>Personally, there are plenty of things I can see in Debian that need
improving, and I think it'll be better all round if I spend my time
working on them, than trying to get everyone to understand my priorities.
YMMV, and I might not have explained that very well -- but, well, that's
kinda the point. :)
