               Debian uses the Condorcet method voting.
               Simplistically, plain Condorcets method
               can be stated like so : <br/>
               <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
                  The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
                  candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
                  race with that candidate.</q>
               The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
               be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
               and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
               various means of resolving the tie. See
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
               for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
               <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
               specifically,  A.6.
