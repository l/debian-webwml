<A NAME="sec:whyrunning"></A></P><P>My general motivations for running for DPL are
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc3">well explained</A> in
my platform from last year. They are all still valid and motivating reasons for
me to serve as DPL for another year.</P><P>Further more, I've experienced that serving as DPL is a task with a rather long
<EM>bootstrap time</EM>. At the beginning of the term one needs to find the right
balance among several tasks, like following what's happening in the community,
document and communicate about DPL whereabouts, decide when to intervene and
when to stay put, as well as getting to know a whole lot of external people
(representatives of other distributions and companies, non-profit
organizations, lawyers, public administrations, journalists, etc.) and
<EM>vice-versa</EM> let all these people know you. The bootstrap time is useful
to <q>learn the job</q> but can last several months. For the next term, I'd like
to build upon the experience I've accumulated to be more effective in helping
the Debian community from day 1.</P><P>I'm also seeking re-election because, while I'm happy of several changes that
have happened in Debian in the last year (thanks not to me, but to way more
people than I could possibly list here), I've also accumulated more TODO items
on my DPL agenda than what could be possibly addressed in the remainder of this
term.</P><!--TOC section My goals-->

<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->The role of Debian</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
The ecosystem of Free Software is vast and growing. Every active distribution
in there should be well aware of its own purpose and distinguishing traits.
During the present term I've communicated about the role of Debian observing
that we offer a set of pretty rare, if not unique, features among mainstream
FOSS distributions. Those features consist of a mix of technical and
<q>political</q> aspects: (1) a focus on package quality, with no distinction
among first and second class packages; (2) a strong culture of software
freedom, which refuses to offer non-free software by default to users and
distribution developers (as parts of the infrastructure used to make Debian);
(3) independence from commercial interests, with no single company or entity
that could claim to babysit Debian; and (4) a decision making model based on a
weighted sum of do-ocracy and democracy, which implies that by doing (rather
than talking) everyone has a chance to have an impact on Debian.</P><P>I believe the above traits turn Debian into a rather unique and fundamental
contributor to Free Software and I intend to continue to present the Project
that way, both to the Debian community and to external stakeholders. For more
information on this aspect, you might want to check the blog post

<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Contributing to Debian</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
Last year, I've campaigned on the topic of
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc5">more gradual and
rewarding access paths</A> to Debian. During the past year, we marked a
significant advancement on that topic by
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/vote_002">welcoming non-packaging
contributors</A> in our Project. I'm convinced that in the long run that will
prove to be a more important change than what we realize at present; it has the
potential of turning the monoculture we used to be into the massively varied
culture we <EM>need</EM> to be to be faithful to our vocation of universality.
Even though technically non-packaging DD have existed before, voting on that
change we have not only communicated to the world that Debian values all kind
of contributions equally, but we have also invited all potential contributors
to join our do-ocracy with their contributions. I've been glad to discover that
several applicants have already answered to that invitation.</P><P>More generally, we need to make it easier to contribute to Debian with
non-packaging contributions such as documentation, bug triaging, testing,
translations, etc. Talking with potential contributions, I still have the
impression that whether we are able or not to retain a potential contributor,
depends too much on whether or not she will be lucky enough to talk with the
<q>right person</q>. If it is the rule, such a scenario is highly suboptimal. One
way to ease contribution is learning some tricks from other distributions
which, for instance, have since a while decided to present <q>how to
contribute</q> documentation on a per-profile basis (see #608400).</P><!--TOC paragraph Collaborative maintenance and NMUs-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Collaborative maintenance and NMUs</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
I've been a fan of teams and collaborative maintenance since the very
beginning. Rest assured that I haven't changed my mind about that
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc5">since last year</A>.
In fact, I'm becoming a bit more radical and I've been campaigning more and
more for (properly done!) NMUs, as documented in
<A HREF="http://upsilon.cc/~zack/hacking/debian/rcbw/">the motivations</A> of the
RCBW initiative. I believe that (properly done!) NMUs are the best tools we
have to fight inertia and counter the negative effects of excessive code
ownership. Our
<A HREF="$(DOC)/developers-reference/pkgs.html#nmu">current
guidelines for NMUs</A> are in fact quite liberal and permit to cover up for MIA
or negligent maintainers, provided they are put in the best possible conditions
to catch up with NMU work later on. I'll keep on advertising for NMU practices
whenever needed.</P><!--TOC paragraph Vocal minorities-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Vocal minorities</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
Last year I've campaigned about polls as a mean to solve issues with
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc5">vocal minorities</A>
on Debian mailing list. I still believe polls are a potentially useful tool,
but I haven't seen the need of using it during the past year. Rather, several
people &mdash; including myself &mdash; have chimed in relevant threads to point out that
non-constructive comments from people who are not in charge of specific project
areas are useless according to our Constitution. We have also amended our
mailing list code of conduct accordingly (see #610262).</P><!--TOC paragraph Face-to-face meeting-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Face-to-face meetings</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
Last year I've also campaigned for
<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc5">face-to-face
meetings</A>. I'm glad to report that we now have an informal process and
documentation in place for <A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/Sprints">sprints</A> and
that we have had 10 sprints in this term, with 2 more forthcoming before its
end.</P><!--TOC paragraph Derivatives-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Derivatives</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
We have worked quite a bit with derivatives during the past year, with
initiatives like the
<A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/DerivativesFrontDesk">derivatives front desk</A> and
<A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/Derivatives/Census">census</A>. I've also been
present as a Debian representative at several meetings of derivatives
distribution. There, I've campaigned for a vision of upstream-downstream
relationships which is no longer composed by only two actors (one upstream, one
downstream), but rather by a long chain of software vendors where every vendor
has: direct users, benefits from upstreams, and acts as a platform for several
downstreams. In order to pursue the interests of Free Software &mdash; for those who,
like us, care about that &mdash; every actor should give credit to their upstreams
and make efforts to push patches back to them. In the specific case of Debian
we should:
</P><OL CLASS="enumerate"><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
<EM>be exemplar in our giving back practices</EM>, for example by tracking
publicly our efforts in sending patches upstream;</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate"><EM>make as easy as possible to give back to us</EM>, for example by
participating in cross-distribution initiatives and by NMU-ing packages when
important downstream patches lay unattended in the BTS.
</LI></OL><P>
Doing both will strengthen our give back <EM>requests</EM> to derivatives that we
should not stop posing.</P><!--TOC subsection Interaction with the project-->

<A HREF="$(VOTE)/2010/platforms/zack#htoc6">engaged myself</A> to
periodically disclose DPL activities. During the term, I've ended up
implementing a specific scheme for doing that; it has worked well for me and I
plan to reiterate it. In short, daily bits are taken about my DPL activities
and made available to Debian Developers via a project machine, usually on a
weekly basis. Monthly, those bits are summarized in a <q>bits from the DPL</q>
mail sent to <TT>d-d-a</TT>. For formal stuff like delegations or other
noteworthy activities separate mails are sent to <TT>d-d-a</TT> as well.</P><P>Doing the above takes time which is taken away from other DPL activities. When
faced with the dilemma, I've favored ditching some DPL tasks and communicating
or taking notes about the others, instead of the other way around. I intend to
do the same during the next term.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Money-->

<A NAME="sec:money"></A></P><P>Since last year we have got better in our transparency in money management (for
instance we now have <A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Auditor">an index</A> of
Debian trusted organizations with pointers to their reports), but we still have
a long way to go to be properly accountable to our donors. As an ideal goal, we
should aim for a quarterly report about our finances, which includes assets
from all Debian trusted organizations and all money flows since the last
reporting period. I've also come to realize that for the DPL, dealing with
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Cash_Method_and_Accrual_Method_of_accounting#Cash_basis">cash-based
accounting</A> is a pain, since it comes in conjunction with a multitude of
organizations to monitor. Switching to cross-organization,
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Cash_Method_and_Accrual_Method_of_accounting#Accrual_basis">accrual-based
accounting</A> is a much needed feature to ease expense planning and transitions
from one DPL to the next.</P><P>On both aspects &mdash; quarterly reports and accrual-based accounting &mdash; I've been
hearing about progress from the auditors and I'll do my best to help them out
in delivering.</P><!--TOC subsection Specific plans-->

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc13">2.3.3</A>  Companies</H4><!--SEC END --><P>During this term I've heard too often complains from small/medium companies

on you as you're too small, we want a labeled <EM>support network</EM></q>.</P><P>I intend to investigate ways to help those companies to get in touch with each
other to see if they can join forces to address some of those issues. On the

(some of) them into a Debian user poll to be run yearly, as many other Free
Software projects are doing to gather actual feedback from their users. Similar
spontaneous initiatives have been proposed in the past, but they have been
either quite narrow (e.g. without coordination with Debian official
communication channels which can reach out to a large public) or not suitable

achievement of the webmaster team in revamping the layout of the Debian website
together with the release of Squeeze.</P><P>We need to continue this trend and use social communications, where it is
compatible with our Free Software principles, to reach out to our potential
public. For instance, Debian still lacks an official blog to be used as a
communication channel to our community in less formal terms than press
releases. Recently the closest approximation we had of
it &mdash; <A HREF="http://news.debian.net"><TT>http://news.debian.net</TT></A> &mdash; has been closed down. From a communication
point of view that is a pity, given that the other communication channels we
have do not enable users to easily give feedback on news items by means of
comments, trackbacks, and the like. I intend to work on fixing this and, more
generally, to remain involved in the publicity team as I've been during this
term.</P><!--TOC subsubsection Local teams-->
<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc16">2.3.6</A>  Local teams</H4><!--SEC END --><P>Debian lacks a structured network of local teams / Debian user groups. I've
come to realize this during the present term pretty quickly, as soon as people
started asking me questions like <q>who should we contact for an event in
$city?</q> or <q>do you know about periodic Debian-related meetings in $city we
can attend?</q>. We have some answers about that, like the
<TT>debian-events-*</TT> mailing lists and the recently revamped
<A HREF="https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/Events">event teams</A>, but they are no
substitute for a network of local teams.</P><P>Other distributions have established similar networks and their experiences
seem to show that they are useful not only as local contact points for events,
but also as starting circles that help users becoming gradually more and more
involved with the distribution. I think we should consider something similar
for Debian. I've mentioned the idea from time to time to the local communities
I've visited for talks and generally the feedback has been very positive.</P><!--TOC section Additional info-->

seriously. For the duration of the mandate I will keep on hold my other Debian
tasks, as I've done in the present term: it is an obligation towards former
co-workers and a fair deal to avoid burning out.</P><P>On the same topic and for the sake of clarity: some DPL candidates have in the
past declared their ability to act as DPL full-time. I cannot grant that. What
I offer is my Debian time as a volunteer, to be fully dedicated to DPL
tasks. Luckily, I have at present a very
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberto_Di_Cosmo">FOSS-sensitive boss</A> who
has been very supportive of my DPL activities during this term. I have been
able to enjoy the freedom to reorganize my schedule for urgencies and/or longer
activities, such as traveling for Debian-related reasons.</P><P>I can count on similar arrangements for the first 6 months of the forthcoming
term. For the remaining 6 months I still don't know yet, as it's not clear yet
who will be my employer by then. Nonetheless, in all possible employment
scenarios I can imagine at the time of writing, I'm confident that I will be
able to find the time needed to carry on my DPL duties. If at any time I will
realize that is no longer the case, I will immediately resign from DPL.</P><P>Like most of us, I'm generally available not only via email, but also on IRC,
phone, etc.</P><!--CUT END -->
