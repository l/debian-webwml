             <p>
                The ballot, when ready, can be requested through email
                by sending a signed email to
                <a href="mailto:ballot@vote.debian.org">ballot@vote.debian.org</a>
                with the subject leader2011.
             </p>

          <vstatistics />
          <p> 
            This year, like always, 
		<a href="suppl_001_stats">statistics</a>
             will be gathered about ballots received and
             acknowledgements sent periodically during the voting
             period.
		Additionally, the list of <a
             href="vote_001_voters.txt">voters</a> will be
             recorded. Also, the <a href="vote_001_tally.txt">tally
             sheet</a> will also be made available to be viewed.
             Please remember that the project leader election has a
             secret ballot, so the tally sheet will be produced with
             the hash of the alias of the voter rather than the name;
             the alias shall be sent to the corresponding voter along
             with the acknowledgement of the ballot so that people may
             verify that their votes were correctly tabulated. While
             the voting is open the tally will be a dummy one; after
             the vote, the final tally sheet will be put in
             place. Please note that for secret ballots the md5sum on
             the dummy tally sheet is randomly generated, as otherwise
             the dummy tally sheet would leak information relating the
             md5 hash and the voter.
         </p>
