#            This year, like always, 
#             <!-- id="http://master.debian.org/~secretary/leader2009/" --> <a
#             href="suppl_001_stats">statistics</a>
#             will be gathered about ballots received and
#             acknowledgements sent periodically during the voting
#             period.  Additionally, the list of <a
#             href="vote_001_voters.txt">voters</a> will be
#             recorded. Also, the <a href="vote_001_tally.txt">tally
#             sheet</a> will also be made available to be viewed.
#             Please remember that the project leader election has a
#             secret ballot, so the tally sheet will be produced with
#             the hash of the alias of the voter rather than the name;
#             the alias shall be sent to the corresponding voter along
#             with the acknowledgement of the ballot so that people may
#             verify that their votes were correctly tabulated. While
#             the voting is open the tally will be a dummy one; after
#             the vote, the final tally sheet will be put in
#             place. Please note that for secret ballots the md5sum on
#             the dummy tally sheet is randomly generated, as otherwise
#             the dummy tally sheet would leak information relating the
#             md5 hash and the voter.
