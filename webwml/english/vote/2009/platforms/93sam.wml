<h1>Steve McIntyre's DPL platform, 2009</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I've been a Debian Developer since October 1996. I originally
joined to maintain the Debian version of mikmod; I was the upstream
developer at the time, and wanted the Debian version to work well
too. In those days, the NM process was rather simpler than today: I
installed Debian, then two days later I mailed Bruce Perens with a PGP
key and asked him for a Debian login. He responded almost immediately
with account details - I was in!</p>

<p>Since that point, I've worked on quite a wide range of packages,
some large and some small. Probably the most noticeable technical work
I've done for Debian is within the debian-cd team, both developing the
debian-cd software itself and using that same software to create the
official CDs, DVDs and Blu-ray disks that accompany each Debian
release. I've been involved with the CDs for almost every major and
point release since Hamm.</p>

<p>I host two of our buildds (ball and toffee), and help with local
admin work on two more (cats and grieg). I also keep my own little
farm of machines covering the majority of our architectures. This
helps me to debug problems in my own packages, and I give out accounts
to other DDs as well where helpful.</p>

<h2>Standing for re-election</h2>

<p>I am the current DPL, and I am standing for re-election this
year. I believe that I have done a reasonable job for the project in
the last year, concentrating on three major themes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Teamwork - I organised a review of how the various teams in Debian
were performing, running a survey and then working through the results
of that survey. In several places where they indicated that core teams
were not working as well as we needed/expected, I helped the people
involved to bring in new blood or to improve working methods as
appropriate. I've also enocuraged people to meet face-to-face where it
has helped, and I have spent Debian money to help achieve that when
needed. I'm not going to claim all the credit for the improvements
that have happened in the last year, but I'm happy that Debian as an
organisation is in much better shape now than at this point last
year.</li>

<li>Internal communications - I've spent a lot of time this year
talking with Debian folks: encouraging them to spread the news about
what they're working on, what they need help with, what problems
they're facing. I haven't quite posted as many "Bits from the DPL"
mails as I'd have hoped for this year, and for that I apologise:
sometimes there just aren't enough hours in the day. More about that
later! I have also helped solve a number of disagreements this year,
mediating in arguments before they cause real problems.</li>

<li>External communications - I've represented Debian a lot of
times. This includes talking to the press multiple times: about being
elected, about problems in Debian and how we solve them, and about
Lenny and why they should care about it. I have presented several
talks about Debian to a variety of audiences, and I have been involved
in multiple discussions with other FLOSS projects including some of
the other Linux distributions.</li>

</ul>

<p>There's more to the job too, more than I can really cover in this
space. I gave a <a
href="http://www.einval.com/~steve/talks/FOSDEM2009/">talk at
FOSDEM</a> last month about this if you're interested in more details,
and the video team captured it on <a
href="http://meetings-archive.debian.net/Public/debian-meetings/2009/fosdem/high/What_does_the_DPL_do.ogg">video</a> too.</p>

<h2>Standing with an assistant - Luk Claes</h2>

<p>One thing I have learnt in the last year is that the DPL job is a
big one. To do the job effectively takes up a lot of time: in my
opinion more time than one single person will have, unless they are a
student or they have a <strong>very</strong> accommodating
employer. Due to this, I did not manage to make as much progress on my
goals as I hoped for in the last year and so I'm changing my plans a
little. I have asked Luk Claes to join me as an assistant DPL this
year if I'm elected, and he has accepted my invitation.</p>

<p>Luk started contributing to Debian in 2003 and became a DD in
2005. He soon joined the release team to help prepare the release of
Etch, and following Etch he continued on as part of that team. He was
one of the two RMs for Lenny and is staying with the job for
Squeeze. Besides working on the release, he has also recently joined
the new buildd infrastructure team. On top of his various other Debian
related commitments, he is an elected board member of Software in the
Public Interest, our main legal and financial umbrella.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Much of this platform will be familiar to people, as it is largely
based on what I have said at this time in previous years. Many of the
things I want to work on in Debian are well known problems, issues
that have affected us for a long time. The two main ones that I see
are:</p>

<h3>Communications within the project</h3>

<p>This is a long-term bugbear; DPL candidates have been promising to
work on improving communication within the project for as long as I
can remember. There are several places where communication has been
problematic in the past. I believe I have already helped with this in
the past, but there is more still to be done.</p>

<p>I'm convinced that the more we talk about what we're doing, the
more motivated others will be to help us in our tasks. A vibrant,
open, friendly project depends on the periodic introduction of fresh
blood wanting to work with us. Let's make that easier!</p>

<h3>Working effectively; asking for help</h3>

<p>Continuing on from the previous point: another part of the DD's job
is to work effectively, both on individual packages and within the
project as a whole. This includes simple things like handling the bugs
in our packages in a timely fashion, but also includes bigger things,
such as considering the impact of changes on the release
schedule. Working effectively is not just important for our own
gratification; it also makes a major impact on how long we take to
release and the experience our users have with using Debian.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a key part of working effectively is honesty. We can
all suffer from a lack of time to do the jobs that we've promised to
do. After all, real life has a nasty habit of intruding on our
so-called "spare" time. So long as we don't let things delay too far,
we can cope and still contribute. But at some point, we need to be
more honest with ourselves and actually admit that we can't continue
with the jobs that we've promised to do. It's a hard thing to do, but
in a friendly community where we're all working together towards a
common goal there should be <strong>no</strong> shame in asking for
help.</p>

<p>In a larger scope, procedures exist for DDs to temporarily leave
the project if real life has overtaken them, and re-join when the
situation changes. Again, there is no shame in doing this - we should
be happy to acknowledge all the contributions that people have made to
Free Software when they could. But, still, many people don't take this
route and instead simply become missing in action (MIA). It can take
quite a while to pick up on DDs who have simply dropped out of the
project.</p>

<h3>How to fix these, aka "getting things done"</h3>

<p>I want to see improvements made where they are clearly needed.
There are cases where communications are lacking, or people and teams
might not be working as effectively as they want to or need to. In
those cases, I want to help and encourage the people involved to make
those improvements. If that is not enough, then we may need stronger
actions.</p>

<p>This goes for all of us, both as individuals and as a
project. Sometimes it can be all too easy to let nay-sayers slow us
down or discourage us from working on the projects that interest
us. If people are not contributing, ask them to help. If they don't
want to help, then ignore them and find others who will. Let's keep
Debian what it should be - a great, thriving community of people
having fun by working together on our shared goals.</p>

<h2>Why vote for me?</h2>

<p>I believe I can continue to do a good job as DPL due to the
following qualities:</p>

<h3>Experience</h3>

<p>I've been a developer within Debian for over twelve years. I've
done large amounts of packaging work, I've seen Debian evolve a great
deal in that time, and I've been involved in lots of different
discussions. My time working as DPL this year means I already have a
good insight into what the DPL job entails, and I'm happy I can do
it. I'm also aware of just how big the job is, which is why I have
asked Luk to help me.</p>

<h3>Organisation</h3>

<p>Besides packaging, I've done a lot of promotional work for
Debian. I've organised Debian stands at lots of shows and expos over
the years. I've been an admin and a mentor for Debian in the Google
Summer of Code for three years running and hopefully for a fourth:
fingers crossed! I have been running the sponsorship team for Debconf
for several years, meaning I've been actively going out and talking
with a variety of companies and other organisations, promoting Debian
and asking them to support us publically. All of these help raise
awareness of Debian and its goals.</p>

<p>I've had a fair experience at "cat-herding" so far, including
arranging travel for groups to Debconf, FOSDEM and other events. I'm
currently the treasurer of the Debian UK Society, and I run the
debian-uk mailing list.</p>

<h3>Social</h3>

<p>I'm a programmer, which means I have strong opinions on many
subjects. (*grin*). Despite that, I believe I am honest, generally
approachable and easy to work with. I am a good communicator and
negotiator, and I have made many friends in the Debian and wider Free
Software Community over the years.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I have touched on some issues here that are hopefully not
surprising to most of our community. I must also acknowledge the fact
that the DPL mostly does not have the power to simply impose changes
as he/she sees fit. The best that the DPL can do here is to encourage
us to improve, sometimes by discussion and debate and sometimes by
leading by example. I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe I can
continue helping us achieve some of the goals I have listed here.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time in reading my platform, and I hope you will
support me in my goals.</p>

<h2>Rebuttals</h2>

<p>   Well, this year there's not very much to say here as there is only one other candidate.
   Stefano is a nice guy and a good developer and when I've worked with him in the past it's
   been a pleasure. He makes a lot of reasonable, sensible points in his platform and I
   applaud him for that.

<p>   I only have two concerns. I'm not sure he will have the time to do what he's planning: time
   always runs away more quickly than you expect. :-)

<p>   Stefano also says he'll probably appoint a 2IC if elected. That I can understand
   completely, but I'd be personally much happier if he was to name his proposed assistant
   before the election. I deliberately did that with Luk, as I want people to be able to vote
   for a known quantity rather than somebody unnamed.

<p>   That's it, really. Good luck to Stefano in the election and I hope the new DPL (be it me or
   him!) will do a good job for Debian.
