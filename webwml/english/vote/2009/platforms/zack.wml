exciting Debian discussions. I mainly work on the

techniques such as formal methods to the study of FOSS
distributions, including but not limited to Debian, and to the
improvement of upgrade planning algorithms. Mancoosi is the

<A NAME="sec:whyrunning"></A></P><P>Being the DPL is about two distinct aspects: the institutional role
and a set of extra goals the prospective DPL wants to pursue during
the term. This distinction matters.</P><P>The institutional role is
<A HREF="$(DEVEL)/constitution#5">described in our
constitution</A> and is about three tasks: ordinary and extraordinary
decision making, public relations with the outside world, and leading
discussions inside the project.</P><P>My personal view of why we need a DPL builds on the observation that
we operate as a do-ocracy: anyone willing to do things can decide what
and how they are done, and no one can be forced to do anything. Given
our size, we have the irresistible tendency of turning into an
<EM>imperfect</EM> do-ocracy:
</P><DIV CLASS="alphaenum">
<OL CLASS="enumerate"><LI CLASS="li-enumerate"> 
access restrictions get added to inhibit people doing
potentially dangerous actions;
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">non-exciting tasks can rot because nobody is motivated enough to
take care of them;
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">those in acquired positions may neglect their duties and lower
the quality of the service they offer, because they do not admit
they are no longer fit for the task.
</LI></OL>
</DIV><P>
The DPL has the duty, for a <EM>limited amount of time</EM>, to mitigate
the imperfections of our do-ocracy:
</P><DIV CLASS="alphaenum">
<OL CLASS="enumerate"><LI CLASS="li-enumerate"> 
spot overly constraining access restrictions which inhibit
capable people to work, inducing inefficiencies and frustration;
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">find people willing to do non-exciting tasks for the project's
global good (making sure they get credit for it);
</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">assign people to key positions to improve service quality inside
and outside the project.
</LI></OL>
</DIV><P>
The reward is the occasion to push for project-wide improvements by
the only virtue of occupying the DPL position.</P><P>I want to challenge myself to be a transparent and present DPL, and to
improve the mechanisms of our project. That is why I'm running for
DPL. (Actually, I've also been <EM>asked</EM> by some of you to
run, so the blame for bothering you in reading all this does not
fall exclusively on me <TT>:-)</TT></P><!--TOC section My goals-->

The introduction of <A HREF="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">DMs</A>
(Debian Maintainers) has been a fortunate event for Debian. Some
people argue that it has opened up our archive to packages of
sub-standard quality. That might be true, but we also have (plenty of)
sub-standard packages maintained by full-fledged maintainers who have
lost their interest in Debian. The solution to both is <EM>more QA</EM>.</P><P>Through the DM process, many enthusiastic people have found their way
into Debian, increasing our work force. In addition, the DM process
induces a <EM>more controlled process</EM> to become a full-fledged DD,
with greater insurance of serious commitment to Debian, and experience
levels. All in all, the DM process is a more fine-grained access path
to Debian than what we had before it, which enables us to give back to
our contributors <EM>gradually</EM> through recognition. Contributing to
Debian is no longer all-or-nothing, it is now way less frustrating for
packagers, who previously might have turned their efforts to other
projects.</P><P>We need to generalize the lessons learned from the DM process. We have
a lot of potential valuable contributors out there. They just need
better documentation about <EM>how</EM> to join. They simply demand
something in exchange, to be proud of, that acknowledges their
efforts. I do not have preconceptions on the different ways of
achieving this (e.g., ACLs vs linearly increasing privileges), but we
need to go in that direction. In doing so, we should also relax our
implicit assumptions that <EM>only</EM> technical abilities matter in
Debian. The truly "Universal Operating System" is <EM>mainly</EM>, not
only, made of software; it is also made of translations, graphics,
musics, etc.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">

</DIV><!--TOC paragraph Collaborative maintenance-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Collaborative maintenance</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
The introduction of the <TT>Uploaders:</TT> field is another example of
a fortunate development in Debian. While it can, in principle, form
teams of people with no clear responsibility for specific tasks, on
average it works very well. It creates efficient technical spaces for
collaboration on specific topics, and it also scales through
(re)creating organizational structures with specific position and
task-assignments.</P><P>Collaborative maintenance should not be mandatory (we do have several
very efficient one-man-band developers), but should be our
default. Packaging newbies should start in collaborative maintenance
teams and gain experience there. Team member feedback can then be
useful to take some of the weight off the shoulders of the AMs
(Application Managers). Similarly, we should not accept one-man-band
maintenance when it comes with de facto unmaintained packages (to be
identified with
<A HREF="http://wiki.debian.org/qa.debian.org/bapase">suitable QA
activities</A>). In those cases, we should suggest--or even force if
needed--collaborative maintenance. It can provide a more acceptable
exit strategy than public, yet useless, shaming.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">
<DIV CLASS="center"><I>I will push to diminish </I><I><EM>strong package
ownership</EM></I><I> when it conflicts with package quality.</I></DIV>
</DIV><!--TOC paragraph Vocal minorities-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Vocal minorities</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
Our mailing lists have substantially improved over the last 5
years. Every now and then though, they get polluted by (apparently)
very vocal minorities capable of polarizing discussions, which is
neither productive, nor fun. Given how we are attached to our
community, we sometime take part in such discussions, inevitably
burning out (how frequent are temporary VAC messages due to this? Too
much). My take: </P><BLOCKQUOTE CLASS="quote"> <p><I>Freedom of speech: good.<BR>
Vocal
minorities holding hostage the silent majorities: bad.</I></p></BLOCKQUOTE><P>While we should consider--and have actually applied in the
past--moderation measures to counter repeated community disrupting
behaviors, we cannot take the risk of applying them only on the
<EM>assumption</EM> that the posters actually are a vocal minority.
Even though there are no optimal solutions for this kind of problems,
technical devices can help. One such device I want to put into use are
<A HREF="http://master.debian.org/~jeroen/polls/">polls</A>, as proposed by
Jeroen van Wolffelaar and other years ago. The intention is to enable
every DD to start mail-based, authenticated polls <EM>à la</EM>
<TT>devotee</TT>.</P><P>Polls can give a reasonable idea where the community stands, without
having to engage the whole GR (General Resolution) machinery. A poll
can either make it clear to participants in discussions (or flame
fests) that they are in disagreement with the rest of the project and
better stop beating the dying horse, or indicate that they are on the
right path.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">
<DIV CLASS="center"><I>To resolve the impasse of vocal
minorities, I will apply mechanisms that make rough </I><I><EM>consensus</EM></I><I>
emerge when it exists.</I></DIV>
</DIV><!--TOC paragraph Face-to-face meetings-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Face-to-face meetings</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
Meetings are essential to improve the quality of collaboration within
the project, no matter how good we are in communicating digitally. Get
together face to face, hack for hours, do stuff together, and get back
home. The day after, your remote collaboration will be better.</P><P>Helping the organization of meetings is a wonderful way of spending
Debian money or other investing resources, such as specifically
appointed people. Luckily we do have
<A HREF="http://www.debconf.org">DebConf</A>, which is organized by a very
efficient specific team. Nevertheless it should not be the only
get-together, and we should push more for local meetings, employing
our resources for that. I see as perfectly reasonable supporting
economically the trips of active contributors when that will make
possible joining others to work on specific topics.</P><P>A simple metric for deciding when to do that and when not, beside the
required amount of money, can be the number <I>x</I> of other developers
asking for that. If and <EM>when</EM> money will become an issue, I do
not see any showstopper in organizing specific sponsoring campaigns.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">
<DIV CLASS="center"><I>I will do my best to support, with money
and other resources, contributors get-togethers.</I></DIV>
</DIV><!--TOC paragraph Derivatives-->
<H5 CLASS="paragraph"><!--SEC ANCHOR -->Derivatives</H5><!--SEC END --><P>
We are part of the FOSS ecosystem, in which patches flow both
downstream and upstream. We
<A HREF="$(HOME)/social_contract">have promised</A> to give
back to the free software community, yet sometimes we fail to do
so. Initiatives like the recent
<A HREF="http://patch-tracking.debian.net">patch tracker</A> by Sean Finney
are a way to ensure that all our changes are visible both to downstream and
upstream.</P><P>Our derived distributions (AKA <EM>derivatives</EM>) have us as theirs
upstream, and are in a similar situation. We cannot <EM>force</EM>
them to give back to us, because our promises are not necessarily
theirs, still we should:
</P><OL CLASS="enumerate"><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">
be exemplar in our giving back practices, for example by
tracking publicly our efforts in sending patches upstream;</LI><LI CLASS="li-enumerate">make as easy as possible to give back to us, for example by
participating in cross-distribution initiatives which make
maintainers know each other and share distributed VCSs.

Doing both will strengthen our give back <EM>requests</EM> to
derivatives that we should not stop posing.</P><!--TOC subsection DPL <-> project interaction-->

<A NAME="sec:presence"></A></P><P>As a DD, I have often suffered from a perceived DPL "absence".
Maybe it was just me not being pro-active enough to ping the DPL on
IRC or email and ask, but I consider it a DPL duty to communicate his
or her presence. That comes in two forms: one is to <B>lead
discussions</B> among developers, as
<A HREF="$(DEVEL)/constitution#5">prescribed in the
constitution</A>, something I have rarely seen. While we do not want
that by default (no need for a "post-in-every-thread" DPL), I will
try to be present in "hot" discussions (vague on purpose) which
concern the organization and the big picture of the project. I will
also encourage seeking the DPL opinion on specific topics, by pinging
me explicitly.</P><P>The DPL opinion can also be a reasonable first attempt to solve a
conflict; if it fails, we do have other mechanisms to settle it. In
this respect, I believe my personal qualities can be useful for the
project: I am thoughtful, listen to others, and open to be convinced
by good arguments.</P><P>More generally, managing the <B>project agenda</B> is something that
should be expected from the DPL. Managing the agenda means having a
road map of topics the project should <EM>consider</EM> with in some
time frame. The
<A HREF="http://wiki.debian.org/DiscussionsAfterLenny">DiscussionsAfterLenny</A>
page is an example of such need. The DPL should ensure the project has
similar agendas to avoid forgetting about important topics to remember
them, say, just before a release.</P><P>Management also means keeping track of what happened. The
<A HREF="http://dep.debian.net/deps/dep0/">DEP proposal</A>--started by
myself, <A HREF="http://chistera.yi.org/~adeodato/blog/">Adeodato Simó</A>,
and <A HREF="http://liw.iki.fi/liw/">Lars Wirzenius</A>--was an attempt to
deliver a device to achieve that: no excessive extra burden induced,
but a workflow to remember what is the status of "large"
project-changing proposals.</P><P>We should expect the DPL to take care of "orphaned" DEPs by
reassigning or driving them in first person. DEPs have not taken off
due to the lack of some technical bits and of representative
examples. I will ensure that we give a try to DEPs, or similar
devices, to check whether we can finally have a sane choice between
hyper-formal decisions by the mean of GRs and folklore decisions which
too often resemble no decisions at all.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">

<A NAME="sec:transparency"></A></P><P>Another way for a DPL to be present is to disclose <EM>periodically</EM>
what she or he is doing; let's call it "transparency". Recently we
have got better, but only 4 or 5 "bits from ..." mails during a
DPL term is still too little for a role which is meant to represent
such a big and diverse project.</P><P>I'm sure that a given number of DPL activities are not suitable for
disclosure, whether they are personal to some, plain boring, or
otherwise should not be archived forever on the Web. I'm also aware
that writing from scratch a "bits from DPL" mail can be time
consuming and possibly intimidating.</P><P>The solution I will implement is to have some constant <B>feed of
DPL activity news</B>. "Feed" as a concept, the implementation can
vary: an IRC channel, blogging or micro-blogging, a wiki page
<TT>BitsFromTheDPL</TT> handled <EM>à la</EM>
<A HREF="http://wiki.debian.org/DeveloperNews"><TT>DeveloperNews</TT></A>,
posts to <TT>-private</TT> for sensitive material, etc. No feed
activity will mean no DPL activity and the right for DDs to complain
and demand explanation. I believe that activities which are not yet
ready to be disclosed <EM>at all</EM>, not even by censoring or
rewording details, are scarce enough <EM>not</EM> to imply empty feeds.</P><P>The resulting feed will then be frozen each month and posted to
<TT>d-d-a</TT>. If I fail to post and freeze twice, I will admit my
failure by explaining the reasons and seeking opinions on how to
continue the term (e.g., using a poll, which can also contain an
option "resign, you do not communicate enough").</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">

unexpected absences), and help in communicating outside and inside the

ordinary, term-limited, delegation. As the DPL, I will take full
responsibility for 2IC actions.</P><DIV CLASS="mantra">

<H4 CLASS="subsubsection"><!--SEC ANCHOR --><A NAME="htoc13">2.3.3</A>  Core teams</H4><!--SEC END --><P>
<A NAME="sec:core-teams"></A></P><P>Our core teams have recently improved a lot, in terms of manpower and
communication. Kudos for that go to Steve McIntyre and Sam Hocevar
(the last two DPLs) and of course to the team themselves.
Nevertheless some teams are still short, or so it seems from the
outside. Adding members makes a team more tolerant to absences, and
also helps to prepare the next generation of contributors. The
distinction between assistants and regulars in several teams seems to
work very well in that respect.</P><P>My naive intention would be to bring all core teams to at least three
members and to push for campaigning for assistants when there are no
well-established procedures for team joining. Also, by looking at our
<A HREF="$(INTRO)/organization">organization page</A> it
looks as if several teams are either not active anymore, or are very
bad in communicating what they are doing. For their own good, involved
people should be encouraged to replacement and something to work on
that is more fun for them.</P><P>All these changes however should be attempted first with team
agreement, to not bother potentially understaffed yet very efficient
teams. I will start from the precious
<A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/04/msg00014.html">team
reviews</A> gathered by Steve McIntyre last year<SUP><A NAME="text2" HREF="#note2">2</A></SUP> to drive re-staffing and procedural changes
in order not to bother properly working teams.</P><!--TOC section Additional info-->

<A NAME="sec:time-commit"></A></P><P>Being DPL is challenging ; for it to succeed the job must be taken
seriously. For the duration of the mandate I will therefore put on
hold my other Debian tasks; it is an obligation towards habitual
co-workers and a fair deal to avoid burning out. I'm not the only
responsible person in most of my current Debian duties and I will leave
behind efficient teams, so I'm confident the tasks will not remain
unattended. The remaining parts are a handful of packages which will
need new maintainers.</P><P>On the same topic and for the sake of clarity: some DPL candidates
have in the past declared their ability to act as DPL full-time. I
cannot grant that. What I offer is my Debian time, to be diverted to
DPL tasks. Luckily though, I work at a university where I have a very
FOSS-sensitive boss. I have the freedom to reorganize and possibly
shrink my schedule both for emergencies, and for longer activities
such as traveling to deliver Debian talks. Like most of us, I'm
generally available on IRC, phone, etc.</P><!--TOC subsection Live platform-->

<A NAME="sec:live-platform"></A></P><P>Beside rebuttals, the DPL platform is fixed once and for all at the
end of the nomination period. While that makes perfect sense in the
context of a vote, it makes it hard for candidates to communicate
their positions on important topics, because of the volume of
information the vote process generates. Hence, if noteworthy topics
will come up during the campaigning, I will summarize my positions
about them at
<A HREF="http://www.upsilon.cc/~zack/hacking/debian/dpl-2009/"><TT>http://www.upsilon.cc/~zack/hacking/debian/dpl-2009/</TT></A>.</P>

<A NAME="sec:Rebuttal"></A></P><P>
I have known Steve and Luk for quite a while now and I deeply respect
what they both did for Debian in all these years. I acknowledge all
the problems they (yup, "they", because they are de facto running in
tandem) mention in their platform: communication, humbleness and
asking for help, ... In fact most of them are general problems of all
free software projects.
<P>
That notwithstanding, their platform lacks hints and strategies that
explain <I>how</I> they are going to attack those problems: it is not
enough to say, e.g., "I want to see improvements made where they are
clearly needed" to actually deploy the improvements. Also, I'm missing
the vision of the two candidates on relevant topics such as Debian
membership, mailing list discussion quality, derivatives, ...
<P>
All in all I found that the main contribution to the decision of
voting for Steve and Luk is the example set by Steve in the current
DPL term. The platform, which is what a rebuttal is meant to comment
upon, does not have much more to offer.
<p>
I acknowledge that Steve did some great work during the current DPL
term, but most of his practical tasks are approaching completion. It
would have been great to know what, if elected, he plans to work on
<I>additionally</I>. Presenting such a "diff" is, in my opinion, the duty
of the DPL currently in charge, when standing for re-election.
