               In the graph above, any pink colored nodes imply that
               the option did not pass majority, the Blue is the
               winner. The Octagon is used for the options that did
               not beat the default.

               In the following table, tally[row x][col y] represents

               Debian uses the Condorcet method voting.
               Simplistically, plain Condorcets method
               can be stated like so : <br/>
               <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
                  The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
                  candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
                  race with that candidate.</q>
               The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
               be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
               and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
               various means of resolving the tie. See
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
               for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
               <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
               specifically,  A.6.
