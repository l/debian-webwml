<H1 class="title">Debian Voting Information</H1>

		<P>The Debian Project has a vote tracking system which gives status of
		ongoing General Resolutions and the results of previous votes.</P>
		
		<P>The status of ongoing General Resolutions include the proposal and
		list of seconds, all important dates and the necessary rules for
		passage.  Of course, the status will also include one of the following:
		</P>
		<UL>
		<LI>Proposal - Waiting for seconds.
		<LI>Discussion - In minimum two week discussion period.
		<LI>Voting - Voting process taking place.
		<LI>Closed - Voting is over.
		</UL>
		
		<P>The results of previous votes (closed resolutions) include the
		outcome as well as a list of all people who voted and what their vote
		was. It also has available the text of each vote sent.</P>

		<P>The Standard Resolution Procedure, which involves voting, is 
		described in appendix A of the 
		<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">Debian
		Constitution</A>. For more information how to read the beat matrix,
		which is published as the outcome of votes, you may look at this
