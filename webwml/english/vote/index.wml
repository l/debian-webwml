    <h1 class="title">Debian Voting Information</h1>

    <p>
       The Debian Project has a vote tracking system
       (DEbian VoTe EnginE [devotee]) which gives status of
       ongoing General Resolutions and the results of
       previous votes.
    </p>

    <p>
       The status of ongoing General Resolutions include the proposal and
       list of seconds, all important dates and the necessary rules for
       passage.  Of course, the status will also include one of the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
       <li>Proposal - Waiting for seconds.</li>
       <li>Discussion - In minimum two week discussion period.</li>
       <li>Voting - Voting process taking place.</li>
       <li>Closed - Voting is over.</li>
    </UL>

    <p>
      The results of previous votes (closed resolutions) include the
      outcome as well as a list of all people who voted and what their
      vote was. It also has available the text of each vote sent,
      unless it was a secret ballot..
    </p>

     <p>
      Debian uses the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condorcet_method">Condorcet
        method</a> for project leader
      elections (the wikipedia article linked to is pretty informative).
      Simplistically, plain Condorcet's method can be stated like so : <br/>
      <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
         The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
         candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
         race with that candidate.</q>
       The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
       be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
       and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
       various means of resolving the tie. See
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
       for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
       <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
       specifically, § A.6.

      which is published as the outcome of votes, you may look at this
