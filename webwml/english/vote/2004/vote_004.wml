	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 As a seconder of the <a href="vote_003">earlier
                 GR</a>, I certainly do consider these <a
                 href="social_contract_reform.3">amendments</a> to be
                 editorial in nature, as they are consistent with my
                 understanding of the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">existing Social
                 Contract</a> and I believe these clarifications are
                 beneficial in the long term, because the ambiguities
                 in the Social Contract led mostly to sterile
                 arguments about whether the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> <strong>should</strong>
                 apply to works we distribute that are not programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                 It's just the timing that sucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In talking with the Release Manager, it is apparent
		    to me that his understanding of the
                  <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">previous wording</a>
                 of the Social Contract, while different from mine, is
                 internally consistent; and that attempting to
                 persuade him that a different interpretation should
                 have held would do nothing to move the release
                 forward, as I cannot in good conscience argue that he
                 should be less principled in the enforcement of the
                 <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>
                 than he has been to date.  I am therefore putting
                 forth this proposal because my *own* principles hold
                 that releasing sarge this year with the same
                 blemishes that have existed since the beginning is
                 better than releasing a sarge next year that has no
                 non-<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> content.
              </p>
              <p>
                 A fixed four month period should (based on current
                 projections) give us ample time to release sarge,
                 while not allowing so much time that maintainers are
                 left to think that resolving the status of
                 non-program components of Debian vis à vis the DFSG
                 is not an imminent concern.

                  </li>
	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 While a four month period should be enough time to
                 release sarge, without this amendment, we leave open
                 the possibility that we do not release in time and
                 must repeat this process again. I think it's best to
                 declare explicitly how long this exception should
                 remain in effect rather than assume that we have
                 picked a big enough window. Although on the downside,
                 it relieves some pressure to release sarge soon, but
                 it also prevents us from rushing to release by
                 September 1 which may result in an inferior product.
              </p>
              <p>
                 I really hope that this amendment is not needed
                 (i.e. we release by September 1 anyways), but I think
                 we should allow for the worst, just in case.

                  that the paragraph added to the Social Contract by this Resolution

	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <h3>Rationale</h3>
	    <p>
	      I largely concur with Steve's rationale above. However,
	      having amended the Social Contract already in a way that
	      many of our developers feel best expresses their
	      principles yet being quite some distance away from being
	      able to meet those standards, I feel that the most
	      honest approach is to note in the Social Contract itself
	      that we apologize for not living up to those principles
	      just yet. We can then get on with releasing something
	      that's the best we can do in the time we need to satisfy
	      those of our userbase who are frustrated with the age of
	      the previous release, and start removing or rewriting
	      whatever's necessary after that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As well as being, in my opinion, more honest, amending
	      the Social Contract rather than resolving to ignore it
	      means that the Release Manager will no longer be in the
	      position of either having to violate the Social Contract
	      or else having to postpone a full Debian release for an
	      as yet indeterminate period of time. (This also applies
	      to Steve's original proposal.)
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Social Contract as amended here does not require the
	      removal of non-free documentation or kernel drivers with
	      binary-only firmware from sarge or its point releases;
	      but it restores the full force of version 1.1 with
	      effect from sarge+1. It does not excuse any other DFSG
	      violations in sarge. I feel that we already have plenty
	      of incentive to release sarge in a short timeframe, and
	      that we're well on the way to doing so.

               I propose we adopt a foundation document that tries to

               required whenever a change occurs in a foundation

			   Transition Guide<br>
 A working guide to achieve the transition for changes in Foundation documents<br>

             </p>
             <p>
                In GR 2004_003, the wording of the social contract was
                modified. The sociial contract represents the core of
                what the project is, and the implications of the
                Social Contract leave their mark in many ways, deeply
                intertwined with the components of the
                distribution. Any change in the social contract has
                major ramifications, and may require a period of work
                and potentially deep rooted changes before we can come
                into compliance with the contract.
             </p>

             <p>
                  Meeting out commitments to the Social Contract is an
                  on going process. Since we have recently changed
                  these commitments, we need an interval of time
                  before we can approach compliance.  Unless we shut
                  down the project completely, leaving our users in
                  the lurch, the day to day activities of the project
                  have to continue while we are working towards
                  compliance.
             </p>

             <p>
                  There is precedence for this gap in ratifying a
                  foundation and implementing the dictats of that
                  document; as Joey Hess reminded me: when we first
                  accepted the Social Contract and the DFSG, there was
                  an interval before we came into compliance (indeed,
                  it is arguable if we were ever completely in
                  compliance -- see above about it being an on going
                  process). Indeed, there was a release of a minor
                  version just days after the DFSG was accepted, which
                  by no means complied.
             </p>

             <p>
                  We also did not yank out older releases, or drop
                  support for them immediately (as shown by the minor
                  release).
             </p>

             <p>
                  The binding principle here is that we have to
                  balance the needs of our users and the need to make
                  Debian strictly free. As seen on the mailing lists:

             <blockquote>
               <p>
                  In my opinion, the needs of the free software
                  community take precedence in the context of adopting
                  new packages, in the setting of release goals, in
                  our choices about infrastructure and philosophy, and
                  of course in the context of any development work we
                  do.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In my opinion, the needs of our users take
                  precedence in the context of security fixes, in the
                  context of support for packages and systems we've
                  released, and in the context of the quality of our
                  work.

              <p>
                  With this document, we, the Debian Project, do so
                  affirm this. We affirm that while we are working
                  towards a change in the long term goals and identity
                  of the project, or any change in a foundation
                  document, the needs of the users shall not be
                  catered to during the transition period.
              </p>
              <p>
                   We affirm that whenever a change in the Social
                   Contract takes place, the activities required to
                   provide ongoing and proactive support for versions
                   of Debian that have already been released shall
                   continue in the period where we are working towards
                   compliance. This includes, but is not necessarily
                   limited to, providing security updates, bug fixes,
                   preparing for the release of the next (compliant)
                   release, adopting new packages, and making point
                   releases to refresh already released versions of
                   Debian.
              </p>
              <p>
		In the specific case of the GR 2004_003, since that
		current release, code named "Sarge", is very close to
		release, and the previously released version is quite
		out of date, our commitment to our users dictates that
		the "Sarge" release should go on as planned, even
		while we are trying to reach compliance with the
		Social Contract. This exemption for "Sarge" applies to
		security releases, and point releases as well.
              </p>
             </div>
	    <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                   My intent was not just to find a way for us to
                   allow to release Sarge, it was to create a
                   guideline to help ease us through major changes in
                   something like the Social contract, or the
                   constitution.  The fact that a generic transition
                   guide may help us also release Sarge soon is a nice
                   side effect.
              </p>
              <p>
	        It has been suggested that transitioning ought to be
	        handled in the original proposal itself, and yes, that
	        is a good idea. But foresight is weak, compared to
	        8/20 hind sight, and there may be unforeseen
	        consequences of a proposed change that were not
	        evident while drafting the proposal.
              </p>
              <p>
      	        Nothing is perfect. I would much rather we also had a
      	        process defined to pick up the pieces if the
      	        before-the-fact transition plan blew up in our face;
      	        this is way better than relying on perfect foresight
      	        in transition plans.
              </p>
              <p>
	       The other issue addressed in the proposal is one of
	       choosing between two different requirements of the
	       social contract; and how to balance these different
	       requirements when some of these requirements are
	       changed.
