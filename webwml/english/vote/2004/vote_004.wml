	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 As a seconder of the <a href="vote_003">earlier
                 GR</a>, I certainly do consider these <a
                 href="social_contract_reform.3">amendments</a> to be
                 editorial in nature, as they are consistent with my
                 understanding of the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">existing Social
                 Contract</a> and I believe these clarifications are
                 beneficial in the long term, because the ambiguities
                 in the Social Contract led mostly to sterile
                 arguments about whether the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> <strong>should</strong>
                 apply to works we distribute that are not programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                 It's just the timing that sucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In talking with the Release Manager, it is apparent
		    to me that his understanding of the
                  <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">previous wording</a>
                 of the Social Contract, while different from mine, is
                 internally consistent; and that attempting to
                 persuade him that a different interpretation should
                 have held would do nothing to move the release
                 forward, as I cannot in good conscience argue that he
                 should be less principled in the enforcement of the
                 <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>
                 than he has been to date.  I am therefore putting
                 forth this proposal because my *own* principles hold
                 that releasing sarge this year with the same
                 blemishes that have existed since the beginning is
                 better than releasing a sarge next year that has no
                 non-<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> content.
              </p>
              <p>
                 A fixed four month period should (based on current
                 projections) give us ample time to release sarge,
                 while not allowing so much time that maintainers are
                 left to think that resolving the status of
                 non-program components of Debian vis à vis the DFSG
                 is not an imminent concern.

	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 While a four month period should be enough time to
                 release sarge, without this amendment, we leave open
                 the possibility that we do not release in time and
                 must repeat this process again. I think it's best to
                 declare explicitly how long this exception should
                 remain in effect rather than assume that we have
                 picked a big enough window. Although on the downside,
                 it relieves some pressure to release sarge soon, but
                 it also prevents us from rushing to release by
                 September 1 which may result in an inferior product.
              </p>
              <p>
                 I really hope that this amendment is not needed
                 (i.e. we release by September 1 anyways), but I think
                 we should allow for the worst, just in case.

                  that the paragraph added to the Social Contract by this Resolution

                  for deliberation.
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <h3>Rationale</h3>
	    <p>
	      I largely concur with Steve's rationale above. However,
	      having amended the Social Contract already in a way that
	      many of our developers feel best expresses their
	      principles yet being quite some distance away from being
	      able to meet those standards, I feel that the most
	      honest approach is to note in the Social Contract itself
	      that we apologize for not living up to those principles
	      just yet. We can then get on with releasing something
	      that's the best we can do in the time we need to satisfy
	      those of our userbase who are frustrated with the age of
	      the previous release, and start removing or rewriting
	      whatever's necessary after that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As well as being, in my opinion, more honest, amending
	      the Social Contract rather than resolving to ignore it
	      means that the Release Manager will no longer be in the
	      position of either having to violate the Social Contract
	      or else having to postpone a full Debian release for an
	      as yet indeterminate period of time. (This also applies
	      to Steve's original proposal.)
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Social Contract as amended here does not require the
	      removal of non-free documentation or kernel drivers with
	      binary-only firmware from sarge or its point releases;
	      but it restores the full force of version 1.1 with
	      effect from sarge+1. It does not excuse any other DFSG
	      violations in sarge. I feel that we already have plenty
	      of incentive to release sarge in a short timeframe, and
	      that we're well on the way to doing so.
	    </p>
