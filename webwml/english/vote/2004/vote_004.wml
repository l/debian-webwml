 <strong>The Debian Project,</strong><br>
	    <p>
                affirming its committment to principles of freeness
                for all works it distributes,
	    </p>
	    <p>
                but recognizing that changing the Social Contract
                today would have grave consequences for the upcoming
                stable release, a fact which does not serve our
                goals or the interests of our users,
	    </p>
	    <p>
                hereby resolves:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	  	<li>
                     that the amendments to the Social Contract
                     contained within the General Resolution
                     <q>Editorial Amendments To The Social Contract</q>
                     (2004 vote 003) be immediately rescinded;
                  </li>
	  	<li>
                     that these amendments, which have already been
                     ratified by the Debian Project, will be
                     reinstated effective as of September 1, 2004
                     without further cause for deliberation.
                  </li>
	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 As a seconder of the earlier GR, I certainly do
                 consider these amendments to be editorial in nature,
                 as they are consistent with my understanding of the
                 existing Social Contract; and I believe these
                 clarifications are beneficial in the long term,
                 because the ambiguities in the Social Contract led
                 mostly to sterile arguments about whether the DFSG
                 *should* apply to works we distribute that are not
                 programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                 It's just the timing that sucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In talking with the Release Manager, it is apparent
                 to me that his understanding of the previous wording
                 of the Social Contract, while different from mine, is
                 internally consistent; and that attempting to
                 persuade him that a different interpretation should
                 have held would do nothing to move the release
                 forward, as I cannot in good conscience argue that he
                 should be less principled in the enforcement of the
                 Social Contract than he has been to date.  I am
                 therefore putting forth this proposal because my *own*
                 principles hold that releasing sarge this year with
                 the same blemishes that have existed since the
                 beginning is better than releasing a sarge next year
                 that has no non-DFSG content.
              </p>
              <p>
                 A fixed four month period should (based on current
                 projections) give us ample time to release sarge,
                 while not allowing so much time that maintainers are
                 left to think that resolving the status of
                 non-program components of Debian vis à vis the DFSG
                 is not an imminent concern.
              </p>
              <p>
              <em>Since this modifies the Social Contract, this requires a 3:1 
                  majority to pass.</em></p>
