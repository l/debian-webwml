              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 As a seconder of the <a href="vote_003">earlier
                 GR</a>, I certainly do consider these <a
                 href="social_contract_reform.3">amendments</a> to be
                 editorial in nature, as they are consistent with my
                 understanding of the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">existing Social
                 Contract</a> and I believe these clarifications are
                 beneficial in the long term, because the ambiguities
                 in the Social Contract led mostly to sterile
                 arguments about whether the <a
                 href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> <strong>should</strong>
                 apply to works we distribute that are not programs.
              </p>
              <p>
                 It's just the timing that sucks.
              </p>
              <p>
                 In talking with the Release Manager, it is apparent
		    to me that his understanding of the
                  <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract.1.0">previous wording</a>
                 of the Social Contract, while different from mine, is
                 internally consistent; and that attempting to
                 persuade him that a different interpretation should
                 have held would do nothing to move the release
                 forward, as I cannot in good conscience argue that he
                 should be less principled in the enforcement of the
                 <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>
                 than he has been to date.  I am therefore putting
                 forth this proposal because my *own* principles hold
                 that releasing sarge this year with the same
                 blemishes that have existed since the beginning is
                 better than releasing a sarge next year that has no
                 non-<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#DFSG">DFSG</a> content.
              </p>
              <p>
                 A fixed four month period should (based on current
                 projections) give us ample time to release sarge,
                 while not allowing so much time that maintainers are
                 left to think that resolving the status of
                 non-program components of Debian vis à vis the DFSG
                 is not an imminent concern.

              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                 While a four month period should be enough time to
                 release sarge, without this amendment, we leave open
                 the possibility that we do not release in time and
                 must repeat this process again. I think it's best to
                 declare explicitly how long this exception should
                 remain in effect rather than assume that we have
                 picked a big enough window. Although on the downside,
                 it relieves some pressure to release sarge soon, but
                 it also prevents us from rushing to release by
                 September 1 which may result in an inferior product.
              </p>
              <p>
                 I really hope that this amendment is not needed
                 (i.e. we release by September 1 anyways), but I think
                 we should allow for the worst, just in case.

                  that the paragraph added to the Social Contract by this Resolution
                  shall be removed from the Social Contract upon the next full release
                  of Debian after Debian 3.1 (codenamed sarge), without further cause
                  for deliberation.
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <h3>Rationale</h3>
	    <p>
	      I largely concur with Steve's rationale above. However,
	      having amended the Social Contract already in a way that
	      many of our developers feel best expresses their
	      principles yet being quite some distance away from being
	      able to meet those standards, I feel that the most
	      honest approach is to note in the Social Contract itself
	      that we apologize for not living up to those principles
	      just yet. We can then get on with releasing something
	      that's the best we can do in the time we need to satisfy
	      those of our userbase who are frustrated with the age of
	      the previous release, and start removing or rewriting
	      whatever's necessary after that.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      As well as being, in my opinion, more honest, amending
	      the Social Contract rather than resolving to ignore it
	      means that the Release Manager will no longer be in the
	      position of either having to violate the Social Contract
	      or else having to postpone a full Debian release for an
	      as yet indeterminate period of time. (This also applies
	      to Steve's original proposal.)
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Social Contract as amended here does not require the
	      removal of non-free documentation or kernel drivers with
	      binary-only firmware from sarge or its point releases;
	      but it restores the full force of version 1.1 with
	      effect from sarge+1. It does not excuse any other DFSG
	      violations in sarge. I feel that we already have plenty
	      of incentive to release sarge in a short timeframe, and
	      that we're well on the way to doing so.

 A working guide to achieve the transition for changes in Foundation documents<br>

             </p>
             <p>
                The Social Contract represents the core commitments of
                the Project. The Social Contract leaves its marks in
                many ways; it is deeply intertwined with all parts of
                the Project. Potentially, any change to the Social
                Contract has major ramifications, and may require a
                period of potentially deep changes to the roots of the
                Project before it can come into compliance with the
                changed Contract.
             </p>

             <p>
                  Meeting our commitments as described in the Social
                  Contact is an ongoing process. Whenever we change
                  these commitments, we may need an interval of time
                  before we can approach compliance. Unless we shut
                  down the Project completely - abandoning users and
                  our developers - the regular activities of the
                  Project must continue while we work towards
                  compliance.
             </p>

             <p>
                  There is precedent for a gap between ratifying a
                  change to the foundation documents of the Project
                  and implementing dictates of that document; when the
                  Project first accepted the Social Contract and the
                  Debian Free Software Guidelines, there was an
                  interval before we came into compliance with those
                  then-new documents. Indeed, a minor version was
                  released just days after the Debian Free Software
                  Guidelines were accepted, and this release by no
                  means complied with the new commitments.
             </p>

             <p>
                  We also continued to support older non-complying
                  releases, and did not make them unavailable to our
                  users.
             </p>

             <p>
                  The binding principle here is that we have to
                  balance the needs of our users and the need to make
                  Debian strictly free. As one developer has said:
             </p>
             <blockquote>
               <p>
                  In my opinion, the needs of the free software
                  community take precedence in the context of adopting
                  new packages, in the setting of release goals, in
                  our choices about infrastructure and philosophy, and
                  of course in the context of any development work we
                  do.
               </p>
               <p>
                  In my opinion, the needs of our users take
                  precedence in the context of security fixes, in the
                  context of support for packages and systems we've
                  released, and in the context of the quality of our
                  work.
               </p>
             </blockquote>
              <p>
                  We, the Debian Project, do so affirm this
                  judgmen. While we are working towards complying with
                  a change in the goals or identity of the Project, or
                  towards compliance with any change to a foundation
                  document, the needs of our users will be catered
                  to. This may mean that for a limited time, Debian
                  will not be compliant with the new Social Contract.
              </p>
              <p>
                   Whenever a change to our foundation documents takes
                   place, the activities required to provide ongoing
                   and proactive support for the Debian user community
                   shall continue. This includes, but is not
                   necessarily limited to, providing security updates
                   for previously-released versions of Debian,
                   providing point-release updates to
                   previously-released versions of Debian, preparing
                   for the next (compliant) release of Debian,
                   actually releasing the current non-compliant
                   version of Debian if such a release is imminent (as
                   well as any further updates to that version of
                   Debian), and providing all the Project's
                   infrastructure such as bug-tracking and mailing
                   lists.
              </p>
              <p>
		In the specific case of General Resolution 2004_003,
		since that release currently in preparation, code
		named "Sarge", is very close to release, and the
		previously released version is quite out of date, our
		commitment to our users dictates that the "Sarge"
		release should go on as planned - even while we are in
		the process of reaching compliance with the new Social
		Contract. This exemption for "Sarge" applies to
		security releases and point releases as well.
              </p>
             </div>
	    <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                   My intent was not just to find a way for us to
                   allow to release Sarge, it was to create a
                   guideline to help ease us through major changes in
                   something like the Social contract, or the
                   constitution.  The fact that a generic transition
                   guide may help us also release Sarge soon is a nice
                   side effect.
              </p>
              <p>
	        It has been suggested that transitioning ought to be
	        handled in the original proposal itself, and yes, that
	        is a good idea. But foresight is weak, compared to
	        8/20 hind sight, and there may be unforeseen
	        consequences of a proposed change that were not
	        evident while drafting the proposal.
              </p>
              <p>
      	        Nothing is perfect. I would much rather we also had a
      	        process defined to pick up the pieces if the
      	        before-the-fact transition plan blew up in our face;
      	        this is way better than relying on perfect foresight
      	        in transition plans.
              </p>
              <p>
	       The other issue addressed in the proposal is one of
	       choosing between two different requirements of the
	       social contract; and how to balance these different
	       requirements when some of these requirements are
	       changed.
