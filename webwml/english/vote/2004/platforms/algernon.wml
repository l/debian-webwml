    <h1 class="title">Platform for Gergely Nagy</h1>
    <h2>Background</h2>

    <p>My name is Gergely Nagy, and I do hope I will finish way after
    the other candidates, even after None of the Above. I am 22 years
    old, was born a year before Susan Calvin, as a male (so I have no
    chance of becoming a famous robopsychologist this way).</p>

    <p>Now, back to my point, if I have one, which I don't, except at
    the end of each sentence.</p>

    <p>Anyways, I have been a Debian maintainer since late 2000,
    served as an Application Manager for a short while, then gone back
    to maintain my packages (currently tama, sam, ed, thy and a few
    others, like dpatch for which I'm a co-maintainer, but I'm the one
    to blame for the 2.0 rewrite. Except dpatch-edit-patch, that one
    is David's fault!).</p>

    <p>Apart from these, I have my dirty fingerprints spread over a
    lot of packages I submitted patches for.</p>

    <p>However, all of these doesn't matter, as you will not vote for
    me.</p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>

    <p>I can summarise my goals in quite a few ways. Read on, dear
    reader!</p>

    <h3>The Day Of The Tentacle Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Step one: <strong>Find plans</strong></li>
      <li> Step two: <strong>Save world</strong></li>
      <li> Step three: <strong>GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Be Nice To Users Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Step one: <strong>Kick all morons</strong></li>
      <li> Step two: <strong>Kick everyone who is nasty to poor
      users</strong></li>
      <li> Step three: <strong>Hide from Marillat</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Profit Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Step one: <strong>Sue everyone for no apparent
      reason</strong> (if it works for SCO, it should work for us
      too!!!)</li>
      <li> Step two: <strong>???</strong></li>
      <li> Step three: <strong>Make Profit!</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Slayers Summary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> Step one: <strong>Eat something</strong> (...and then, eat
      more... and maybe a little more.... just one more cake! ...just
      that chicken on your plate...)</li>
      <li> Step two: <strong>Beat bad guys</strong> (who didn't let me
      finish eating. THERE YOU HAVE YOUR DRAGON SLAVE! And if that
      didn't work, you'll have a GIGA SLAVE too :P)</li>
      <li> Step three: <strong>Take gold.</strong> (Or anything that is
      still in one piece.)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Only problem being, I'm a male, so I can't be Lina
    Inverse...</p>

    <h3>The Threepwood Summary</h3>

    <p><strong>LOOK BEHIND YOU! A THREE-HEADED MONKEY!</strong></p>

    <h2>Why you should vote for me</h2>

    <strong>You must not!</strong>

    <h3>What others want me to say you should vote for me</h3>

    <p>Some of my friends say that there hasn't been any hungarian
    project leader yet, so this is a good time to change that! Thank
    all the hard working hungarians like Ingo Molnar (of lkml fame) by
    voting for a fellow hungarian (who even met Ingo once, hey!).</p>

    <p>I'm sexy. <small>(Okay, okay, I admit it, I said that, and it
    is not true. At least I'm honest now!)</small></p>

    <p>I have a tamagotchi. Every year, I tried to ask the candidates
    during the debate whether they have a tamagotchi. As far as I
    recall, they didn't. I do, and he is fat and old and will sit on
    anyone who votes for me.</p>

    <h2>Why you should not vote for me</h2>

    <p>I asked you not to.</p>

    <p>If I win, I will resign immediately, or disappear for good, so
    do not even think about voting for me.</p>

    <p>In case I do not do any of the above mentioned evilnesses, I
    will NMU policy, forbidding usernames starting with capital
    letters and having a dash in them, for they are annoying.</p>

    <p>I am a fortunate man (if for no other reason, I have a
    girlfriend beside me), and as the saying goes, behind every
    fortunate man, there stands a brilliant woman. Now, I do not want
    this leader thing to take time away from us. Then, when there is a
    brilliant woman behind me, why the hell would you vote for me, who
    demonstratably has no clue at all?</p>

    <p>I want to get rid of Perl from the base system. Not that I
    don't like it, but I prefer shoop. Everything that is written in
    Perl in our base system, should be rewritten in shoop instead.</p>

    <p>On fridays, you should all wear pink skirts and dance on the
    streets praising my name.</p>

    <p>Everyone entering the New Maintainer queue should be taught to
    program in whitespace.</p>

    <p>My girlfriend says that if you vote for me, you will be
    cursed. Believe me, you do not want that. It means constant
    black-out or random power failures for an extended period of
    time.</p>

    <p>If being a member of Front Desk counts as being part of the
    Cabal, then I was once member of the Cabal. Shoot me.</p>

    <h2>Conclusions</h2>

    <p>I suck. This is a fun nomination, so that Martin can have a
    good laugh (and hopefully everyone else too, except Marillat from
    whom I need to hide).</p>

    <p>Thank you very much, for reading this long. I'm looking forward
    to giving nonsensical answers to otherwise fine questions during
    the debate!</p>
