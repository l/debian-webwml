    <h1 class="title">Platform for Martin Michlmayr</h1>

<H2>Background</H2>

<p>My name is Martin Michlmayr, and I hope that you will re-elect me as your
Debian Project Leader.  I believe I have successfully shown that I can
lead, coordinate, and motivate Debian.  I would like to continue serving
the community and I want to lead Debian to continued success.</p>

<p>
I hold Master degrees in Philosophy, Psychology and Software Engineering
from the University of Innsbruck and the University of Melbourne.  In
January, I started a PhD at the University of Cambridge and I'm a member of
the <a href = "http://www.cyrius.com/milchi/kings/">beautiful King's
College</a>.  My research focuses on quality management in free software
projects.  Since this work partly overlaps with my involvement in Debian,
it will allow me to devote time to Debian and to attend conferences.  With
this and my spare time, I intend to work (more than) full-time on
Debian&nbsp;&mdash; just like I did last year.
</p>

<p>
I have been involved in various free software projects for about 10 years.
I truly believe in the philosophy of free software, and feel honoured to be
a member of this community.  I joined Debian because I fully share its
vision, and because I saw the project as an interesting
challenge&nbsp;&mdash; the main role I played in all the projects I have
been involved in centered around coordination, and Debian requires a high
amount of coordination and leadership due to its size and complexity.
While I contribute to Debian in various areas, coordination and leadership
are those areas where I have the most significant impact.
</p>

<h3>My Involvement in Debian</h3>

<p>
I contribute to Debian in three main areas.  First, I am involved in the <a
href = "http://nm.debian.org/">New Maintainer (NM)</a> process.  When I
joined Debian, shortly after New Maintainer was re-opened, I had a desire
to decrease the long queue of applicants and prospective contributors.  As
an Application Manager (AM), I processed a large number of applicants, and
helped to decrease the waiting time for NM significantly.  I later got
involved in the NM Front Desk, and I have coordinated the New Maintainer
process for over 3 years now.  I assign Application Managers to new
applicants, offer advice to applicants and AMs, read every single AM report
and provide feedback, and work with the Debian Account Manager (DAM) to
ensure the smooth operation of the New Maintainer process.
</p>

<p>
Second, I perform various <a href = "http://qa.debian.org/">Quality
Assurance (QA)</a> tasks.  Unfortunately, QA is an area which has been
neglected in Debian in the past.  Together with others, I helped introduce
more QA efforts in Debian by coordinating and organizing various QA
activities, such as Bug Squashing Parties.  In particular, I introduced
systematic tracking of inactive maintainers.  I have approached more than
150 maintainers who appeared inactive, and (cautiously) orphaned more than
300 packages over the years.  While I'm still involved in QA, in particular
by dealing with inactive maintainers and handling removed packages, I am
glad to see that more people have recently become interested.  I believe
that we will be able to build a strong QA team in the next few months which
performs more systematic QA than in the past.  QA is also tightly connected
to the research I carry out as part of my PhD in Cambridge, and I hope that
my research will lead to higher quality in Debian and other free software
projects.
</p>

<p>
Third, I am involved in many coordination tasks within the project.  Even
before becoming <a href = "http://www.debian.org/devel/leader">Debian
Project Leader</a>, I carried out various coordination tasks, helping other
developers perform their work more efficiently and making sure that certain
tasks are not forgotten.  As Debian Project Leader, I represent the project
to the outside world, but also perform a lot of coordination and leadership
inside the project to ensure that everything keeps running smoothly.  Due
to the size and complexity of Debian, there are many coordination tasks
which have to be carried out on a constant basis.  It is important to stay
in close contact with a large number of developers, to find out how you can
make their life easier and to assist their work.  In some cases,
productivity can be significantly increased by small means, for example by
supplying porting hardware, by giving special access to facilities or by
putting people in contact with others.  This work requires knowledge about
a wide range of aspects in the project, such as an understanding of how
important infrastructure works and a personal familiarity with the people
carrying out development tasks.  It is vital to connect various bits of
information from many different sources, to see the big picture, and to
communicate it to others.
</p>

<h3>My Skills and Personality</h3>

<p>
As you can see from this overview, as well as from the introduction in my
<a href = "http://www.debian.org/vote/2003/platforms/tbm">platform from
last year</a> or from <a href = "http://www.cyrius.com/cv/cv.pdf">my
resume</a>, the main tasks I carry out are centered around coordination (or
<i>management</i>, in pointy-hair speech).  I am running for Debian Project
Leader because I believe that I am a good leader and a good coordinator.
Coordinating a project the size of Debian requires a very different set of
skills than maintaining a large package, such as glibc.  While I maintain
packages and write code, my true skills lie in coordination and management.
I would like to continue contributing to Debian the best way I can: by
leading and coordinating the project, thereby making sure that the project
runs smoothly.
</p>

As argued before, coordination requires a large range of information.  In
order to coordinate a project like Debian you have to keep track of what is
going on and what remains to be done.  
Furthermore, leading a team of a thousand developers requires constant
interaction with developers, users and others.  The Debian Project Leader
is the main contact person for the project, and it is important that
interaction is easy and painless.  Over the years, I have demonstrated that
it is very easy to converse with me.  I think people perceive me as
approachable, which is a key requirement for a project leader.  When people
meet me in person, they are probably surprised that I am not the typically
extroverted and outgoing leader who often controls the discussion.  I am
more laid back, I listen to what people say.  I am very perceptive, and
this is important because I have to listen and find out about the needs of
developers and users and about problems in the project.  However, I also
know when it is time to act, to take position and lead.
</p>

<p>
Management in free software projects is a very delicate task because we
don't like traditional, top-down management.  At the same time, it is
important to carry out coordination in any project, especially in large
projects such as Debian.  There is a certain conflict which can only be
resolved through a good understanding of the style of coordination
applicable to free software projects.  Through my experience in various
projects and my skills and personality, I can successfully coordinate a
project which is compatible with the way our community works.  I am fully a
part of this community and understand the needs of the members of Debian.
Through my extensive travels, I have met a large number of Debian
developers in real life.  I meet people, get to know them and find out what
they are like.  This allows me to approach and interact with them more
easily.  At the same time, everyone who has met me knows that I am on the
same level as them&nbsp;&mdash; I'm just one part of this amazing group,
and I will always listen and be there for everyone.  My primary
contribution to Debian is to coordinate, to interact with others, to listen
and to lead.  Through these actions, I do my best to make sure that we
reach our goals and that we, as a community, have a clear vision.
</p>

<h2>My goals</h2>

<p>
The Debian Project Leader has to fulfil many different kinds of tasks.  On
a very general level, they can be divided into internal functions
(coordination, motivation, leadership) and external functions (representing
the project, working with companies and other organizations).  I believe
that it is important to have a good balance between these functions, but I
feel that we have to put some extra emphasis on the internal functions in
the coming term.  I think there are some crucial challenges we have to
address and I'll summarize them below.  The four points I will describe in
more detail are only some of the tasks I wish to carry out.  There is an
amazing amount of day-to-day work which needs attention in order to keep
the project running smoothly.  Furthermore, just like this past term, I
will again represent Debian at various conferences and events.  In the last
few months, I have given 12 talks about Debian and I have agreed to speak
at some more conferences already.  In summary, the points listed below are
areas I'd like to give special attention to, but I certainly won't limit
myself to those four areas.
</p>

<h3>Internal - our Release</h3>

<p>
As long as I can remember, there have been discussions about our release
cycles, but lately the level of frustration has been increasing.  The
Release Manager once argued that it is important to have predictable
releases, but we are far away from this goal.  At the moment, we lack a
clear plan about what our release cycle would ideally look like.
Furthermore, there are some concerns that the stable release policy is too
conservative and that some packages should be updated more regularly
(notably the installer and the kernel to get more hardware support, but
also tools like SpamAssassin which require frequent updates).  As a result
from our current release management, many people (both developers and
users) are frustrated with various aspects of our release management.  Some
people backport packages, others upgrade to testing or unstable to get
better hardware support.  This results in much duplication of effort,
wasted effort, fragmentation... and frustration.
</p>

<p>
We need a clear release plan&nbsp;&mdash; not just for the coming release,
but one which shows what kind of release cycle we will follow in the next
years&nbsp;&mdash; and we have to actually follow this plan.  This can only
be done if everyone works together, but we first have to come up with a
clear release strategy.  I am interested in working with the release
management team to identify a viable strategy we can follow which best
meets our users' needs.
</p>

<h3>Internal - Core Teams, Delegates, Communication, Transparency</h3>

<p>
Debian's size has grown significantly over the past years, but most of the
core teams have stayed fairly constant.  For example, the security team is
basically the same now as it was when potato was our stable release, but
woody is about twice the size as potato.  We promoted Matt Zimmerman to a
full security member, which has helped a lot, but we still need more help.
However, it is very hard to find people with the interest and time to help.
This problem exists on a larger level.  I have the impression that a large
number of people are interested in maintaining packages, but are less keen
in helping out with core tasks which have to be performed.  I have worked
with many core teams during this term to identify their needs and to help
them find capable people.  Furthermore, there is some frustration among
some developers that the core teams are not as transparent as they should
be, and that their inner workings are not documented very well.  There have
also been problems with communication.  There are several different issues
which need to be addressed, but I think the underlying problem is that our
core teams have not grown as much as the rest of Debian.
</p>

<p>
This problem is fairly complex because adding new members to existing teams
is quite complicated.  You have to find people who have enough time,
interest, and skills.  These people need to work well with the existing
team members, and they must also be able to communicate with a wider
audience.  I have been working with various teams in my term, and progress
is being made.  Comparing the current situation to that a year or a few
years ago, it can be seen that, for example, two new listmasters have been
added, one who mainly deals with requests from users.  The BTS team got an
addition as well, as did the ftpmaster team, and the QA team is growing, as
mentioned before.  Complaints about the New Maintainer process have also
decreased dramatically since I stepped in as DPL.  While progress is being
made, much remains to be done.  I intend to continue to work with core
teams, to identify and address their needs, formalize their status,
document them better to increase transparency, and to improve communication
in the project as a whole.
</p>

<h3>External/internal - Debian based Distributions</h3>

<p>
There are a growing number of distributions based on Debian, some doing
really excellent work and extending Debian in many areas.  Unfortunately,
some of the development which is being done is not integrated back into
Debian.  Furthermore, there is only limited cooperation between the various
Debian based distributions, often leading to duplication of effort.  At the
Open Source World Conference in Spain in February, a meeting between some
representatives was arranged to discuss possible ways to cooperate more
closely.  As the Debian Project Leader, I would see it as my duty not only
to work with these external projects, but to try to internalize them as
much as possible.  This is partly happening already, but I'd like to work
with other projects more closely to drive this process along.  As an
example, Skolelinux (who have always contributed their work to Debian)
first adopted our debian-edu project and are now moving towards using the
debian-edu name as their brand.  Furthermore, after discussions with
developers of DeMuDi (a multimedia distribution based on Debian), they
agreed to join our debian-multimedia project and to merge their work into
Debian.
</p>

<p>
Debian will benefit to a great degree if more Debian based projects get
involved and make contributions.  I am very excited about this because many
of those projects are sponsored by local governments.  Just imagine the great
advances we can make if there are a few paid people in countries like
Brazil, Greece, Norway and Spain (which are all working on Debian based
distributions).  While I cannot control what those projects do, I intend to
work together with them as closely as possible.  Everyone will profit by
more cooperation, and I am interested in helping with the coordination to
make this possible.
</p>

<h3>External - Interacting with Companies</h3>

<p>
I am interested in working with companies to get better support for Debian.
Debian is a very successful distribution, as shown in a recent <a href =
"http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2004/01/28/debian_fastest_growing_linux_distribution.html">Netcraft
survey</a>, and I intend to use the results of this survey to get more
support from companies.  For example, something I recently started is to
approach companies about testing our debian-installer on their hardware to
make sure that our upcoming release will support it properly.  Furthermore,
I'd like to use the power of our community to start a hardware database
which shows which hardware is supported by Debian.  While this database
would initially be maintained by volunteers based on input from users, I
hope that we can get companies to certify their hardware for Debian and
help us maintain this compatibility database.
</p>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>
Debian is a very successful project and we are getting an increased amount
of attention.  There are some problems in our internal structure which we
have to address in order to deal with Debian's success and growth.  These
changes require coordination and interaction with a large number of people.
My coordination skills, together with my approachable nature, and the
experience from my first term as Debian Project Leader, will allow me to
implement important initiatives which are required to ensure Debian's
continued success as a project and as a community.  I hope that I
demonstrated in my first term that I solve problems efficiently, and I ask
you for the opportunity to continue serving as Debian Project Leader.
