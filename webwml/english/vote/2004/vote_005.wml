	      Force the AMD64 into Sarge and into Sid, overriding policy violations.

	  <p>
	   The actual text of the GR is:<br><br>
             <strong>The Debian Project,</strong><br>
	    <p>
                based on its Social Contract stating that its
                priorities are its users and free software,
	    </p>
	    <p>
                and acknowledging that its users want to take
                advantage of all this architecture's features,
	    </p>
	    <p>
                hereby resolves:
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	  	<li>
                   that the next Debian GNU/Linux release, code named
                   <q>sarge</q>, will include the <q>amd64</q>
                   architecture, based on the work currently hosted at
                   <a href="http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/">http://debian-amd64.alioth.debian.org/</a> ;
                </li>
	  	<li>
                    that non-compliance of that <q>amd64</q>
                    distribution with the Linux Standard Base
                    specification for IA32 will not be considered a
                    release-critical bug;

                </li>
	  	<li>
                    that we will include it immediately in the "sid"
                    distribution and auto-building infrastructure, and
                    take all appropriate steps so that inclusion won't
                    delay the release of <q>sarge</q> any further.
                </li>
	    </ol>
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
		 With our current release time frame, AMD64 is likely
		 to become the most sold architecture for personal
		 computers way before the release that will follow
		 sarge. If we don't release sarge with AMD64 support,
		 our users will be very disappointed. The popularity
		 of the debian-amd64 project just shows what they are
		 waiting for.
              </p>
              <p>
		  Furthermore, the AMD64 architecture is mostly
		  ready. It now builds just as many packages as our
		  other release architectures, and it has a working
		  installer.
              </p>
              <p>
		 The only valid reasons for not including it are lack
		 of LSB compliance (which can still be easily achieved
		 with an i386 chroot) and mirror space (which will be
		 saved using partial mirroring). Another reason seems
		 to be the lack of cooperation of some
		 developers. This resolution intends to make everyone
		 cooperate in this direction. Of course, the author of
		 this resolution would welcome if the people
		 responsible would just do it, thereby making this
		 resolution superfluous.
              </p>
