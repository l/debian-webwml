		<H1 class="title">Guidelines</H1>

		<P>Not following some of these steps will not cause a
		proposal to be disqualified.  However, consider them
		to be polite in helping developers to find and
		understand your proposal in mailing lists that already
		generate huge quantities of mail.  All the guidelines
		are included in this <A HREF="proposal.template">template</A>.</p>

		<P>When you've completed your proposal, send it to the
		debian-vote mailing list, signed with your GPG key.
		Proposals will not be recognized when sent to any
		other mailing list or email address.  This is to
		prevent the Project Secretary from missing a proposal
		in the huge volumes of mail generated on some of our
		lists and to mitigate the need for the secretary to
		have to subscribe to each and every list created by
		the Project.  Sponsors must also send email stating
		their intent to the debian-vote list in order to be
		recognized as valid.

		<HR>
                  <H2>Subject</H2>
		First, format the subject of the message like this:
		<PRE>Subject: Proposal - {some description}</PRE> That way, people can
		filter the messages for the proposals.

		<HR><H2>Text</H2>
		<P>If you're proposing a change in the text of a document, state what
		document and include the changes in the same form as a context
		diff file would like (check: <I>info diff (-c)</I> for details).<BR>
		Otherwise, try to be as clear as you can.  State what you want to see
		happen and give the bases of your reason without going into long
		detail.  You can always give the long version during discussion.</p>
		
		<HR><H2>Discussion</H2>

		<p>As a courtesy, start a thread for the discussion of
		the proposal.  This is where you can give all the
		details leading up to the proposal and try to convince
		everybody of what it's a Good Idea(tm).  Set the
		subject to something like</p>
                    <PRE>Discussion - {the same description}</PRE>
		<p>and try to keep the discussion on this tread and leave
		the other tread for sponsors.</p>

		<HR><H2>Mailing</H2>

		<P>Unless told which mailing list to use, mail the proposal to 
		-devel-announce and discussion to -vote.  

		<P>If the proposal is going to require a formal vote using the
		Debian-Vote system, CC the proposal and all sponsors to
		secretary@vote.debian.org.

		<HR>

		<H2><A NAME="amend">Amending</A></H2>

		<P>Proposals can be amended anytime up until the vote has been called.
		A proposal is automatically amended if the original proposer and all
		sponsors agree to the amendment.  If any of them object, the amendment
		must get a like number of sponsors.  When the call for the vote of the
		proposal comes, the proposer of the original proposal calls for the
		vote on the amendments singly, all together or together with the
		original proposal.
