    <p>
      The following procedures have been instituted regarding general
      resolution proposals and sponsoring.
    </p>

    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        The electronic mailing list designated is
        <tt>debian-vote@lists.debian.org</tt>.  This is the
        authoritative source of the full text of all resolutions, as
        well as the supporting arguments and other material. Proposals,
        or sponsorship motions shall not be recognized if sent to any
        other mailing list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every proposal and sponsoring email must be signed with the
        cryptographic key that lives in the Debian keyrings. The
        keyrings are part of the authoritative answer to who is or is
        not a Debian developer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every proposal must clearly indicate the bounds of the
        proposal, which must be clearly delineated from surrounding
        text of the mail message.  Every sponsor must also indicate
        the text they are sponsoring, if only to indicate that they
        recognize the bounds set by the proposer.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the vote is called, the proposer or a sponsor of every
        proposal or amendment must provide a final version of the
        proposal or amendment in wml format for inclusion on the web
        pages of the Debian project. This wml snippet must be verified
        to contain exactly the text that was delineated and sponsored.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the vote is called, the proposer or a sponsor of every
        proposal or amendment must provide a single line (60 character)
        synopsis of their proposal or amendment. This synopsis shall be
        taken into account by the secretary when creating the ballot.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Failing items 4 and 5, the secretary's version shall be deemed
      final. It is strongly suggested that the proposers and sponsors
      be prepared with the matter in question before the end of the
      minimal discussion period, since the vote shall not be delayed
      on account of these missing items.
    </p>

    <h1>Recommended practices and style</h1>

    <p>
      The following is informative as opposed to normative. These
      suggestions would make the it easier to understand, follow, and
      vote upon the proposal. A sample <a
      href="sample_vote.template">template</a> has been provided as a
      starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is good practice to include a concise description of the
      proposal in the subject line of the email. It is recommended
      that the subject line be formatted like 
      <q><em>Subject: Proposal - descriptive text</em></q>, this helps
       people in filtering mails related to the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indicate whether your proposal is an independent proposal, or is
      a formal amendment to an existing proposal. You may create an
      independent proposal addressing the same issue an existing
      proposal does; the difference is mostly one of timing. An
      amendment may not get the full discussion period; and the vote
      may be called before you are done refining your amendment. An
      independent proposal, on the other hand, may not get to be on
      the same ballot as the existing proposal, depending on timing,
      and there could be two independent votes, one for the existing
      proposal, and one for your new independent proposal. The final
      decision lies with you.
    </p>
    <p>
      If your proposal is a change to the text of an existing
      document, providing an actual patch file (as generated by
      <code>diff -u</code>) is a good idea, since it clearly shows
      exactly what changes are being proposed, and helps the person in
      charge of the document if your proposal passes.
    </p>
    <p>
      One suggestion to proposers and sponsors is that the full text
      of the proposal or amendment be put into a separate (perhaps
      in-lined) signed text/plain MIME part, so there is absolutely no
      ambiguity. 
    </p>

    <h2><a name="amend">Amending</a></h2>

           A. Standard Resolution Procedure
            <ul>
              <li>
               1. Discussion and Amendment
                <ul>
                  <li>
                   5. The proposer of a resolution may suggest changes
                    to the wordings of amendments; these take effect
                    if the proposer of the amendment agrees and none
                    of the sponsors object. In this case the changed
                    amendments will be voted on instead of the
                    originals.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                   6. The proposer of a resolution may make changes to
                    correct minor errors (for example, typographical
                    errors or inconsistencies) or changes which do not
                    alter the meaning, providing no one objects within
                    24 hours. In this case the minimum discussion
                    period is not restarted.
