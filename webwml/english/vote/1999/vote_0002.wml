					<P>It is proposed that the Developers of Debian vote
					between a single logo license and a duel logo license
					set in accordance with the General Resolution
					Procedure.</P>
					<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. SINGLE logo license</FONT><BR>
					Debian shall adopt one logo that anyone can use under
					the following license: <BR>
					<CODE>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest 
					this logo or a modified version may be used by anyone to
					refer to the Debian project, but does not indicate 
					endorsement by the project.</CODE><BR>
					<B>Pros</B>: simple, no hassles with multiple
					licenses<BR>
					<B>Cons</B>: we cannot distinguish products which we feel
					are more official or that deserve some official promotion
					except by using a special title.</P>

					<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1. DUEL logo licenses</FONT><BR>
					Debian shall adopt two logos.  One, designated
					<I>liberal</I>, can be used under the following license:<BR>
					<CODE>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest 
					this logo or a modified version may be used by anyone to 
					refer to the Debian project, but does not indicate 
					endorsement by the project.</CODE><BR>
					Another, designated <I>official</I>, can be used under
					the following license:<BR>
					<CODE>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest<BR>
				    I. This logo may only be used if:<BR>
				       a) the product it is used for is made using a documented 
						procedure as published on www.debian.org (for example 
						official CD-creation)<BR>
						or<BR>
				       b) official approval is given by Debian for its use in 
						this purpose<BR>

				   II. may be used if an official part of debian (decided using
					 the rules in I) is part of the complete product, if it is 
					 made clear that only this part is officially approved<BR>

			      III. We reserve the right to revoke a license for a product
					</CODE><BR>
					<B>Pros</B>: allows us to distinguish officially sanctioned
						things while still allowing everyone to use another
						Debian logo<BR>
					<B>Cons</B>: two logos might become confusing or
					complicated.</P>
