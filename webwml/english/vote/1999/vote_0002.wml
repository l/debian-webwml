	<vtext />
	<p>It is proposed that the Developers of Debian vote
	between a single logo license and a dual logo license
	set in accordance with the General Resolution
	Procedure.</p>
	<p><strong>1. SINGLE logo license</strong><br>
	Debian shall adopt one logo that anyone can use under
	the following license: <br>
	<code>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest 
	this logo or a modified version may be used by anyone to
	refer to the Debian project, but does not indicate 
	endorsement by the project.</code><br>
	<B>Pros</B>: simple, no hassles with multiple
	licenses<br>
	<B>Cons</B>: we cannot distinguish products which we feel
	are more official or that deserve some official promotion
	except by using a special title.</p>

	<p><strong>2. DUAL logo licenses</strong><br>
	Debian shall adopt two logos.  One, designated
	<I>liberal</I>, can be used under the following license:<br>
	<code>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest 
	this logo or a modified version may be used by anyone to 
	refer to the Debian project, but does not indicate 
	endorsement by the project.</code><br>
	Another, designated <I>official</I>, can be used under
	the following license:<br>
	<code>Copyright (c) 1999 Software in the Public Interest<br>
    I. This logo may only be used if:<br>
       a) the product it is used for is made using a documented 
	procedure as published on www.debian.org (for example 
	official CD-creation)<br>
	or<br>
       b) official approval is given by Debian for its use in 
	this purpose<br>

   II. may be used if an official part of debian (decided using
	 the rules in I) is part of the complete product, if it is 
	 made clear that only this part is officially approved<br>

     III. We reserve the right to revoke a license for a product
	</code><br>
	<B>Pros</B>: allows us to distinguish officially sanctioned
	things while still allowing everyone to use another
	Debian logo<br>
	<B>Cons</B>: two logos might become confusing or
	complicated.</p>


	<vquorum />
	<p>With 497 developers, Q=22.29 making a quorum of 67</p>


	<vmindiscuss />
	<p>Wichert Akkerman can call for vote
	anytime after April 13th.</p>
