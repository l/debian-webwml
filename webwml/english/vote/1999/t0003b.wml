(Note that I'm rather tired at the moment, and, well I will make a
effort to make this readable for it to be looking nice, readable is my
goal and someone should probably rewrite it after a bit of sleep)

Well option number 4[0] is a very nice logo, and it looks very nice, it
has one major problem, specificly it is extremely Linux specific[1], to
the point that it is, as far as I can see, not repairable to no longer
be Linux specific well keeping its same basic form[2].

In my personal view it may make a very fine Debian GNU/Linux logo,
however Debian is not just Linux, it is also Hurd, and in the future it
may very well have other 'ports'[3], choosing a logo for the Debian
project as a whole which indicates that we are simply a Linux
distribution would be very misleading, and possibly harmful to the other
'ports'..

As such, I propose that it be disqualified, and as such removed from the
ballot, possibly to be included in a later ballot[4]..

Zephaniah E. Hull.

0: Titled 'guatamnlad', a stylized D.
1: Not the words, those can be changed or removed, but the large L on
the lower left hand corner..
2: The L makes up a good part of the logo, thus removing it or altering
it to be something else would change the basic form..
3: Various flavors of BSD have been mentioned, as well a somewhat joking
talks of some form of a Windows port, and one or two others..
