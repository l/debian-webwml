This has taken way too long, and I apoligize for that. But I hereby
present the best logos for your voting pleasure, as selected by the
logo team. Please note that the winning logo might need some
modifications before it can be used.=20

Here is the list of logos, with some personal comments from me. You
can view them online at http://www.debian.org/~wakkerma/logos/ .

* jeanette (ants)
Concept: Debian is a lot of people working together to produce some
  great things, just like ants.
Pros: strong imagery, official and liberal logo with the same theme
  but still different.
Cons: official and liberal logo might be too different

* raul (swirl)
Concept: magic being release from a genie bottle.
Pros: simple, good associations, already in a good format (EPS)
Cons: none :)

* villate (seal)
Concept: seal balancing the world
Note: should be modified to be an outline
Pros: playful, cute
Cons: needs some hard work to modify it to an outline

* guatamnlad (stylized D)
Note: animal in the background should be removed
Concept: modified D
Pros: simple, elegant
Cons: not very noticable compared to other logos (oh, a big letter?)

* captain blue-eye (the current logo)
Concept: modified version of Tux (the Linux penguin)
Pros: people already know it
Cons: too Linux-specific


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hereby propose to choose the new logo by General Resolution.

The ballot will contain the options:

1) jeanette (ants)
2) raul (swirl / genie)
3) villate (seal)
4) guatamnlad (stylized D)
5) captain blue-eye (the current logo)
6) further discussion

There are 497 registered voters.  That makes Q 22.29 and the quorum
67 votes. =20

Though there is normally a two week discussion period followed by a
two week voting period, I am shortening the discussion period to one
week.
