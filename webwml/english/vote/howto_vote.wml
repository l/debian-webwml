HOW TO VOTE

Erase everything above the top "-=-=-=-" line and erase everything
below the bottom "-=-=-=-" line.  Do not erase anything between these
lines and do not change the group names.

In the brackets next to your preferred choice for group name, place a
1.  Place a 2 in the brackets next to your next choice.  Continue till
you use 3 for your last choice.  You may leave choices you consider
unacceptable blank.  Start with 1, don't skip any numbers, don't repeat.

Then mail the ballot to: sample@vote.debian.org.  Just Replying to this
message should work, but check the "To:" line.  Don't worry about spacing
of the columns or any quote characters ("&gt;") that your reply inserts.

responsibility to make sure your vote is registered correctly.

Only one vote per person, no more than one vote per account.  Addresses and
votes of all voters will be published in the final voting results list.
