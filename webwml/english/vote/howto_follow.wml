		<H1 class="title">Standard Resolution Procedure</H1>

		<P>A proposal can be introduced by any developer by posting a message
		on any qualified mailing list.  A qualified mailing list is any
		"publicly-readable electronic mailing list designated by the Project
		Leader's Delegate(s)."  The mailing list debian-vote@lists.debian.org
		has been delegated by the project secretary.  There is no required text
		for a proposal but here are some <A HREF="./howto_proposal">
		guidelines</A>.

		<HR><H2>Introduction</H2>
		<P>A proposal is considered formally introduced if it has been
		proposed by either the Project Leader or the Technical Committee.
		Otherwise, the proposal needs five (5) additional sponsors before it
		is open for discussion.  </P>

		<HR><H2>Discussion</H2>
		<P>A proposal stays in
		discussion for a minimum of two (2) weeks.  Anytime
		after that, the original proposer or one of the five
		sponsors may call for the vote.  The vote doesn't
		follow discussion automatically.  The Project Leader
		may allow the call to vote to be made up to a week
		early or require the discussion period to extend up to
		another week.

		<HR><H2>Voting</H2>
		<P>After the vote has been called for, a ballot is mailed to the
		designated mailing list.  The developers fill out the ballot and mail
		it back to the address indicated in the ballot.  The voting period
		lasts two weeks (but can be shortened or lengthened by one week by the
		Project Leaders discretion).</p>  

		<P>The Debian Vote Engine will process the vote and
		mail an acknowledgement back to the voter.  After the
		voting period has ended, the outcome of the vote as
		well as each voter and their vote will be made posted
		to the mailing list.  The complete text of each vote
		will be placed on the website, except for Debian
		Project Leader election votes,which are deemed secret
		ballot. In that case, the vote engine takes steps to
		ensure the anonymity of the voter, while ensuring that
		each voter can still validate their own votes.</p>
		
		<HR><H2>Amendments</H2>
		<P>Amendments to a proposal can be made if the proposal's proposer and
		all five (5) sponsors agree.  If any of them object, the amendment
		starts this process by first getting five (5) sponsors of it's own.  At
		the time of voting, the amendments become options or forms of the
		proposal to be voted on.</p>
