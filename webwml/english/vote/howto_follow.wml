		<H2>Proposal</H2>
		<P>A proposal can be introduced by any developer by posting a message
		on any qualified mailing list.  A qualified mailing list is any
		"publicly-readable electronic mailing list designated by the Project
		Leader's Delegate(s)."  As of yet, no mailing list had been designated
		so we're using -devel and -devel-announce.  There is no required text
		for a proposal but here are some <A HREF="./howto_proposal">
		guidelines</A>.

		<HR><H2>Introduction</H2>
		<P>A proposal is considered formally introduced if it has been
		proposed by either the Project Leader or the Technical Committee.
		Otherwise, the proposal needs five (5) additional sponsors before it
		is open for discussion.  Until the proposal is accepted this way, it's
		not open for discussion.. at least not officially.

		<HR><H2>Discussion</H2>
		<P>A proposal stays in discussion for a minimum of two (2) weeks.
		Anytime after that, the original proposer or one of the five sponsors 
		may call for the vote.  The vote doesn't follow discussion automatically.
		The Project Leader, at his discretion, may allow the call to vote to be
		made up to a week early or require the discussion period to extend up to
		another week.

		<HR><H2>Voting</H2>
		<P>After the vote has been called for, a ballot is mailed to the
		designated mailing list.  The developers fill out the ballot and mail
		it back to the address indicated in the ballot.  The voting period
		lasts two weeks (but can be shortened or lengthened by one week by the
		Project Leader at his discretion).  The voting period can be cut short
		by the Project Secretary if the outcome of the vote becomes obvious.
		<P>The Debian-Voting system will process the vote and mail an
		acknowledgement back to the voter.  After the voting period has ended,
		the outcome of the vote as well as each voter and their vote will be
		made posted to the mailing list.  The complete text of each vote will
		be placed on the website.
		
		<HR><H2>Amendments</H2>
		<P>Amendments to a proposal can be made if the proposal's proposer and
		all five (5) sponsors agree.  If any of them object, the amendment
		starts this process by first getting five (5) sponsors of it's own.  At
		the time of voting, the amendments become options or forms of the
		proposal to be voted on.
