<ol>
<li>The Debian project decides to accept a code of conduct for
   participants to its mailinglists, IRC channels, and other modes of
   communication within the project.

<li>Updates to this code of conduct should be made by the DPL or the

   Developers as a whole through the general resolution procedure.

<li>The initial text of the code of conduct follows, in markdown format.

<ol>
<li>The Debian project decides to accept a code of conduct for
   participants to its mailinglists, IRC channels, and other modes of
   communication within the project.

<li>The initial text of this code of conduct replaces the "mailinglist
   code of conduct" at http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/#codeofconduct

<li>Updates to this code of conduct should follow the normal GR
   procedure. However, the DPL (or the DPL's delegates) can add or
   remove links to other documents in the "Further reading" section
   after consultation with the project and without requiring a GR.

<h3>Initial text of the code of conduct</h3>

\# Debian Code of Conduct

\## Be respectful

In a project the size of Debian, inevitably there will be people with
whom you may disagree, or find it difficult to cooperate. Accept that,
but even so, remain respectful. Disagreement is no excuse for poor
behaviour or personal attacks, and a community in which people feel
threatened is not a healthy community.

\## Assume good faith

Debian Contributors have many ways of reaching our common goal of a
[free](http://www.debian.org/intro/free) operating system which may
differ from your ways. Assume that other people are working towards this
goal.

Note that many of our Contributors are not native English speakers or
may have different cultural backgrounds

\## Be collaborative

Debian is a large and complex project; there is always more to learn
within Debian. It's good to ask for help when you need it. Similarly,
offers for help should be seen in the context of our shared goal of
improving Debian.

When you make something for the benefit of the project, be willing to
explain to others how it works, so that they can build on your work to
make it even better.

\## Try to be concise

Keep in mind that what you write once will be read by hundreds of
persons. Writing a short email means people can understand the
conversation as efficiently as possible. When a long explanation is
necessary, consider adding a summary.

Try to bring new arguments to a conversation so that each mail adds
something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the
thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have
already been made.

Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly
large.

\## Be open

Most ways of communication used within Debian allow for public and
private communication. As per paragraph three of the [social
contract](http://www.debian.org/social_contract), you should preferably
use public methods of communication for Debian-related messages, unless
posting something sensitive.

This applies to messages for help or Debian-related support, too; not
only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer
to your question, it also makes sure that any inadvertent mistakes made
by people answering your question will be more easily detected and
corrected.

\## In case of problems

While this code of conduct should be adhered to by participants, we
recognize that sometimes people may have a bad day, or be unaware of
some of the guidelines in this code of conduct. When that happens, you may
reply to them and point out this code of conduct. Such messages may be
in public or in private, whatever is most appropriate. However,
regardless of whether the message is public or not, it should still
adhere to the relevant parts of this code of conduct; in particular, it
should not be abusive or disrespectful. Assume good faith; it is more
likely that participants are unaware of their bad behaviour than that
they intentionally try to degrade the quality of the discussion.

Serious or persistent offenders will be temporarily or permanently
banned from communicating through Debian's systems. Complaints should be
made (in private) to the administrators of the Debian communication
forum in question. To find contact information for these administrators,
please see [the page on Debian's organizational
structure](http://www.debian.org/intro/organization)

\# Further reading

Some of the links in this section do not refer to documents that are
part of this code of conduct, nor are they authoritative within Debian.
However, they all do contain useful information on how to conduct
oneself on our communication channels.

- Debian has a [diversity statement](http://www.debian.org/intro/diversity)
- The [Debian Community Guidelines](http://people.debian.org/~enrico/dcg/)
  by Enrico Zini contain some advice on how to communicate effectively.
