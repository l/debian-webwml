0. Rationale

  Debian has decided (via the technical committee) to change its
  default init system for the next release. The technical committee
  decided not to decide about the question of "coupling" i.e. whether
  other packages in Debian may depend on a particular init system.

  This GR seeks to preserve the freedom of our users now to select an
  init system of their choice, and the project's freedom to select a
  different init system in the future. It will avoid Debian becoming
  accidentally locked in to a particular init system (for example,
  because so much unrelated software has ended up depending on a
  particular init system that the burden of effort required to change
  init system becomes too great). A number of init systems exist, and
  it is clear that there is not yet broad consensus as to what the
  best init system might look like.

  This GR does not make any comment on the relative merits of
  different init systems; the technical committee has decided upon the
  default init system for Linux for jessie.

1. Exercise of the TC's power to set policy

  For jessie and later releases, the TC's power to set technical
  policy (Constitution 6.1.1) is exercised as follows:

2. Loose coupling of init systems

  In general, software may not require a specific init system to be
  pid 1.  The exceptions to this are as follows:

   * alternative init system implementations
   * special-use packages such as managers for init systems
   * cooperating groups of packages intended for use with specific init
     systems

  provided that these are not themselves required by other software
  whose main purpose is not the operation of a specific init system.

  Degraded operation with some init systems is tolerable, so long as
  the degradation is no worse than what the Debian project would
  consider a tolerable (non-RC) bug even if it were affecting all
  users.  So the lack of support for a particular init system does not
  excuse a bug nor reduce its severity; but conversely, nor is a bug
  more serious simply because it is an incompatibility of some software
  with some init system(s).

  Maintainers are encouraged to accept technically sound patches
  to enable improved interoperation with various init systems.

3. Notes and rubric

  This resolution is a Position Statement about Issues of the Day
  (Constitution 4.1.5), triggering the General Resolution override
  clause in the TC's resolution of the 11th of February.

  The TC's decision on the default init system for Linux in jessie
  stands undisturbed.

  However, the TC resolution is altered to add the additional text
  in sections (1) and (2) above.

	<h3>Choice 2: </h3>
<pre>
Debian has decided (via the technical committee) to change its default
init system for the next release. The technical committee decided not to
decide about the question of "coupling" i.e. whether other packages in
Debian may depend on a particular init system.  However, the technical
committee stated in #746715 that "[it] expects maintainers to continue to
support the multiple available init systems in Debian.  That includes
merging reasonable contributions, and not reverting existing support
without a compelling reason."

The Debian Project states that:

   Software should support as many architectures as reasonably possible,
   and it should normally support the default init system on all
   architectures for which it is built.  There are some exceptional cases
   where lack of support for the default init system may be appropriate,
   such as alternative init system implementations, special-use packages
   such as managers for non-default init systems, and cooperating
   groups of packages intended for use with non-default init systems.
   However, package maintainers should be aware that a requirement for a
   non-default init system will mean the software will be unusable for
   most Debian users and should normally be avoided.

   Package maintainers are strongly encouraged to merge any contributions
   for support of any init system, and to add that support themselves if
   they're willing and capable of doing so.  In particular, package
   maintainers should put a high priority on merging changes to support
   any init system which is the default on one of Debian's non-Linux
   ports.

   For the jessie release, all software that currently supports being run
   under sysvinit should continue to support sysvinit unless there is no
   technically feasible way to do so.  Reasonable changes to preserve
   or improve sysvinit support should be accepted through the jessie
   release.  There may be some loss of functionality under sysvinit if
   that loss is considered acceptable by the package maintainer and
   the package is still basically functional, but Debian's standard
   requirement to support smooth upgrades from wheezy to jessie still
   applies, even when the system is booted with sysvinit.

The Debian Project makes no statement at this time on sysvinit support
beyond the jessie release.


This resolution is a Position Statement about Issues of the Day
(Constitution 4.1.5), triggering the General Resolution override clause
in the TC's resolution of the 11th of February.

The TC's decision on the default init system for Linux in jessie stands
undisturbed.

However, the TC resolution is altered to add the additional text above.
