                    <h2>0: Summary</h2>
                    <p>
                      Within the Debian community there has been a
                      significant amount of concern about the GNU Free
                      Documentation License (GFDL), and whether it is, in
                      fact, a <q>free</q> license. This document attempts to
                      explain why Debian's answer is <q>no</q>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It should be noted that this does not imply any
                      hostility towards the Free Software Foundation, and
                      does not mean that GFDL documentation should not be
                      considered "free enough" by others, and Debian itself
                      will continue distributing GFDL documentation in its
                      <q>non-free</q> section.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h2>1: What is the GFDL?</h2>
                    
                    <p>
                      The GFDL is a license written by the Free Software
                      Foundation, who use it as a license for their own
                      documentation, and promote it to others. It is also
                      used as Wikipedia's license. To quote the GFDL's
                      Preamble:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or
                      other functional and useful document "free" in the sense of
                      freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and
                      redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either
                      commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
                      preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for
                      their work, while not being considered responsible for
                      modifications made by others.
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                      This License is a kind of <q>copyleft</q>, which means that
                      derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the
                      same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which
                      is a copyleft license designed for free software.
                    </blockquote>

                    <h2>(2) How does it fail to meet Debian's standards for Free Software?</h2>
                    <p>
                      The GFDL conflicts with traditional requirements for free software in
                      a variety of ways, some of which are expanded upon below. As a copyleft
                      license, one of the consequences of this is that it is not possible to
                      include content from a documention directly into free software under
                      the GFDL.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The major conflicts are:
                    </p>

                    <h3>(2.1) Invariant Sections</h3>

                    <p>
                      The most troublesome conflict concerns the class of invariant
                      sections that, once included, may not be modified or removed
                      from the documentation in future. Modifiability is, however, a
                      fundamental requirement of the DFSG, which states:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>
                        3. Derived Works
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The license must allow modifications and derived works, and
                        must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the
                        license of the original software.
                      </p>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>
                      Invariant sections create particular problems in reusing small
                      portions of the work (since any invariant sections must be
                      included also, however large), and in making sure the
                      documentation remains accurate and relevant.
                    </p>

                    <h3>(2.2) Transparent Copies</h3>

                    <p>
                      The second conflict is related to the GFDL's requirements for
                      <q>transparent copies</q> of documentation (that is, a copy of the
                      documentation in a form suitable for editing). In particular,
                      Section 3 of the GFDL requires that a transparent copy of the
                      documentation be included with every opaque copy distributed, or
                      that a transparent copy is made available for a year after the
                      opaque copies are no longer being distributed.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      For free software works, Debian expects that simply providing
                      the source (or transparent copy) alongside derivative works will
                      be sufficient, but this does not satisfy either clause of the
                      GFDL's requirements.
                    </p>

                    <h3>(2.3) Digital Rights Management</h3>

                    <p>
                      The third conflict with the GFDL arises from the measures in
                      Section 2 that attempt to overcome Digital Rights Management
                      (DRM) technologies. In particular, the GFDL states that <em>You
                        may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the
                        reading or further copying of the copies you make or
                        distribute</em>. This inhibits freedom in three ways: it limits
                      use of the documentation as well as distribution, by covering
                      all copies made, as well as copies distributed; it rules out
                      distributing copies on DRM-protected media, even if done in such
                      a way as to give users full access to a transparent copy of the
                      work; and, as written, it also potentially disallows encrypting
                      the documentation, or even storing it on a filesystem that
                      supports permissions.
                    </p>

                    <h2>(3) Why does documentation need to be Free Software?</h2>

                    <p>
                      There are a number of obvious differences between programs and
                      documentation that often inspire people to ask "why not simply
                      have different standards for the two?" For example, books are
                      often written by individuals, while programs are written by
                      teams, so proper credit for a book might be more important than
                      proper credit for a program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      On the other hand, free software is often written by a single
                      person, and free software documentation is often written by a
                      larger group of contributors.  And the line between what is
                      documentation and what is a program is not always so clear
                      either, as content from one is often needed in the other (to
                      provide online help, to provide screenshots or interactive
                      tutorials, to provide a more detailed explanation by quoting
                      some of the source code). Similarly, while not all programs
                      demonstrate creativity or could be considered <q>works of
                        art</q>, some can, and trying to determine which is the case
                      for all the software in Debian would be a distraction from our
                      goals.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      In practice, then, documentation simply isn't different enough
                      to warrant different standards: we still wish to provide source
                      code in the same manner as for programs, we still wish to be
                      able to modify and reuse documentation in other documentation
                      and programs as conveniently as possible, and we wish to be able
                      to provide our users with exactly the documentation they want,
                      without extraneous materials.
                    </p>

                    <h2>(4) How can this be fixed?</h2>

                    <p>
                      What, then, can documentation authors and others do about this?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      An easy first step is to not include the optional invariant sections in
                      your documentation, since they are not required by the license, but are
                      simply an option open to authors.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Unfortunately this alone is not enough, as other clauses of the
                      GFDL render all GFDL documentation non-free. As a consequence,
                      other licenses should be investigated; generally it is probably
                      simplest to choose either the GNU General Public License (for a
                      copyleft license) or the BSD or MIT licenses (for a non-copyleft
                      license).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      As most GFDL documentation is made available under <em>the terms
                        of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 or any
                        later version published by the Free Software Foundation</em>,
                      the Free Software Foundation is able to remedy these problems by
                      changing the license. The problems discussed above require
                      relatively minor changes to the GFDL -- allowing invariant
                      sections to be removed, allowing transparent copies to be made
                      available concurrently, and moderating the restrictions on
                      technical measures.  Unfortunately, while members of the Debian
                      Project have been in contact with the FSF about these concerns
                      for the past four years, these negotiations have not come to any
                      conclusion to date.

	  <vamendmenttext />
	  <p>
	   The actual text of the amendment is:
    <p>
      This is the position of Debian Project about the GNU Free
      Documentation License as published by the Free Software
      Foundation:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          We consider that the GNU Free Documentation License version
          1.2 conflicts with traditional requirements for free
          software in a variety of ways, explained in detail in the
          <q>Problems of the GFDL</q> section below.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most grave of these problems are the so-called
          "invariant sections", which are non-removable,
          non-modifiable parts of the document that the GFDL allows in
          works under this license. However, modifiability is a
          fundamental requirement of the Debian Free Software
          Guidelines, so this restriction is not acceptable for us.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          We believe that works licensed under the GFDL that include
          no such unmodifiable sections do fully meet the spirit of
          the Debian Free Software Guidelines, and have a place in our
          distribution despite the other problems (minor, in
          comparison) that the GFDL has.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formally, the Debian Project will include in the main
          section of its distribution works licensed under the GNU
          Free Documentation License that include no Invariant
          Sections, no Cover Texts, no Acknowledgements, and no
          Dedications, unless permission to remove them is granted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Despite the compromise above, GFDL'd documentation is still
          not free of trouble: as an example, it is incompatible with
          the major free software licenses, which means that GFDL'd
          text can't be incorporated into free programs.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this reason, we encourage documentation authors to
          license their works (or dual-license, together with the
          GFDL) under a well known free software license like the the
          GPL or the BSD license.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Problems of the GFDL</h2>

    <h3>I. The DRM Restriction</h3>
    <p>
      Section 2 (Verbatim Copying) of the GFDL goes beyond the
      traditional source requirement in copyleft licenses in an
      important way: according to the GFDL no copy may ever be subject
      to <em>technical measures to obstruct or control</em> reading
      and copying. This means that:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        It is not limited to the act of distribution (i.e., it applies
        to private copies as well).
      </li>
      <li>
        It rules out the possibility that a version be distributed on
        some form of DRM media (for technical reasons, perhaps), even
        while providing source (i.e., a transparent copy) in an
        unencumbered way at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        As written, it would outlaw actions like changing the
        permission of a copy of the document on your machine, storing
        it on an encrypted file system, distributing a copy over an
        encrypted link (Obstruct or control the reading is not
        clarified to apply merely to the recipient), or even storing
        it on a file-sharing system with non-world-readable
        permissions.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Consider that the GFDL currently prohibits distribution on DRM
      media, as compared to the GPL which requires distribution on
      non-DRM media.  This is a serious additional restriction.
    </p>

    <h3>II. Transparent And Opaque Copies</h3>
    <p>
      Section 3 (Copying in Quantity) of the GFDL states that it is
      not enough to just put a transparent copy of a document
      alongside with the opaque version when you are distributing it
      (which is all that you need to do for sources under the GPL, for
      example). Instead, the GFDL insists that you must somehow
      include a machine-readable Transparent copy (i.e., not allow the
      opaque form to be downloaded without the transparent form) or
      keep the transparent form available for download at a publicly
      accessible location for one year after the last distribution of
      the opaque form.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is our belief that as long as you make the source and
      binaries available so that the users can see what's available
      and take what they want, you have done what is required of
      you. It is up to the user whether to download the transparent
      form.
    </p>

    <p>
      The requirements for redistributors should be to make sure the
      users can get the transparent form, not to force users to
      download the transparent form even if they don't want it.
    </p>

    <h3>III. Invariant Sections</h3>
 

    <p>
      This is the most troublesome part of the GFDL.
    </p>

    <p>
      The GNU FDL includes a number of conditions that apply to all
      modified versions that disallow modifications. Specifically,
      Section 4 of the GFDL describes the invariant sections that must
      be unaltered in their text and in their titles in any derived
      works. These invariant sections must be secondary sections; a
      secondary section is a named appendix or a front-matter section
      of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of
      the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's
      overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing
      that could fall directly within that overall subject. These
      parts include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Invariant Sections</li>
      <li>Cover Texts</li>
      <li>Acknowledgements</li>
      <li>Dedications</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      However, modifiability is a fundamental requirement of the
      Debian Free Software Guidelines, which state:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
     3. Derived Works

     The license must allow modifications and derived works, and
     must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as the
     license of the original software.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      As such, we cannot accept works that include "Invariant
      Sections" and similar unmodifiable components into our
      distribution.
    </p>

	  <p>
             Since this amendment would require modification of a
             foundation document, namely, the 
             <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">Social Contract</a>,
             it requires a 3:1 majority to pass.
	  </p>


	  <vquorum />
	  <p>

	With <a href="vote_001.quorum.log">961 developers</a>,
	we have:
             <pre>
 Current Developer Count = 961
 Q ( sqrt(#devel) / 2 ) = 15.5
 K min(5, Q )           = 5
 Quorum  (3 x Q )       = 46.5

           </pre>


          <vstatistics />
          <p>
            To be collected.
         </p>



	  <vmajorityreq />
	  <p>
             Option 2 requires a 3:1 majority, since it modifies the
             Social contract, a foundation document.
          </p>

	  <voutcome />

	    <p>
	      To be decided.
