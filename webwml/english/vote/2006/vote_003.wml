-9. Software in the Public Interest

    SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some goals. Debian
-    is grateful for the legal support framework offered by SPI. Debian's
-   Developers are currently members of SPI by virtue of their status as
-   Developers.

-  9.1. Authority
-
-    1. SPI has no authority regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical
-       decisions, except that no decision by Debian with respect to any
-       property held by SPI shall require SPI to act outside its legal
-       authority, and that Debian's constitution may occasionally use SPI
-       as a decision body of last resort.
-    2. Debian claims no authority over SPI other than that over the use
-       of certain of SPI's property, as described below, though Debian
-       Developers may be granted authority within SPI by SPI's rules.
-    3. Debian Developers are not agents or employees of SPI, or of each
-       other or of persons in authority in the Debian Project. A person
-       acting as a Developer does so as an individual, on their own
-       behalf.

-  9.2. Management of property for purposes related to Debian

-   Since Debian has no authority to hold money or property, any donations
-   for the Debian Project must be made to SPI, which manages such
-   affairs.

-   SPI have made the following undertakings:
-    1. SPI will hold money, trademarks and other tangible and intangible
-       property and manage other affairs for purposes related to Debian.
-    2. Such property will be accounted for separately and held in trust
-       for those purposes, decided on by Debian and SPI according to this
-       section.
-    3. SPI will not dispose of or use property held in trust for Debian
-       without approval from Debian, which may be granted by the Project
-       Leader or by General Resolution of the Developers.
-    4. SPI will consider using or disposing of property held in trust for
-       Debian when asked to do so by the Project Leader.
-    5. SPI will use or dispose of property held in trust for Debian when
-       asked to do so by a General Resolution of the Developers, provided
-       that this is compatible with SPI's legal authority.
-    6. SPI will notify the Developers by electronic mail to a Debian
-       Project mailing list when it uses or disposes of property held in
-       trust for Debian.

========================================================================
+9. Assets held in trust for Debian

+  In most jurisdictions around the world, the Debian project is not
+  in a position to directly hold funds or other property. Therefore,
+  property has to be owned by any of a number of organisations as
+  detailed in §9.2
+
+   Traditionally, SPI was the sole organisation authorized to hold
+   property and monies for the Debian Project.  SPI was created in
+   the U.S. to hold money in trust there.
+
    SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some
    goals. Debian is grateful for the legal support framework offered
+   by SPI. 

+   9.1 Relationship with Associated Organizations
+
+     1. Debian Developers do not become agents or employees of
+        organisations holding assets in trust for Debian, or of
+        each other, or of persons in authority in the Debian Project,
+        solely by the virtue of being Debian Developers. A person
+        acting as a Developer  does so as an individual, on their own
+        behalf. Such organisations may, of their own accord,
+        establish relationships with individuals who are also Debian
+        developers.

+   9.2. Authority

+    1. An organisation holding assets for Debian has no authority
+       regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical decisions, except
+       that no decision by Debian with respect to any property held
+       by the organisation shall require it to act outside its legal
+       authority. 
+    2. Debian claims no authority over an organisation that holds
+       assets for Debian other than that over the use of property
+       held in trust for Debian. 

+   9.3. Trusted organisations

+   Any donations for the Debian Project must be made to any one of a
+   set of organisations designated by the Project leader (or a
+   delegate) to be authorized to handle assets to be used for the
+   Debian Project. 
+
+   Organisations holding assets in trust for Debian should
+   undertake reasonable obligations for the handling of such
+   assets.
+
+   Debian maintains a public List of Trusted Organisations that
+   accept donations and hold assets in trust for Debian
+   (including both tangible property and intellectual property)
+   that includes the commitments those organisations have made as
+   to how those assets will be handled.
