-9. Software in the Public Interest

    SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some goals. Debian
-    is grateful for the legal support framework offered by SPI. Debian's
-   Developers are currently members of SPI by virtue of their status as
-   Developers.

-  9.1. Authority
-
-    1. SPI has no authority regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical
-       decisions, except that no decision by Debian with respect to any
-       property held by SPI shall require SPI to act outside its legal
-       authority, and that Debian's constitution may occasionally use SPI
-       as a decision body of last resort.
-    2. Debian claims no authority over SPI other than that over the use
-       of certain of SPI's property, as described below, though Debian
-       Developers may be granted authority within SPI by SPI's rules.
-    3. Debian Developers are not agents or employees of SPI, or of each
-       other or of persons in authority in the Debian Project. A person
-       acting as a Developer does so as an individual, on their own
-       behalf.

-  9.2. Management of property for purposes related to Debian

-   Since Debian has no authority to hold money or property, any donations
-   for the Debian Project must be made to SPI, which manages such
-   affairs.

    SPI have made the following undertakings:
     1. SPI will hold money, trademarks and other tangible and intangible
        property and manage other affairs for purposes related to Debian.
     2. Such property will be accounted for separately and held in trust
        for those purposes, decided on by Debian and SPI according to this
        section.
     3. SPI will not dispose of or use property held in trust for Debian
        without approval from Debian, which may be granted by the Project
        Leader or by General Resolution of the Developers.
     4. SPI will consider using or disposing of property held in trust for
        Debian when asked to do so by the Project Leader.
     5. SPI will use or dispose of property held in trust for Debian when
        asked to do so by a General Resolution of the Developers, provided
        that this is compatible with SPI's legal authority.
     6. SPI will notify the Developers by electronic mail to a Debian
        Project mailing list when it uses or disposes of property held in
        trust for Debian.

========================================================================
+9. Assets held in trust for Debian

+  Debian is not a legal entity (in any country in the world), and as such
+  cannot own any money or other property. Therefore, property has
+  to be ownedby any of a number of organisations as detailed in
+  §9.2
+
+   Traditionally, SPI was the sole organisation authorized to hold
+   property and monies for the Debian Project.  SPI was created in
+   the U.S. to hold money in trust there.
+
    SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some
    goals. Debian is grateful for the legal support framework offered
+   by SPI. 

+   9.1 Relationship with Associated Organizations
+
+     1. Debian Developers do not become agents or employees of
+        organisations holding assets in trust for Debian, or of
+        each other, or of persons in authority in the Debian Project,
+        solely by the virtue of being Debian Developers. A person
+        acting as a Developer  does so as an individual, on their own
+        behalf. Such organisations may, of their own accord,
+        establish relationships with individuals who are also Debian
+        developers.

+   9.2. Authority

+    1. An organisation holding assets for Debian has no authority
+       regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical decisions, except
+       that no decision by Debian with respect to any property held
+       by the organisation shall require it to act outside its legal
+       authority. An exception to asset-holding organisations not having
+       any authority regarding decisions taken by the Debian project is that
+       that Debian's constitution may occasionally use SPI as a 
+       decision body of last resort (see § 7.2).
+    2. Debian claims no authority over an organisation that holds
+       assets for Debian other than that over the use of property
+       held in trust for Debian. Debian Developers may be granted
+       authority within such an organisation, subject to the
+       organisation's decision and rules.

+   9.3. Management of property for purposes related to Debian

+   Debian has no authority to hold money or property.  Any
+   donations for the Debian Project must be made to any one of a set
+   of organisations designated by the Project leader (or a delegate)
+   to be authorized to handle assets  to be used for the Debian
+   Project. Such authorization, or its withdrawal, and annual reports
+   of Debian-related activities by such organisations must be
+   published by announcement on a publicly-readable electronic
+   mailing list designated by the Project Leader or their  Delegate(s);
+   any Developer may post there. 
+
+   Organisations holding assets in trust for Debian should
+   undertake reasonable obligations for the handling of such
+   assets.
+
+    As an example of best practice at the time of writing,
    SPI have made the following undertakings:
     1. SPI will hold money, trademarks and other tangible and intangible
        property and manage other affairs for purposes related to Debian.
     2. Such property will be accounted for separately and held in trust
        for those purposes, decided on by Debian and SPI according to this
        section.
     3. SPI will not dispose of or use property held in trust for Debian
        without approval from Debian, which may be granted by the Project
        Leader or by General Resolution of the Developers.
     4. SPI will consider using or disposing of property held in trust for
        Debian when asked to do so by the Project Leader.
     5. SPI will use or dispose of property held in trust for Debian when
        asked to do so by a General Resolution of the Developers, provided
        that this is compatible with SPI's legal authority.
     6. SPI will notify the Developers by electronic mail to a Debian
        Project mailing list when it uses or disposes of property held in
        trust for Debian.

      For this GR, as always <a id="suppl_001_stats">statistics</a>
      shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements
      sent periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the
      list of <a id="vote_001_voters.txt">voters</a> would be made
      publicly available. Also, the <a id="vote_001_tally.txt">tally

      Since general resolution would require modification of a
      foundation document, namely, the <a

      requires a 3:1 majority to pass.

    <voutcome />
    <h3>The outcome</h3>
    <p>To Be determined</p>


    <p>
      Debian uses the Condorcet method for votes. 
      Simplistically, plain Condorcets method
      can be stated like so : <br />
      <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
        The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
        candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
        race with that candidate.</q>
      The problem is that in complex elections, there may well be a
      circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C, and C
      beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use various means
      of resolving the tie. See <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof
      Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a> for details. Debian's variation
      is spelled out in the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the
      constitution</a>, specifically, A.6.
