    <h2>Release Etch even with kernel firmware issues</h2>

    <ol>
       <li>
          <p>
              We affirm that our Priorities are our users and the free
              software community (Social Contract #4);
          </p>
       </li>
       <li>
          <p>
             We acknowledge that there is a lot of progress in the
             kernel firmware issue; however, it is not yet finally
             sorted out;
          </p>
       </li>
       <li>
          <p>
            We assure the community that there will be no regressions
            in the progress made for freedom in the kernel distributed
            by Debian relative to the Sarge release in Etch
          </p>
       </li>
       <li>
          <p>
            We give priority to the timely release of Etch over
            sorting every bit out; for this reason, we will treat
            removal of sourceless firmware as a best-effort process,
            and deliver firmware in udebs as long as it is necessary
            for installation (like all udebs), and firmware included
            in the kernel itself as part of Debian Etch, as long as we
            are legally allowed to do so, and the firmware is
            distributed upstream under a license that complies with
            the DFSG.

    <h2>Special exception to DFSG #2 for firmware as long as required</h2>
    <h3>THE DEBIAN PROJECT</h3>
    <ol>
       <li>
         <p>
           reaffirms its dedication to providing a 100% free system to
           our users according to our Social Contract and the DFSG;
           and
         </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>
           encourages authors of all works to make those works
           available not only under licenses that permit modification,
           but also in forms that make such modifications practical;
           and
         </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>
           supports the decision of the Release Team to require works
           such as images, video, and fonts to be licensed in
           compliance with the DFSG without requiring source code for
           these works under DFSG #2; and
         </p>
       </li>
       <li>
         <p>
              determines that as a special exception to DFSG #2, the
              source code for device firmwares contained in the kernel
              packages will not be required as long as there are no
              other technical means to install and run the Debian
              system on these devices.
         </p>
       </li>
    </ol>

    <vmindiscuss />
    <p>
     As per <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2006/10/msg00024.html">
     the request from the Debian Project Leader</a>, The voting and     
     discussion periods are one week long.
    </p>

    <vquorum />
     <p>
        With the current list of <a href="vote_007_quorum.log">voting
          developers</a>, we have:
     </p>
    <pre>
#include 'vote_007_quorum.txt'
    </pre>
#include 'vote_007_quorum.inc'

    <vstatistics />
    <p>
      For this GR, as always 
      <a id="suppl_007_stats">statistics</a>
      shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements
      sent periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the
      list of
      <a id="vote_007_voters.txt">voters</a>
      would be made publicly available. Also, the
      <a id="vote_007_tally.txt">tally sheet</a>
      may also be viewed after to voting is done (Note that
      while the vote is in progress it is a dummy tally sheet).
    </p>

    <vmajorityreq />
    <p>
      Amendment A (choice 2) requires a 3:1 majority, since it creates
      a special exception to a foundation document.
    </p>
