<h2>How do I ran for DPL?</h2>
<h3>a) Introduction/Biography</h3>
<p>The Project Secretary suggested I divide this page into three sections. The
titles he suggested seemed good enough, so I might as well copy them verbatim.
This is the "Introduction/Biography" section where I tell you a little bit
about myself since some of you may not know me very well.</p>

<p>I was born in New Jersey, one of the many states making up the United States
of America. I came home, went to school, then joined the Debian Project.
Here is an illustration of my life history so far:<br />

<p>I am honored to be this year's half-joke candidate. "Why only half?" I hear
you asking. Well, for one, I don't have the humor potential to be a fully-joke
candidate. Additionally, if elected, I would only serve as half-DPL. There
is currently no provision in the Constitution for half-DPLs; if elected, I would
immediately and indefatigably ask for the commission of a panel to
investigate what to do with the other half of the DPL post.
If you don't agree with my platform, don't feel bad
about voting for me, since everyone forgets about the DPL platforms after the
election anyway.

<h3>b) Major Goal/ Meat of the platform,</h3>
<h4>Subsection Roman Numeral I<br />
	<small>In which I satirize Project Scud</small></h4>
<p>I'm pleased to introduce the formation of a joint leadership group,
code-named <b>Team Ari: Debian Police</b>. The current membership is a secret,
but Zeke the cat has allowed me to announce his participation. If I am elected,
these prestigious lifeforms will report back to me about their respective areas
of expertise to help me more eloquently do my job as DPL.<br />
As you can tell from the following bitmap-to-vector-to-bitmap image, Zeke is
thrilled to be part of Team Ari.<br />

<h4>Subsection Deux<br />
	<small>Where I talk about the issues</small></h4>
<p>There has been some concern in recent months about a number of issues which
affect the very foundation of Debian and its plans for world domination. Some
of the prominent issues have been:
<ul>
	<li>Canonical Launchpad licensing</li>
	<li>OpenSolaris and Nexenta licensing</li>
	<li>The GNU Free Documentation License</li>
	<li>The GNU General Public License, version 3</li>
	<li>The distribution terms of debian-private (licensing?)</li>
	<li>Inappropriate e-mails to public announcement lists (license to
	killfile)</li>
</ul>
<p>
Frankly, it seems like we're paying way too much attention to this whole
"license" thing. I mean, who needs such complicated licenses, anyway? I propose
that all software in Debian be relicensed under similar terms to my popular
<i>Gnocchi</i> software, which has the following copyright notice:
<samp>
	<tt># &copy; 2006 Ari Pollak</tt><br />
	<tt># You may not look at this program.</tt></blockquote>
</samp>
</p>

<p>Also, we should remove all pictures taken by cameras with
non-free firmware from the Debian Project. Except the pictures used on this
page.</p>
<br />

<p>Lastly, I'd like to introduce a new Debian GNU/Plan 9 port, code-named
<b>Snakes on a Plan 9</b>. Here's some advertising material to go along with
the new port:<br />

<h3>c) Rebuttal.</h3>
I liked this section so much that I decided to include it before I saw any of
the other candidates' platforms.
