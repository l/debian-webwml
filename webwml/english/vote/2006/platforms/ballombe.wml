<h1>Platform for Bill Allombert</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>

<P>I am 32 year-old and I have a Ph.D. in Pure Mathematics since 2001.
I am teaching and doing research in Mathematics at the University
of Montpellier, France.

<h2><A NAME="section_1">My involvement in Debian:</A></h2>

<P>I decided to join Debian because it is a successfull fully volunteer project,
and the political significance of that appealed to me, more than the
purely technical aspect. 

<P>I am Debian developer since June 2001. Initially I was involved in packaging
computer algebra systems, because I developed them or used them in my work.
Then I saw that a number of Debian-specific projects that I found important
were not maintained (menu and popularity-contest) so I decided to fix them
myself. Comparing their state in Woody and Sarge show that I have been 
successful. 

<P>I was also involved in improving the woody to sarge upgrade path, and
I am contributing to the Debian policy mailing-list.

<P>I am regularly participating to free software events in Europe,
the Libre software meeting, Solutions Linux and FOSDEM, so I have met
quite a number of you in real life. Unfortunately due to the uncertainty
of my life, I have missed several Debconf in a row, but I was at the
0th one. I was at FOSDEM this week-end.

<h2><A NAME="section_2">Why I have applied so late:</A></h2>

<P>To avoid people to believe I am controlled by a giant tamagoshi,
I will explain why I applied at the last moment.

<P>I was at FOSDEM this week-end, and someone told me that Lars Wirzenius (which
was also there) had denominated himself.  At this point, I was not comfortable
to vote for any of the remaining candidate, so I decided to take the matter in
my hands and nominated myself, when it was clear no one else was nominating
themself. However, I am not Lars, and I will not try to replace him.

<h2><A NAME="section_3">Debian</A></h2>

<P>In my opinion, the crucial point to have in mind when dealing with Debian
is that Debian is a fully volunteer project.

<P>This has several implications:

<OL>
  <LI>No one can be forced to do anything.
  <LI>You depend on the good will of the others volunteers.
  <LI>Volunteers perform better the task they are interested in.
  <LI>Volunteers resent bureaucracy as a waste of time.
  <LI>Responsibility came with autority.
  <LI>There should be no articial barrier to contributing.
</OL>
<h2><A NAME="section_4">Communications</A></h2>

<P>I will take the opportunuity to state some rules for better communications
from my experience:

<P>--- Be strict in what you send, liberal in what you accept.

<P>When writing emails e.g., be careful that you wrote in no offensive to people
etc. , but do not mind too much what other people write. Only the technical
detail are important. One way is to cool down in that case, is to read the
email and to wait 24 or 48 hour before replying.

<P>--- Respect other people feeling.

<P>Some developers have spent a lot of energy in some parts of the project
and are emotionnaly attached to them. They deserve some "protections".
If you break their feeling, it make no difference whether if your are
technically right or wrong, they will resent it and communication will be very
hard. Sometimes it is better to concede a point rather than breaking other
people feeling.

<P>--- What people can do by friendship, they will not do it by force.

<P>People can agree to follow some rules to be friendly with others. 
They can object to the exact same set of rules if they are imposed upon them.

<P>--- No one should ever feel obligated to reply to an email to a public forum 
(because one feel it is very inacurate, deficient, inappropriate, etc.).

<P>In most case, the people reading the forum will reach the same conclusion
about the deficiency, so there no point adding to the confusion and escalading
the issue.  Most of the time people writing 'Sorry, I <em>had</em> to reply' would
have better ignored the post completly.

<P>Whether or not I am elected, if you agree with these rules, please try to
follow them!

<h2><A NAME="section_5">How I see the DPL task.</A></h2>

<P>In my opinion, the most important task of the DPL is to mediate between the
developers. Some one most developers would be confident to appealing to in case
of disagreement who would give at least a kind answer if nothing else can be
done. 

<P>However there are lots other task to perform that must no be forgotten
(coordinating, representing the project to the ouside, relation with
Debian based distribution), but some of them can be delegated.

<h2><A NAME="section_6">My projects</A></h2>

<h2><A NAME="section_7">1 Thinking globally.</A></h2>

<P>One of the problem of Debian is that too few developers consider the
distribution globally rather than a collection of packages.  For example, a
package can be perfect by itself, but not fitting well with the rest of the
distribution. 

<P>One reason is that working locally need much less coordination
and is easier. Working globally usually require support from a lot
of other people.

<P>However thinking globally is very important to ensure the quality of
the distribution and the coherence of the project.

<h2><A NAME="section_8">2 Promoting "assistant" projects.</A></h2>

<P>I would like to promote projects that are partially identical major Debian
functions without duplicating/overstepping them. They are a great way to
learn how to perform the function and to eventually get trusted to perform the
major one. For example the Debian Testing Security team performs a similar job
to the Debian security team, and the debian-volative team do an
archive-management kind of job. We could have similar project for Debian system
admin, port handling, etc. 

<h2><A NAME="section_9">3 Taking care of Debian-specific projects.</A></h2>

<P>A lot of what have made Debian the leading edge is Debian-specific projects.
Unfortunately such projects tend to get unmaintained over time, and this is
a major issue. 

<P>As DPL, I would strive to ensure such project keep a minimal level of
support.

<h2><A NAME="section_10">4 Observers</A></h2>

<P>The idea is to have neutral people regularly reporting about some task of
Debian they are not involved with, trying to keep a neutral view.  

<P>The idea is that neutral observers do not suffer from the pressure of
performing the task so can more easily (and less emotionnaly) describe what is
going on, and they can be chosen for their interest and skill at reporting
rather than their interest and skill at performing the task, which can be very
different.

<P>This could reduce the frustration of waiting for some task to complete, warn
about tasks being without anyone anymore to fullfill them, etc.

<P>I think this is an idea worth experimenting that could improve transparency.

<h2><A NAME="section_11">Why should you vote for me</A></h2>

<ul>
<li>I am very patient. I can wait a long time to fix a problem if this is
 necessary to fix it <EM>correctly</EM>.</li>

<li>I am independent, so I will be able to represent all the developers.</li>

<li>I am good at thinking globally.</li>

<li>I have small goals but I reach them.</li>

<li>I am willing delegate task I am not well-suited to perform.</li>

<li>I am much better at reporting RC bugs than at fixing them, so you have
   better keeping me busy.</li>
</ul>

<P>Thanks a lot to have read so far, and do not forget to cast your vote!

<P>Friendly,<BR>
