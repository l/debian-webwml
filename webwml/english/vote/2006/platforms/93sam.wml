<h1>Steve McIntyre's DPL platform</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
I've been a Debian Developer since October 1996. I originally joined
to maintain the Debian version of mikmod; I was the upstream developer
at the time, and wanted the Debian version to work well too. In those
days, the NM process was rather simpler than today: I installed
Debian, then two days later I mailed Bruce Perens with a PGP key and
asked him for a Debian login. He responded almost immediately with
account details - I was in!
</p>

<p>
Since that point, I've worked on quite a wide range of packages, some
large and some small. Probably the most noticeable work I've done for
Debian is within the debian-cd team, both developing the debian-cd
software itself and using that same software to create the official
CDs (and now DVDs) that accompany each Debian release. I've been
involved with the CDs for almost every major and point release since
Hamm.
</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>Most of the things I'd like to see changed/improved in Debian are
well known problems - they are issues that have affected us for a long
time. I've separated them into two areas here: social issues and
professionalism, even if there is quite a broad overlap in some of the
cases.</p>

<h3>Social issues</h3>

<h4>Communications within the project</h4>

<p>This is a long-term bugbear; DPL candidates have been promising to
work on improving communication within the project for as long as I
can remember. There are several places where communication has been
problematic in the past. Sometimes DPL effort has helped to fix
things, but more often there has been no visible improvement.</p>

<p>Simple, regular status updates from the various teams within the
project can help a great deal here. Equally, regular reports from the
DPL are needed to make sure that the Debian community are aware of
what is being said and done on their behalf. Even if some of these
reports consist purely of "Sorry, I've been busy in real life and not
accomplished much", simple confirmation that posts are not sitting
unattended is better than nothing. I aim to encourage these updates,
and if elected I will commit to distributing regular news from the
DPL.</p>

<h4>Mailing lists and IRC</h4>

<p>Recent events suggest that we should learn a lesson from Ubuntu
with their code of conduct. Free Speech is an ideal that many of us
within Debian hold dear, but the negative, abusive language that often
appears on the development mailing lists and IRC channels is
<strong>not</strong> productive. Because of this, many people within
and outside the project are becoming leery of contributing to our
technical discussions. This hurts us both directly and indirectly:
public perception of the project can suffer when our external contacts
are unfriendly.</p>

<p>We need to <strong>agree</strong> a Debian code of conduct and then
also to <strong>abide</strong> by it. We already have the beginnings
of such a document, and I'd like to help develop it and encourage
other developers to adopt it.</p>

<h4>Training and NM</h4>

<p>Currently the NM process contains detailed tests of an applicant's
technical abilities, and of course this is a good and useful thing to
do. Unfortunately, we don't select for social skills; we need to work
together as a community!</p>

<p>NMs are often asked to show their skills by constructing a new
package and/or taking over an orphaned package. This can be good for
testing packaging skills, but can lead to NMs working on packages in
which they have no real interest - further down the line these are
most likely to be the packages that are abandoned.</p>

<p>I'd like to suggest that more NM training can/should happen more
within teams. We have a large number of packages where the maintainers
could do with help, and a large number of NMs looking for jobs to
do. I believe this is a great place where we can improve. We need some
sympathetic maintainers to make this work - they will be responsible
for the work done, and then will be expected to report to the relevant
AMs. I have already volunteered some of my own packages towards this
effort, and I'd like to encourage other DDs to do the same.</p>

<h4>Openness within the project</h4>

<p>We promise to be as open as possible, but we often fail on this
front. Sometimes this is necessary (e.g. when discussing embargoed
security updates), but much of the time it is not. Sometimes
discussions are private when they do not need to be, and this is not
good for us. Sometimes technical work is done within our various teams
and when this work is presented to a wider audience "cabal"
accusations are made.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no magic way to improve this situation. I
believe a major blocker here is the aggressive attitudes that are
often shown in our development forums, and these need to be curtailed
first. Once we have a healthier atmosphere for discussion, then more
open discussion will happen naturally.</p>

<h3>Professionalism</h3>

<h4>Technical standards</h4>

<p>In our large repository of software, we have a very large number of
packages and a very large number of maintainers. Most of the work in
Debian is done very well, but unfortunately not all of it. Much has
been said in the past about our developers being volunteers who cannot
be forced to do work that they don't want to. That may excuse people
working slowly on their packages, but it does <strong>not</strong>
excuse some of the sloppiness that happens from time to
time, for example packages that fail to build on a clean system.</p>

<p>We have a growing number of tools that a maintainer can use to check
the quality of their packages (linda, lintian and now piuparts). We
have build tools that can reduce the chance of broken dependencies and
other build-time issues (sbuild, pbuilder, etc.). Yet we still
regularly have broken or low-quality packages uploaded.</p>

<p>There are two issues here, as far as I can see. Some of our
maintainers are not aware of updates that have happened to our tools
and procedures. Some of us don't feel the need to use those newer
tools and methods. Both these issues should be fixable: more
documentation on best-practice packaging and testing methods will
help, both in describing what's available and why they're good.</p>

<h4>Working effectively; asking for help</h4>

<p>Continuing on from the previous point: another part of the DD's job
is to work effectively, both on our individual packages and within the
project as a whole. This includes simple things like handling the bugs
in our packages in a timely fashion, but also includes bigger things,
such as considering the impact of changes on the release
schedule. Working effectively is not just important for our own
gratification; it also makes a major impact on how long we take to
release and the experience our users have with using Debian.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a key part of working effectively is honesty. We can
all suffer from a lack of time to do the jobs that we've promised to
do. After all, real life has a nasty habit of intruding on our
so-called "spare" time. So long as we don't let things delay too far,
we can cope and still contribute. But at some point, we need to be
more honest with ourselves and actually admit that we can't continue
with the jobs that we've promised to do. It's a hard thing to do, but
in a friendly community where we're all working together towards a
common goal there should be <strong>no</strong> shame in asking for
help.</p>

<p>In a larger scope, procedures exist for DDs to temporarily leave
the project if real life has overtaken them, and re-join when the
situation changes. Again, there is no shame in doing this - we should
be happy to acknowledge all the contributions that people have made to
Free Software when they could. But, still, many people don't take this
route and instead simply become missing in action (MIA). It can take
quite a while to pick up on DDs who have simply dropped out of the
project. I have heard several suggestions on how we can detect them
more quickly and more easily, and I wish to support this.</p>

<h2>Why vote for me?</h2>

<p>We have a large field of candidates this year, which may make it
difficult for our developers to decide how to vote. I believe I can do
a good job as DPL due to the following qualities:</p>

<ul>

<li><strong>Experience:</strong> I've been a developer within Debian
for nearly ten years now. I've done large amounts of packaging work,
I've seen Debian evolve a great deal in that time, and I've been
involved in lots of different discussions.</li>

<li><strong>Organisation:</strong> Besides packaging, I've done a lot
of promotional work for Debian. I've organised Debian stands at lots
of shows and expos over the years, and I run the debian-uk mailing
list. Both of these help raise awareness of Debian and its goals. I'm
also currently the treasurer of the Debian UK Society. I've had a fair
experience at "cat-herding" so far, including arranging travel for
groups to Debconf, FOSDEM and other events.</li>

<li><strong>Social:</strong> I'm a programmer, which means I have
strong opinions on many subjects. (*grin*). Despite that, I believe I
am generally approachable and easy to work with. I am a good
communicator and negotiator, and I have made many friends in the
Debian and wider Free Software Community over the last few years.

</ul>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I have touched on some issues here that are hopefully not
surprising to most of our community. I must also acknowledge the fact
that the DPL does not have the power to simply impose changes as
he/she sees fit. The best that the DPL can do here is to encourage us
to improve, sometimes by discussion and debate and sometimes by
leading by example. I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe I can
help us to achieve some of the social and professional goals I have
listed here. My own priority would be to fix some of the social issues
first, as these are most pressing and in my opinion the most likely to
cause long-term damage to the project.</p>

<p>Thanks for your time in reading my platform.</p>
