<h2>
1 - Introduction
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
<em>&quot;The future of Debian: purpose-driven and predictable&quot;</em>
</p>

<p>
With this motto, I would like to complement last year's aim: <em>&quot;The
overall goal is to make Debian a fun and rewarding context to work and spend
time in.  So much so, that one misses and longs for it when one can't be or
work in it&quot;</em>.  This aim remains the same.
</p>

<p>
I am 35 years old, am married and we have two children.  I have been a Debian
Developer since 2000 and have worked professionally with Linux (and later
Debian) since 1996.  Many of you may also know me from serving as part of last
year's DPL Team or from the numerous Debian conferences that I helped organize.
</p>

<p>
In summary, I am running for the office of Debian Project Leader because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
I have collected considerable experience in how to organize Debian from a
leadship role during the last term and believe that it is vital for Debian to
carry this experience over to the next term.
</li>
<li>
I believe that Debian needs some changes in how it works (even on a social
level) and I have experience in implementing change in volunteer driven
scenarios.
</li>
<li>
I have experience with leadership in real-life volunteer/FOSS projects.
</li>
<li>
When necessary, I will be able to serve as DPL full-time.
</li>
<li>
I have an excellent track record of organization.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
2 - What I want to achieve
</h2>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-aims-old"></a>2.1 Last year's aims</h3>

<p>
The goals I formulated last year remain valid and relevant for the next term.
Allow me to quickly list them again:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
having more frequent real-life meetings.  For example, DebConfs, bug-squashing
parties and development/hack meetings.  An example includes the meeting
sponsored by the Region of Extremadura this year.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
promoting lots of small teams all over the project, in which people work
together, communicate and help, integrate and train NMs.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
having a more friendly and helpful environment on mailing lists and IRC
channels.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
making people aware of their leadership role in the project.  and encouraging
them to accept it more consciously and confidently
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
having more frequent and regular releases.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Some progress has been made on these goals during the last year.  The most
noticable might have been the Extremadura work meetings, which are now under
way.  Another major improvement occured in Debian's security team, which now
has started to work in a team-oriented, more transparent fashion, and is now
more open to help from newcomers than previously.
</p>

<p>
A lot of work has been performed by the existing core teams, but it hasn't been
easy to see from people not directly involved in the team.  As DPL I will lead
this work further, which leaves us with more transparent, dynamic and
communicative core teams.  I regard this as a prerequisite for the upcoming
release and would like to see it taken forward in good time before etch.
</p>

<p>
The mentors.debian.net and sponsors.debian.net project are in the process of
being integrated and improved.  This will allow others and potential NMs to
contribute to Debian in a much easier way.
</p>

<p>
The initial delay of Sarge hurt Debian's reputation as a distribution.  We have
a good, realistic timetable for the release of Etch, and this should be made a
priority, as well as ensuring the timely release of Etch+1.
</p>

<hr>

<h3><a name="s-aims-new"></a>2.2 Futher goals</h3>

<p>
My additional goals this year, which I will pursue are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Debian needs to care more about its contributors.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Help to allocate resources for Debian.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Help Debian to work more purpose-driven.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Debian is a growing project, but often its growth is limited by availability of
resources.  Making more resources available will help developers be more
productive in reaching their goals, and improve Debian overall.
</p>

<h2>
3 - How I want to achieve it: The DPL Team, second take
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Having worked on the DPL Team during 2005 I know how time consuming and, at
times, even draining it is for an individual.  Despite this, I am convinced
that a DPL Team is the way for the project to move forward.  I have witnessed
how much potential it holds when like minded people work closely together and
provide feedback to each other.  This ability for people to 'bounce ideas off
each other' is invaluable, and I believe is the very foundation of what makes
Debian what it is.
</p>

<p>
I am also certain that Debian has grown beyond the size where a single person
can appreciate and follow all the important ongoing issues, form an opinion on
them, and act accordingly.  People who state this underestimate the task and
are bound to fail.
</p>

<p>
During the campaining period, I will present
the members of this year's DPL team and what areas they will focus on.
Currently Andreas Barth and Steve Langasek have agreed to serve as contacts to
the release team and will take special care to see etch happen in time.  Neil
McGovern will work on the team as the contact to the security team.  We are
actively looking for someone acting as Community contact. [<a href="#f1" name="fr1">1</a>]
</p>

<h2>
4 - Debian helping its Developers
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
Many positions in Debian offer services to the rest of the project (e.g.
Alioth, the keyring maintainer, the NM process, the FTP Team etc).
Some of these do just fine and interact very well (and friendly) with the rest
of the project.  It would benefit the project as a whole to use these examples
as a first step towards a more communicative system, and following, a higher
regard and appreciation for those who volunteer and perform these roles. This
would also lead to a more friendly, and productive relationship between
developers who require help from these teams, and those within it.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
5 - Resource Allocation
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
A talent that I hold is to help people to allocate resources for their work.  I
want to bring this skill to the role of DPL.
</p>

<p>
Resources that can help people to work on Debian:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Work/hack meetings
</li>
<li>
Bandwidth offerings
</li>
<li>
Travel cost support
</li>
<li>
Hardware offerings
</li>
<li>
Hosting/Server offerings
</li>
</ul>

<p>
An attempt to raise some money from the community in a continuous and fun way
should be investigated.  Some work has already occured:
http://wiki.debian.org/FriendsOfDebian.
</p>

<h2>
6 - Debian Becoming More Purpose-Driven
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
One of the major achievements of the Debian community is the way that some
groups (e.g.  the release team and d-i) formulate and pursue goals.  This
example of purpose-driven work helps the co-operation in and between teams,
since it both formulates and communicates goals and also focuses energy and
time.  It also gives a strong feeling of achievement once a set goal is reached.
As DPL I will encourage teams to do likewise and will support them in setting
and reaching their goals.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
7 - Milestones
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
I know that many people just want to know for good reasons what happens inside
Debian and the DPL team, and what should be achieved by certain dates.  For this
reason, I will set up a list of target milestones and the DPL report will
include what worked well and what didn't.  These milestones will be maintained
at http://wiki.debian.org/DPLTeamMilestones
</p>

<hr>

<h2>
8 - Why vote for me?
</h2>

<hr>

<p>
I will make it more fun and rewarding to work on Debian.  I have leadership
experience, and an excellent team to help me (and I trust the team enough that
I won't block them from working).  If necessary, I can work full-time as DPL.
Vote for me, and Debian will become a better place.
</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>

<p>
<em><a name='f1' href='#fr1'>1</a></em>
</p>
<p>
To organize the team I would apply very similar rules as last year:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
DPL is chairman of the DPL-team.
</li>
<li>
DPL remains formally responsible for all decisions.
</li>
<li>
Whenever possible, tasks are delegated to the most appropriate team member.
</li>
<li>
Important and/or controversial decisions are made in discussion with the whole
team.
</li>
<li>
The team meets regularly (monthly) in an open irc channel, to discuss progress,
new issues and review ongoing tasks.
</li>
<li>
It is a real team.  Each member can represent it and communicate the team's
viewpoint above personal viewpoints.
</li>
<li>
Minutes/logs of the meetings are made available.
</li>
<li>
Although proven helpful, a private irc channel for venting and private issues
should be kept to a minimum.
</li>
<li>
Most normal exchange and discussion should take place in the open irc channel.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
A key issue to the success of the team is the &quot;active delegation&quot;.  I
feel this has been under-utilized during the last term and left the rest of the
team decapitated when the DPL was not at hand.  For a proper, formally
empowered DPL Team, the constitution would need to be changed.  I would pursue
that course if the team seems to work well.
</p>
