  <h1>Platform for Ted Walther</h1>

  <h2>LISTEN TO THE VOICE OF YOUR CONSCIENCE</h2>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">I am no stranger to controversy. Almost
  everyone in Debian knows I am not afraid to speak my mind and stick to an
  unpopular position, if I believe it is the right one. I am your conscience.
  I say the things you don't dare to. That is why you need me to represent
  your interests. Because I will, without letting small personality issues
  get in the way of the more important integrity and user friendliness of the
  project.</p>

  <p style="margin-top: 0;">Debian is a large, well-established project. It
  isn't moving fast, but it is moving, like an elephant through the
  underbrush. You can hear the twigs cracking, and the leaves whispering as
  it rushes down upon you. Do you have the guts to herd it into the corral
  and tame it? <span style="color: #F1F1F1">splash the mermaid</span></p>

  <p>After ten years, I am still usin
g Debian as my developement, server, and
  multimedia desktop platform. It is the best Linux developers platform in
  the world. It is also an excellent server platform. Alas, I can't say that
  about the Desktop. When a close relative got frustrated with virii on her
  Windows boxes, I chose to put Ubuntu on it. I didn't have time to hunt down
  a dozen different install and netinst cdroms, which may or may not be
  current, and may or may not work. I didn't have time to spend days
  configuring audio, printing, and X windows, and the rest of the desktop for
  her. <span style="color: #F1F1F1">organic watermelon</span></p>

  <p>Are we going to take that lying down? Is that where we want Debian to
  go?</p>

  <h2>UBUNTU</h2>

  <p>Some people have complained about Ubuntu. I think they are off their
  rocker. My relative is computer illiterate, yet she is happy as a duck
  using Ubuntu for web, email, and listening to her MP3 collection. When I
  tried switching another computer illiterate friend over to Debian to do the
  same tasks, he kept having problems and draining my time. <span style=

  <p>Debian is a volunteer project. Many of us joined it and are working on
  it out of love. We do what we want; there are no deadlines or bosses. And
  that is how it should stay. But some of the work of putting out a GNU/Linux
  distribution is not fun, and few people want to do it for free. When
  projects like Ubuntu and Progeny come along and pay people to do the boring
  parts of the work, we should be ecstatic. We should be leaping and dancing
  in the streets. Hey, they're contributing! Great! We can fold their work
  back in to our distribution and carry on, stronger than ever. <span style=
  "color: #F1F1F1">Strawberries</span></p>

  <h2>SOCIAL SKILLS</h2>

  <p>It takes a special kind of person to get into Free Software. Usually
  they are broken and messed up in some way. Who in their right mind would
  write quality software and just give it away? Most of us are disfunctional
  in various ways. Some more-so than others. Aspergers syndrome is more
  common among Linux zealots than it is among your typical bread and butter
  working class Windows programmer. <span style="color: #F1F1F1">asterisk

  <p>Knowing this about ourselves, we should show more tolerance for each
  other. Maybe someone didn't say something in the most back-scratching and
  warm-fuzzy of terms. Maybe someone wasn't sensitive. We communicate mostly
  over email and IRC. These text mediums strip out almost 90% of the context
  information we use in face to face communication. Being quick assume an
  insult was intended is corrosive to our project, yet I see it happening
  continually. <span style="color: #F1F1F1">fnord</span></p>

  <p>Some Debian Developers have made a habit of complaining about the social
  skills of other developers, to the point of trying to get them kicked out
  through use of our General Resolution mechanism. I see such behavior as far
  more harmful and divisive to the project than the occasional salty joke,
  risque image, or even outright insensitivity. When elected, I will put
  forward a General Resolution to the effect that, if a person tries to get
  another person kicked out of the Debian project, and they fail, they
  themselves will be kicked out. <span style="color: #F1F1F1">wiki</span></p>

  <p>I am in Debian to change the world for the better, and have fun while
  doing it. If you aren't in it for those reasons, then you are part of the
  problem in Debian. There are too many sticks up too many butts. Try
  relaxing once in a while. Sure, we are making history. Sure, historians
  will be examining our email archives hundreds, thousands of years from now.
  Do you want those long distant scholars to report to their peers "Debian
  could have been interesting, but was ultimately done in by its own sense of
  self-importance and reluctance to take risks"? <span style=
  "color: #F1F1F1">blog</span></p>

  <p>For the record, Andrew Suffield's <a href=
  "http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00009.html">post
  to debian-devel-announce</a> was hilarious. He made his point in a way that
  everyone could appreciate. Call me a Dinosaur, but that is the kind of
  spunk we need in this project. If you can't laugh at yourself, you have no
  business laughing at others. However, I disagree with Andrew's point; the
  post about Debian/Ubuntu collaboration <a href=
  "http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2006/01/msg00008.html">he
  objected to</a> was appropriate and useful to the Debian group at large. I
  am grateful to Raphael Hertzog for having written it. <span style=

  <h2>A FAIR NEW MAINTAINER PROCESS</h2>

  <p>Debians current New Maintainer process, which determines who can be a
  Debian Developer and who cannot, has evolved over a long period of time. I
  am a Dinosaur, from the days before we even had a New Maintainer process.
  All it took was getting your PGP key signed by another Debian Developer or
  two, then waiting for Martin Schulze phone you up from overseas and ask if
  you were "moral enough" to join the Debian project. Then you had to wait
  six months (or less) for James Troup to find enough time to add you to the
  official Debian Keyring and create your email account. <span style=
  "color: #F1F1F1">Gnome</span></p>

  <p>I'm not the only one who never went through the New Maintainer process
  as it exists. In fairness to the majority of developers today who did come
  into the project through the NM (New Maintainer) process, I will put
  forward a GR (General Resolution) when elected. The GR will require all
  current developers who didn't go through NM to go through it within the
  next year. From that point on, every developer would be required to renew
  their membership every three years, similar to drivers licenses. For people
  who are already developers, with keys in the keyring and packages in the
  archives, the process wouldn't be too intrusive. <span style=
  "color: #F1F1F1">Creative Commons</span></p>

  <p>Many people are getting stuck in the New Maintainer process, or are
  passing through it, and then not being added in as developers very quickly.
  Even worse, a few are repeatedly asked to restart the process all over
  again. This has had the benefit that only people who were truly committed
  to Debian achieved membership as developers, but has also contributed to
  making Debian appear impossible to contribute to. It may be worth examining
  the root causes. Is the delay in the process deliberate, or is James Troup
  run off his feet? Should we hire him some attractive young personal
  assistants? Is there anything he needs to delegate to others? We should
  spare no expense to make sure he has all the resources he needs,
  considering the important job he is doing for the project. <span style=

  <h2>A STATUE FOR JAMES TROUP</h2>

  <p>For many years James Troup has been the gatekeeper of the Debian
  project, managing our download servers and adding in every new developer to
  the database by hand after they pass through our New Maintainer hazing
  procedure. As DPL I would solicit opinions on the best way Debian can honor
  him for his long years of service to the project. I'd recommend a life-size
  statue on the grounds of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. <span style=

  <h2>REBUTTALS</h2>

  <p>Nothing to rebut.  See you at the polls.</p>
