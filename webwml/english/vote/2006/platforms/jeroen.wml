<h1>Platform for Jeroen van Wolffelaar</h1>

My name is Jeroen van Wolffelaar, currently 24 years of age. I'm a <a
href="http://www.cs.uu.nl">computer
science student</a> at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. I have had one year
of full-time experience as a board member of my study association, <a
href="http://www.a-eskwadraat.nl">A-Eskwadraat</a>. I'm an active
contributor to Debian since roughly end of 2003, and am a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint/2005/01/msg00003.html">Debian
Developer since the last day of 2004</a>. I've been involved in QA
(lintian, MIA, other areas), and <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00142.html">have
been an ftp-team member for about a year now</a>.

<a name="why"></a>
<h2>Why I am running for DPL, and how I intend to organise that</h2>

<p>While I actually prefer to write code or maintain packages, or generally,
work on technical issues, I feel compelled to run for DPL this year. I like
the Debian project a lot: mostly because of its technical excellence, and
because it allows one to contribute to a free operating system together
with a lot of interesting and skilled people. However, I perceive some
problems in the project that I think should be addressed, and I want to
address those. Most of you will know that last year, I started the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html"><em>DPL
team</em></a> in December 2004, mainly because
<strong>I do feel a team would be better suited than an individual to
tackle the hard issues I felt that needed to be addressed. I seek to
continue this, but now as lead of such team.</strong>

<p>As a result of Branden getting elected last year, I was in the privileged
position to witness a large part of what is involved in being DPL. I
learned a lot during that year, and noticed things that did and didn't
work. As I explained in <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/03/msg00035.html">the
original DPL team announcement</a>, a great deal of inspiration for the setup of
the "Scud" team was coming from a quite different type of organisation. An
important thing I learned is that in order for such a team to work
effectively, it is required that the whole team is involved in (at least
informed of) all what's going on, and that an agenda is maintained and
enforced, and ensuring that assigned (delegated) tasks are fulfilled.
I do believe that the opportunities a DPL team offers were in retrospect not
fully leveraged. I intend to do better by ensuring, helped
by having experienced the past year of DPL team, that <strong>I will
involve the whole team in the DPL actions, and maintain the agenda of
things I want to do</strong>. I will ensure the agenda (based on things in
this platform and whatever else comes up) is followed, doing whatever is
not working well enough in the team myself.

<p> There is no team composed yet, developers interested in helping in
general or with one of the below areas specifically can email me privately.
I will publish the members of my proposed team in about two weeks, or at
the latest just before voting starts.

<p>I will have a public review of how the DPL and the DPL team itself is
performing four times, roughly every 3 months, consisting of an online
discussion, followed by a mail to debian-devel-announce summarising the
reflection and announcing possible changes in focus.

<a name="issues"></a>
<h2>Issues I will work on</h2>

Debian is a highly distributed and networked project. It excels where
people work together directly on technical problems they like to contribute
to. It is the nature of the Debian project, and in the ideal situation, the
DPL should not be involved at all.
However, there are a couple of problems in the project that require
addressing.

<p> They are all related to communication.

<a name="communication"></a>
<h3> Communication </h3>

Debian needs to focus on technical excellence with free software
In order to achieve that, have <strong>smooth communication</strong> both
within the project and from the project to the outside: to users, to
potential contributors, and not in the least to Debian developers.
A friendly and productive climate is very important, one that does not
prevent people from doing good work. Also externally communication is
important, both to enable users to leverage Debian to its fullest extent,
and for the general world via the media to hear about Debian.

<p> Because Debian Developers are by nature mostly technically interested,
communication can easily be something getting not enough attention. Below I
will outline what areas I'd like to see communication improved, and how
I intend to solve that.

<a name="among_DDs"></a>
<h4> Communication among Debian contributors</h4>

<p> The major issue we are faced with currently is that a lot of
time is wasted on unproductive mailing list discussions, keeping people from
doing real work, or worse, driving people away from our central lists. An
even more important problem with this situation is that it drives away
people from the Debian project as a whole, there are numerous examples of
people leaving Debian for this reason, or simply not joining. This needs to
improve. For a project like Debian, it is essential to have a list like
debian-devel with the vast majority of the regular contributors on it,
rather than the current situation of having too regular Debian contributors
not being subscribed due to the state of the list.

<p> <strong>I will push for the adoption of a code of conduct</strong>.
I do feel strongly about that mailing lists should be able to provide a
forum for productive technical discussion, where one can ask questions to
and get a reasonable result. If some people are not able to contribute to
this, but rather hurt the discussion, action must be undertaken. If peer
pressure does not help, this may include such things like posting delays,
moderation of certain individuals, and in extreme cases, banning from
mailing lists. I will work with the listmaster team to see whether they are
willing to facilitate this, or whether there needs to be a new team of
people performing this moderation.

<p> I will also continue to look into other means to structure discussion,
see for example <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/12/msg01100.html">my
initiative to hold informal polls to gauge developer opinion</a>.

<a name="towards_contributors"></a>
<h4> Communication towards Debian contributors </h4>

<p> Above all, contributing to Debian should be fun and encouraging.
Therefore, I will make a bi-weekly pick of some interesting bit of Debian
that I feel is worthy of attention, and invite someone to write a short
article about it, and post it to a general mailing list, or I will myself
write a piece. With those "insider reports", I hope that the Debian
contributors are more aware of some of the many things that are happening
inside the project, and create more awareness of the amount of interesting
things inside the project.

<a name="towards_users"></a>
<h4> Communication to our users </h4>

<p>Debian does have a lot of users, a lot of which are in need of assistance
at some point. Support needs to be accessible, and friendly. Any type of
question needs to be able to be asked without meeting hostility. I will
continue giving attention to this.

<p>I will encourage more use of <a href="http://wiki.debian.org">the
official wiki</a>, look into ways to ensure the <tt>#debian</tt> IRC
channel is a nice place to get help. I will also investigate whether some
sort of forums like <a href="http://forums.debian.net">forums.debian.net</a>,
which I started a while ago, could become an official project resource as
an addition to the current offerings, specifically targeted for starting
Debian users.

<a name="infrastructure"></a>
<h4> Increase transparency of infrastructure teams </h4>

<p> There are (perceived or real) problems in communicating with some
infrastructure teams at times. Also, the way they function is often not
really accessible. This is understandable from the team's point of view,
because documenting is often boring. I will work on having infrastructure
teams' tasks and way of working documented better (on www.debian.org), and
I will work together with those teams to ensure the preferred way of
contact is responsive, and/or there's at least another mailing list where
people can ask questions and get possibly helped by interested third
parties &mdash; an example is the debian-security mailing list, where anyone
can ask a question, and also non-security-team members can help out in cases
where a question doesn't require a team member to be answered.

<a name="mediator"></a>
<h4> Act as a mediator/ombudsman </h4>

As with all places where humans work together, people can get disagreements
with each other. Sometimes this can heat up so much so that it hurts
mutual cooperation, which is a bad thing. Whenever I notice this, or
such a situation is brought to my attention, I will find the best person I
can think of (possibly myself) to act as a mediator. We have the technical
committee for technical disagreements, but nothing similar for social
disagreements. I will investigate setting up a team like the tech-ctte for
this.

<a name="media"></a>
<h4> More visibility in the media </h4>

Debian doesn't play itself in the news very often, while there are a lot of
interesting things going on. <strong>I will actively approach the
press</strong>, and I will be working together with the our press contact
to initiate more visibility in the media. I will try to increase my
attendance of various conferences and gatherings, and solicit invitations
to come talk about Debian at such gathering.

<a name="nonissues"></a>
<h2>Things I will leave alone</h2>

A lot of areas in Debian are running smoothly at the moment. I will not
intervene when things are running well. I have good faith in our release
team's plan to release Etch by the end of this year, the technical
committee is doing fine, and so is our project secretary.


<a name="whyme"></a>
<h2> Why choose me? </h2>

I enjoy working on Debian, and I would like work with a lot of people to
ensure working on Debian remains enjoyable, and becomes even more fun to
do. I'm a team player, and will seek actively and often for advice and
discussion how to achieve this goal best. Together with you all, I hope to
make my DPL-ship an enjoyable experience for the project and myself.
