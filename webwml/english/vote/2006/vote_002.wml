	  <vdebate />
            <p>
              Don Armstrong, David Nusinow, Thaddeus H. Black,
              Martin-&#201;ric Racine, and MJ Ray have agreed to be
              debate moderators.  I would like to extend the thanks of
              the project for their stellar work in conducting an
              excellently orchestrated debate, and a professionally
              rendered debate log. A <a href="suppl_002_debate">transcript</a>
              of the debate is available for review. 
	    </p>


          <vstatistics />
          <p> 
            This year, like always,  
             <a name="suppl_002_stats">some</a>
             <a href="http://master.debian.org/~srivasta/leader2006/">statistics</a>
             shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements sent
             periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the   
 
             <a name="vote_002_voters.txt">list of</a> <a
             href="http://master.debian.org/~srivasta/leader2006/voters.txt">voters</a>
             shall be recorded. Also, <a name="vote_002_tally.txt">the
             </a> <a
             href="http://master.debian.org/~srivasta/leader2006//tally.txt">tally
             sheet</a> would also be available to be viewed.  Please
             remember that the project leader election has a secret
             ballot, so the tally sheet is produced with the hash of
             the alias of the voter rather than the name; the alias
             having been sent to the corresponding voter when the
             acknowledgement of the ballot was sent so that people may
             verify that their votes are correct. While the voting is
             still open the tally is a dummy one; after the vote, the
             final tally sheet shall be put in place. Please note that
             for secret ballots the md5sum on the dummy tally sheet is
             randomly generated, as otherwise the dummy tally sheet
             would leak information relating the md5 hash and the
             voter.
         </p>


          <vquorum />
          <p>
	With <a href="vote_002.quorum.log">972 developers</a>,
	we have:
            <pre>
 Current Developer Count = 972
 Q ( sqrt(#devel) / 2 ) = 15.5884572681199
 K min(5, Q )           = 5
 Quorum  (3 x Q )       = 46.7653718043597


            </pre>


	  <vmajorityreq />
	  <p> All candidates would need a simple majority to be eligible.</p>


          <voutcome />
     	      <h3>To be decided</h3>
           <p>
              I would like to thank all the candidates for their
              service to the project, for standing for the post of
              project leader, and for offering the developers a strong
              and viable group of candidates.
           </p>

              <p>
               Debian uses the Condorcet method for votes.
               Simplistically, plain Condorcet's method
               can be stated like so : <br/>
               <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
                  The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
                  candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
                  race with that candidate.</q>
                The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
                be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
                and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
                various means of resolving the tie. See
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
                for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
                <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
                specifically, § A.6.
             </p>
