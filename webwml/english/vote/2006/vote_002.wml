	  <vdebate />
            <p>
              Don Armstrong, David Nusinow, Thaddeus H. Black,
              Martin-&#201;ric Racine, and MJ Ray have agreed to be
              debate moderators.  I would like to extend the thanks of
              the project for their stellar work in conducting an
              excellently orchestrated debate, and a professionally
              rendered debate log. A <a href="suppl_002_debate">transcript</a>
              of the debate is available for review. 
	    </p>


          <vstatistics />
          <p> 
            This year, like always, some 
             <a name="suppl_002_stats">statistics</a>
             shall be gathered about ballots received and acknowledgements sent
             periodically during the voting period.  Additionally, the   list of
 
             <a name="vote_002_voters.txt">voters</a>
             shall be recorded. Also, the 
             <a name="vote_002_tally.txt">tally
             sheet</a> would also be available to be viewed.
             Please remember that the project leader
             election has a secret ballot, so the tally sheet is
             produced with the hash of the alias of the voter rather
             than the name; the alias having been sent to the
             corresponding voter when the acknowledgement of the
             ballot was sent so that people may verify that their
             votes are correct.
         </p>


          <vquorum />
          <p>
	With <a href="vote_002.quorum.log">972 developers</a>,
	we have:
            <pre>
 Current Developer Count = 972
 Q ( sqrt(#devel) / 2 ) = 15.5884572681199
 K min(5, Q )           = 5
 Quorum  (3 x Q )       = 46.7653718043597


            </pre>


	  <vmajorityreq />
	  <p> All candidates would need a simple majority to be eligible.</p>


          <voutcome />
     	      <h3>To be decided</h3>
           <p>
              I would like to thank all the candidates for their
              service to the project, for standing for the post of
              project leader, and for offering the developers a strong
              and viable group of candidates.
           </p>

              <p>
               Debian uses the Condorcet method for votes.
               Simplistically, plain Condorcet's method
               can be stated like so : <br/>
               <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
                  The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
                  candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
                  race with that candidate.</q>
                The problem is that in complex elections, there may well
                be a circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C,
                and C beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use
                various means of resolving the tie. See
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a>
                for details. Debian's variation is spelled out in the
                <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the constitution</a>,
                specifically, § A.6.
             </p>
