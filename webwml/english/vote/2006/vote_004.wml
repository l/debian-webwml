    <h2>DFSG #2 applies to all programmatic works</h2>
    <h3>The Debian Project:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
         <p>
              Reaffirms that programmatic works distributed in the
              Debian system (IE, in main) must be 100% Free Software,
              regardless of whether the work is designed to run on the
              CPU, a subsidiary processing unit, or by some other form
              of execution. That is, works must include the form that
              the copyright holder or upstream developer would
              actually use for modification.
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
              Strongly recommends that all non-programmatic works
              distribute the form that the copyright holder or
              upstream developer would actually use for
              modification. Such forms need not be distributed in the
              orig.tar.gz (unless required by license) but should be
              made available on upstream websites and/or using Debian
              project resources.
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
              Reaffirms its continued support of users whose hardware
              (or software) requires works which are not freely
              licensed or whose source is not available by making such
              works available in non-free and providing project
              resources to the extent that Debian is capable of doing
              so.
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
              Requests that vendors of hardware, even those whose
              firmware is not loaded by the operating system, provide
              the prefered form for modification so that purchasers of
              their hardware can exercise their freedom to modify the
              functioning of their hardware.

    <h2>Release Etch even with kernel freeware issues</h2>

              We acknowledge that there is a lot of progress in the

              sorted out;
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
              We give priority to the timely release of Etch over
              sorting every bit out; for this reason, we will deliver
              firmware in udebs as long as it is necessary for
              installation (like all udebs), and firmware included in
              the kernel itself as part of Debian Etch, without
              further conditions.

    <h2>Special exception to DFSG #2 for firmware</h2>
    <h3>THE DEBIAN PROJECT</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
         <p>
              reaffirms its dedication to providing a 100% free system
              to our users according to our Social Contract and the
              DFSG; and
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
              encourages authors of all works to make those works
              available not only under licenses that permit
              modification, but also in forms that make such
              modifications practical; and
         </p>
      <li>
      <li>
         <p>
             supports the decision of the Release Team to require
             works such as images, video, and fonts to be licensed in
             compliance with the DFSG without requiring source code
             for these works under DFSG #2; and

              source code for device firmwares contained in the kernel
              packages will not be required as long as there are no
              other technical means to install and run the Debian
              system on these devices.

    <p>To Be determined</p>


    <p>
      Debian uses the Condorcet method for votes. 
      Simplistically, plain Condorcets method
      can be stated like so : <br />
      <q>Consider all possible two-way races between candidates.
        The Condorcet winner, if there is one, is the one
        candidate who can beat each other candidate in a two-way
        race with that candidate.</q>
      The problem is that in complex elections, there may well be a
      circular relations ship in which A beats B, B beats C, and C
      beats A. Most of the variations on Condorcet use various means
      of resolving the tie. See <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloneproof_Schwartz_Sequential_Dropping">Cloneproof
      Schwartz Sequential Dropping</a> for details. Debian's variation
      is spelled out in the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/constitution">the
      constitution</a>, specifically, A.6.
