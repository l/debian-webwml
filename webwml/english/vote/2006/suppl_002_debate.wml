<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; The first question which the candidates will have 6 minutes to respond to:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Why are you running for DPL this year?</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; I'm running for DPL this year because I think that's a good way to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; encourage Debian to prioritise the things listed in my platform: making</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; sure we're continually doing interesting stuff and that we're all aware</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; of it; making sure we keep new blood flowing through the project; and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; making sure we don't leave thinking about how we do things until this</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; time next year.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; I'm running for DPL this year because Debian has some serious problems that I'm in a better position to help solve as DPL, rather than as a private developer.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; I'm standing as DPL this year because I believe I can do a good job of leading Debian.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; I thought long and hard about standing last year, but left it too late. After the</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; election, several of my DD friends complained that I hadn't stood, as they wanted to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; vote for somebody they could trust. This year, I considered my options again and this</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; time I'm ready. I believe I can help improve Debian and make the project a more fun and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; productive place for all of us.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; was also there) had denominated himself.  At this point, I was not comfortable</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; to vote for any of the remaining candidate, so I decided to take the matter in</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; my hands and nominated myself, when it was clear no one else was nominating</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; to contribute my share to it. I like working on Debian, but at times, I</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; think communication could be much better. I'd like to work on those issues,</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; because we're a project of skilled people.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; I run for DPL this year because I would like to bring my talents of</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; good leadership, organisation and understanding of social groups to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; optimal use for Debian.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; I started working on DPL stuff last year already and would like to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; continue that during the next term, to carry over expertise and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; knowledge.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; Debian needs to change its culture to remain competitative and become</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; more purpose driven and friendly. I would like to help it doing that.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; With the DPL team that will support me in that I have very good</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; chances of accomplishing that.</li>

<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; second question, again 6 minutes:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Do you feel that being DPL would drastically alter the work you already</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; do for Debian? How?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (I've given the candidates an extra minute on this question, because I originally mentioned that I would send them the questions to -candidates)</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; As DPL, I'd have a bigger hat on, and be better able to help conflicting parties come to agreement.  Apart from the added work of speaking to groups and holding press conferences, there wouldn't be too much other change; I'm already a fairly political animal.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; No, my work would not change very much. During the last term I served</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; on the DPL team already and know how things work and have faced some</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; of the problems we are also going to face this coming term.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; I feel I am well prepared and ready for the task.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; I don't think that being DPL will _drastically_ alter the work I already do for Debian.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; It _will_ cause me to look for more help on some of the tasks I currently work on -</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; package maintenance and CD/DVD work, as I expect I may have less time to do those tasks</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; unadided. I still expect to be able to help on those tasks, regardless.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; I don't believe this would dramatically alter my work for Debian; rather that it</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; would allow me a bit more flexibility in achieving the goals I just mentioned and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; thus let me give them a higher priority than otherwise; so that instead of just</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; focussing on my niches, I could reasonably go to people and say "you're doing great</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; stuff that deserves to be announced (or better supported, or made more official, or</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; whatever)" and get that to happen -- and I think that sort of activity from the DPL and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; the Debian leadership in general is needed.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; No, I'm already working on Debian in general, and not limiting myself to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; just my packages. Amongst others by being part of the current DPL team, but</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; also by contributing to release management and infrastructural tasks.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; But, being DPL will allow me to work on some core parts of Debian I</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; wouldn't otherwise easily be able to do. I'd like to work on enabling</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; others to work well on Debian, by motivating them, and working on</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; problematic friction points in the project.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; I don't think this will conflict, rather, those tasks (DPL and non-DPL)</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; will complement eachother.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; It would. This would certainly be a new challenge for me</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; since my involvement in Debian has been limited in scope.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; However, I always have an eye on the distribution as a</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; whole instead as a collection of part. This is something</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; important for a DPL.</li>

<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; third question, again 6 minutes to respond:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; There have been two expulsion procedures started now. Do you think</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; they were inapropriate or do you think they are a reflection of real</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; problems in the project?</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; I don't think the options are mutually exclusive -- I tend to think</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; expulsion was inappropriate, and the fact that it's being considered</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; is a reflection of real problems in the project. I think it was inappropriate</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; because it's too heavy-handed: expulsion should be a last resort, made only</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; after other more moderate attempts have been made to ease the conflict and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; failed. I hope that over the next year we'll start exploring what ways work</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; and don't, so that we do have some alternatives other than "ignore the problem"</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; and "expel people until the problem stops".</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; I think the first expulsion procedure, against Andrew Suffield, was inappropriate.  Since Sven Luther</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; has threatened me with physical harm in the past, I don't feel unbiased enough to comment on whether</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; his expulsion procedure is appropriate.  However I would like to note that Sven Luther was quite vocally</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt;  in support of all the other expulsion procedures that were initiated in the past.  Is he getting his</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; just desserts?</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; The whole concept of removing developers by acclamation is inappropriate but</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; this is also a reflection of real problems in the project. The DPL has</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; not been very visible in the last months and the project has sufferred from a</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; While the expulsion procedure was designed to kick people out of the</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; project, it is extremly hard to do it with the current process since</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; it requires a degree of unity within the project that we did not have</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; in a long time.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; It is however a tool to express in a convincing and somewhat</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; threatening way "We really have a problem with the way you</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; behave. Think about it. Hard."··</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; Unfortunatly this tool is rather coarse and undifferentiated. We can</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; not yet say something like "We think you are a bully and would like</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; you to change, since we value you anyway."··</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; On the other hand, those people it was used on so far really had a</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; hard time to understand more sublime tones and criticism.··</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; To have SOME tool is however a good start.··</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; I think the debian community needs a way to communicate drastic</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; disapproval. The current expulsion process can in reality do only</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; that.  IF we want to work with formal processes we need both ways to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; express the degree of our disapproval better and also an effective way</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; to expell people from the project.··</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; It would be much better if our community managed to correct</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; behaviouristic missfits in a more immediatly and private manner</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; though, without bureaucratic means.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; The two expulsion were intended to remove disruptive people from</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; the project. It is important that Debian learns to handle those</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; cases in order to keep the working climate healthy and be able to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; focus on the work. I think both candiates needed such a strong</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; reminder that they should not cross the lines quite so often.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; The expulsions are clearly a sign of problems in the project. I don't believe</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; that they are necessarily inappropriate, but starting expulsion proceedings</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; should be considered a last resort.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; The two expulsions that have been raised are both for social issues, which saddens</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; Expulsion is a very harsh measure to take, or even to consider. The fact</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; that the process has been initiated twice is already a bad sign on itself.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; .</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; project, especially one with strict entrance measures, there should be a</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; way to also decide to reverse the entrance of someone if someone's</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; seriously harmful to the project, externally or internally. However,</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; mediation should really be happening beforehand, preferably with the DPL</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; should succeed. I was supportive of the first one, and don't know about the</li>

<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: Since every DPL for the last few years has failed to communicate regularly despite their best goodwill, do you think you'd do better?  If so,  how and why?</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; have questions, they can email them in.  Providing regular reports is the</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; secretaries job.  I think Manoj deserves a raise, because he has done a great</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; job as project secretary.  Also, Martin Schulze Debian Weekly News has filled in</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; any communications gap that a DPL would otherwise fill.  No need to reinvent the</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; Communicating regularly is very difficult, and not something that should</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; be underestimated. For me (eg, as release manager), the biggest problem</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; is finding something that I think is worth saying, because "No, we're not</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; ready to release yet for the same reasons as last time" isn't very fun, or</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; very motivating. I think the DPL has similar problems -- it's great to make</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; posts when exciting things get done, but when you're trying to solve difficult</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; ongoing problems, you often don't get that regularly.</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; .</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; So my main answer is twofold: first, that thanks to the wonders of blogging,</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+b|</b>&gt; there's plenty of opportunity to talk about things in a fun interesting way</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; even when they're not finished, or not important enough to warrant a mailing</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; list post; and second, I think communication should be something the entire</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; project does, so I'd rather focus on encouraging other developers to post interesting</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; tidbits regularly than worry about the DPL repeating DWN's job.</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; the gutting of the DPL office was being discussed and implemented.  Martin</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; enforcement required. I don't think any great encouragement</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; is needed -- if people want to do that, they already can, and</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+e|</b>&gt; usually already do. I'm happy to suggest ways of talking to</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+f|</b>&gt; people cooperatively if they want explanations of how things work,</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; Enforcing documentation of roles and timetables is a little hard - we're volunteers!</li>
<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+d|</b>&gt; But certainly each of the teams should be encouraged to do this; I've often found in</li>

<li class="n1"> &lt;<b>+c|</b>&gt; documentation, I will try and find people to help. If no help is forthcoming, I</li>

<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; vim. definitely.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: There are some open issues in Debian, like multiarch and non-free kernel modules that seem to  get bogged down due to the fact that there is no real consensus and thus neither proponents nor opponents manage to force the issue. Do you  feel a DPL should take a more active role in identifying or even setting the project standpoint and making sure it is implemented within a  reasonable timeframe?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Furthermore, how would you help this process to occur</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize SteveMcIntyre </li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; if the DPL has time, he should use his role to help the project arrive at a consensus.  But at the end of the day, it is the kernel team that will make those hard decisions.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; TedWalther: please don't respond unless you've been recognized.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; the DPL generally doesn't try to set technical policy, and I see that as a good thing</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; what is this, Roberts Rules of Order?</li>
<li class="meta"><em>-!- mode/#debian-dpl-debate [-v TedWalther] by don_armstrong</em></li><li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AnthonyTowns </li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; by all means calling on the dpl to try and push technical discussions will help</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; sorry, my bad.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; I don't think "forcing" the issue is a good thing, or having the DPL "set the project standpoint"; but having the DPL lead discussions, and try to make sure that the various options are clearly presented and refined is important,</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; as is making sure that we come to /some/ decision, even if that's "we don't know enough yet, let's investigate ____ ____ and ____ further, and then decide"</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize BillAllombert</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; Most of the time the issue is that there are several workable solutions. The DPL can play a role by gathering everybody opinion and lead them to a consensus solution. This is especially important if it involves non-DEbian entities.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; go ahead JeroenVW </li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; For an idea to get implemented, one or more people need to actually be willing to work on those isssues</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; if nobody is interested to put time in it, it won't work</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; however, the DPL can help working out what direction to take</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; and getting the right people to talk to eachother</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; or perhaps, suggest an interesing, previously unthought of, direction</li>
<li class="meta"><em>-!- mode/#debian-dpl-debate [+v TedWalther] by don_armstrong</em></li><li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; go ahead TedWalther </li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; If the DPL has time, he should use his role to help the project arrive</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; at a consensus.  But at the end of the day, it is the kernel team that</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; will make those hard decisions.  The most I can do as DPL is put</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; forward a GR to modify Policy, which the kernel team will then have to</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; follow.  Changing Policy is not trivial, even for a DPL.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; go ahead AndreasSchuldei </li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; The DPL is in this case just a normal developer, with a higher soap-box. People are more likely to listen to him and will perhaps decide to following his attempts of moderation.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; I would try to get people to talk about hard topics like these at DebConfs, for example, where there is time and plenty of bandwidth to do so and less chance of missunderstanding.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; Actually that is what happend at previous DebConfs, when Martin talked about kernel drivers and firmware during dinner, for example, and asked for more discussion and patientce with each other.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; ok, next question</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; What are your thoughts on the proposed code of conduct?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; hrm.. question is ill phrased apparently; lets replace it.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; recognize</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; or rather, lets continue, since people want to answer.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize JeroenVW </li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (sorry for being slightly discombobulated here)</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; There is a debian community guidelines in the works by Enrico Zini. However, this is not intended as Code of Conduct, and it should not be used as a rule, but as a set of guidelines</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; I think that's very valueable to have, and I will definitely work on getting it recognized</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AndreasSchuldei </li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; However, I also believe we need to change our Code of Conduct somewhat, like what's now on lists.d.o. It should be reasonable moderate though, to not kill discussion and certainly not for it to be used as a stick to beat people with</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; The code of conduct is a minimalistic and easily applicable measure to determine weather or not my behaviour in the debian context is ok.  It is important that as many as possible know about and agree uppon this measure.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; I think it is quite important that we agree on this kind of guidelines. It should be possible to be able and stop and check if i should really go forward with this mail or just delete it before sending it. It should also be possible to point someone else in a friendly way to the code or conduct and suggest to others that they should check their own behaviour.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; For it to gain more influence on the debian community it is necessary that it becomes widely known and more and more accepted. Perhaps we should pass a GR to ratify it, similar as our constituion. The purpose is not to have a stick to beat someone with but to have a commonly accepted guideline for orientation.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; I am sure that we need this kind of measure and corrective to improve our working climate. If elected, one important task will be to inform people about it and raise awareness of it.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize TedWalther </li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; I am not aware of any proposed "Code of Conduct".  But I believe all</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; developers should have to read through the short, pithy book of</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; etiquette I mentioned earlier on the debian-vote mailing list called</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; Martine's Handbook of Etiquette, by Arthur Martine.  It was written in</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; 1868.  All developers should take a comprehension quiz to make sure</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; they understand it.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AnthonyTowns </li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AFAIK, we don't have "a" code of conduct; I think it'd be worth trying to work on one -- the one's we've had so far have been developed separately and reflect ideas from a bunch of different people.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; I don't think it should be viewed primarily as a way of "correcting people", but as a way of helping people get on with each other so we avoid people getting fed up and quitting or trying to kick people out.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize SteveMcIntyre </li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; A CoC is necessary, IMHO. The exact details need to be thrashed out,</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; and we need to agree on them and then abide by the code we agree.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; That way I think we have more of a chance of avoiding/reducing the</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; flamewars that we're often seeing; let's make it clearer that we will</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; _not_ accept personal insults in technical debates, for example.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize BillAllombert </li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; for the time being, I am opposed to an enforced code of conduct, however I am in favour of a set of guidelines and I gave some in my platform. I am unsure what is "the proposed code" the question refers to.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; next question:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Do you believe Debian has hit a size barrier, with many or even most DD's not reading -devel any more? If so, do you think we're  adequately tackling this problem?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize SteveMcIntyre </li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; no, not neecessarily a size barrier</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; there is more and more detailed debian work going on away from -devel, and that's only natural</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; dwn and the like make it easier for people to keep up, even if they're not readin all the detail on d-devel IME</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AndreasSchuldei </li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; Debian has grown a lot and it needs to find self-organizing structure in order to cope. This could very well be the "small teams" that i have been pushing for some times.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; debian-devel could remain as a central market place but would slow down traffic wise, since much information is moved locally, instead of centrally.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize TedWalther </li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; I don't see any problem with Debian's size.  I think we could easily</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; get bigger.  We aren't all young, single male revolutionaries anymore.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; Debian has become mainstream.  Lots of us don't have time to follow</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; -devel, but we are active in our smaller sub-projects.  That is a good</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; thing, not a bad thing.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AnthonyTowns </li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; No; I think -devel's stagnated because it's signal:noise ratio has dropped substantially, and I think the DD count hasn't risen as much as it might, because it's been displaced by sponsorship and maintainers.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt;  Other lists, and other teams are growing significantly, and there remain lots of new people getting interested in Debian, whether directly or through Ubuntu.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize JeroenVW </li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; Debian is big, but we're actually doing quite fine. A lot of work can happen in specialized teams. However, we should take care to not lose the big picture, Debian needs to have a reasonable number of peopel working on 'general' issues</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; because of the big community etc, we've come to a point where we need to enforce some very very basic minimum social behaviour on lists</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; so that productive and constructive discussion can happen, regardless of the sheer number of people involved</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize BillAllombert </li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; I don't see any size barrier (the number of people contributing to Debian is grwing everyday) and I don' t believe not reading -devel is so much a problem. There are lots of Debian parts that are largely independant. The only issue I see is the lack of view of the "big picture" but I am unsure if debian-devel is supposed to adress that anyway.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt;  Q: What do you think of Debian's status on the desktop? Is Debian capable of making the kind of polished desktop that people expect </li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt;                         from a Linux distribution, and if so what do we need to do to get there?</li>

<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize JeroenVW </li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; We can certainly be a good and polished Desktop distribution too. All it technically takes, would be different d-i options, or the current task selection. However, to really polish it out-of-the-box, we need to make some tradeoffs w.r.t. *defaults*</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; I feel that currently, we're not very good at making such choices, while Ubuntu manages to do so. This does not mean that we should give in on freedom at all, it's all about the defaults</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize SteveMcIntyre </li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; Debian is perfectly capable of making a good desktop distro - I use it</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; myself, and so do many others. But sometimes our users like the latest</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; newest eye candy that our longer release cycles struggle to keep up</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; with. Improving the speed of releases will probably fix most of that</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; Our normal policies mean that we can already do quite a good job of making package work well together</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AnthonyTowns </li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; I'm use ion, so I'm not well qualified to comment on the "desktop" stuff in general; but I think we're well on the way to being able to use the d-i betas and testing security support to solve the "old software" problem,</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; and new updates to Xorg, KDE and Gnome in unstable seem to be being handled fairly well these days; so I think we're well on the way to having good support.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize TedWalther </li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; Debian did many innovative things on the desktop.  Unfortunately, that</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; was a long time ago.  Now we are playing keep-up.  If people come into</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; the project who want to fix that, great.  Otherwise we'll just keep</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; focusing on our strength as a developement and server platform.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt;  </li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize BillAllombert </li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; We need to address the so-called "desktop" globally not packages by packages. Actually d-i had lead progress in that direction. but maybe there is a more general issue of providing predefined "profiles" on top of Debian. that would allow better desktop integration, but also better foo integration for a lot of foo. This is a challenge I consider.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; ok, that concludes the second part of the debate; we're going to enter into the free for all shortly, after a brief 5 minute break.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; un?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; what about me?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; recognize AndreasSchuldei </li>
<li class="meta"><em> * AndreasSchuldei just answers</em></li><li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; Debian could produce a just as polished and well integrated desktop as other distros. The fine-tuning between the packages could happen in extra configuration packages as outlined in Message-ID: &lt;20060305203953.GZ13066@schuldei.org&gt; on -vote.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; sorry, my mistake. ;-)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; Up-to-date software will be much less of an issue once we manage to release more regularly and in shorter intervalls. Joey Hess has good ideas to solve this and I hope he and the d-i team will make them happen.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; done</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; ok, now we've really finished the second part, so we'll start with the free for all in 4 minutes.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; at the end of the free for all, candidates who wish will have 8 minutes to make a closing statement.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; the free for all will end no later than 00:52.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; lets get started.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; what time is it now?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; 00:15</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; 00:14 UTC</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; hm....</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; we're behind schedule. I have to go soon.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: do you need to leave?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; this should have been finished at 4:30pm PST</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; TedWalther: how will this affect your candidacy for DPL?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; erich: your question wasn't quite what you wanted to ask?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; The desktop issue has consistently been an issue which Debian has been brought to task about, both in software versioning, release speed, and desktop integration. What should we do next about that?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; funny, all these DPL candidates, and we have nothing to say to each other :)</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; i have nothing bad to say about ted walther</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: will you prioritize your DPL work as high during the term?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: Bzzzt!  You used the word "prioritize".  Go to the back of the class!</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; We should, as I said above, take care to make decisions in defaults</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW: what in particular should be changed about them?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; and not leave everything up to the user to configure, when there'd be good defaults.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; the FSF helped Debian get off the ground by hiring Ian Murdock to work on Debian full time for a year or two</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; TedWalther: are priorities not a priority for you?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; But more importantly, it should be more fun to work on it, and we should esp. encourage more people to work on polishing tasks</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; I think we should hire an X/Desktop guy to work on our desktop stuff fulltime for a year</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; let us put our money where our hearts are.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; specifically, currently when you install desktop, you get both Gnome and KDE</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; TedWalther: one?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; TedWalther: where should the money come from?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: SPI isn't broke.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; down with bureaucrat-speak; say things that people can understand!</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; TedWalther: who should we hire, and for how much?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: no idea. we have to look into it.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; when you install X via some other way than d-i, you'll need to do a lot of stuff to get things running, and like install xdebconfigurator with all involved suggests</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; TedWalther: please elaborate on this fine suggestion</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; it's not just defaults, it's also alternatives: some people want a rocking Gnome system, others want a slick KDE system, others want something preconfigured for schools -- derived/customised distros are important here too, and knoppix, ubuntu and skolelinux are already good answers for desktop debian</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: as for "how much", market rate is between $35-$100k per year.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; we can improve the way we integrate packages, with additional configuration packages. that would give us an enourmous edge over rpm based distros and ensure that our packages can be used to build tightly integrated derived distros in the future</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; we could hire Zeke, he goes for less than minimum wage</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AriPollak: yay!</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; there should be some glue packages, pulling together related packages. You can apt-get install gnome, or apt-get install kde</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AriPollak: but we work for free. zeke would cost money (c:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; BillAllombert, SteveMcIntyre: you both had talked about the NM in your platforms; what are your feelings about the issues in NM? Specifically issues with AM availability?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; much of this work is already being done...</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: tell that to TedWalther</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; our key innovation before was nothing to do with KDE, Gnome, or any particular window manager.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; but also on a bit more micro level</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; our innovation was in things like "menu" which gave consistent root menus in all window managers</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: we have a lot of NMs in the queue</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; we are integrators more than we are partisans</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; and our desktop innovations should continue to reflect that</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; there's been a lot of complaints about NM being a long, slow process</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; JeroenVW: i agree! outlined that in Message-ID: &lt;20060305203953.GZ13066@schuldei.org&gt; on -vote! (c:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: you had mentioned AM teams; how do you see that working?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: so when are you going to register DUS with the tax office?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; the first step is getting consistent background on all desktop environments</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: what are you doing to make sure that SPI and Debian is not liable for the taxes that DUS owes the government?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: how would NM teams solve the issue of not enough people actually being interested in doing AM work?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; a consistent theme mechanism for all desktops and window managers would be nice.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; oh, well, if we're just asking each other questions...</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; background images. a default set of sound files.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: The social contract's cornerstones are Free Software and our users. Yet, users often find Debian developers extremely difficult  to deal with. How would you put the focus back on the users?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; I'd like to see AMs and mentors work together on helping the NM process</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; in fact, default sound files  have been our weakness for ages.</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; I think we should have "megadeb", the pendent of "udeb" that obey to different rules and are able to apply global setting like 'typical one-user desktop box', '0-user server' etc.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: what question would you like to answer?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: how much money do you think should be in debian's overall budget -- for meetings, debconfs, and whatever else?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; let's try and make NM work more interesting and easier on all sides</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; DUS = Debian UK Society, a business selling debian CDs and merchandise at trade shows</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; I don't think Debian developers are difficult to deal with at all</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; all UK-resident DDs are automatically claimed to be members of the business</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; I am</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: i am not quite sure how much we would need. if we would try to help all people who would liek to attend meetings it can be a LOT</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; and can be fined if they don't register early enough</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; there are always some issues with some people, but in general, DD's are very approacheable, we have an open BTS, etc</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; plus, I'd hope we could encourage NMs to work more on packages that help, rather than concentrate on small packages of their own</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; BillAllombert: How do you plan to implement your assistant projects?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: i made a quick calculation and arrived at ~200k just for work meetings.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; don_armstrong: i don't think users find debian any harder to deal with than developers do; some get annoyed by the conflict or problems, others like it</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; and, most importantly, users can directly talk to the developer that's most relevant for their own bug</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: debconf could easily spend 250k this year</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; it's more a perception issue than a real issue, I thin</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; TedWalther: what do you know about UK societies?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; fsck I hate emacs sometimes.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; we should write more programs to do bandwidth monitoring solely for NMs to package for debian</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: unfortuanly we dont have that much.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; Debian could do well with more resources to further its work</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; the work meetings in Extremadura in spain are a good example.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: how come this decreased? We had a succesful debconf last year, do you think sponsor interest declined, or is the issue (partly) also on the side of Debian here?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: and can you comment on the tradeoff between getting that through sponsors (and possibly selling out, or compromising on non-free stuff or similar) and raising money through donations and such? mostly we do the former, no -- what can we do about the latter?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: Are there any bottleneck groups in Debian, and how do you believe the DPL should help?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AriPollak: (what about irc clients?)</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (I can't remember if that was asked before, but just in case)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; we have to limit ourself to european participants (since the sponsor has limits in his budget, too) and can only have 6meetings per year currently.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; there are a few places in Debian where we _seem_ to have bottlenecks</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; One should not think in terms of bottleneck groups -- but rather, in bottlneck tasks</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; ok, let's assume that it was s/group/task/ to remove the human element.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: irc clients are good too. I don't think anyone's packaged VimIRC yet</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; don_armstrong: This is a part that require creativity, but by integrating what DD do 'unofficially' in Debian, we can reuse their creativity.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; I think the main bottleneck is that our European developers are so group oriented and have such an easier time meeting up with each other because of their superior public transit systems.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AriPollak: the picture in your platform seems to be a derived work based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snakesonaplane1js.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Snakesonaplane1js.jpg</a> -- is it freely licensed? or did you not check as part of your policy to ignore licensing issues?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; JeroenVW: the sponsor issue this year is complex. We are earlier then last year and they just come out of their budget planning and finalizing. then some sponsors had budget cuts.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; this puts developers in other parts of the world at a severe disadvantage</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; JeroenVW: that said our budget this year is bigger then that last year, we will get more money</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; looking into those should be an important task for the DPL; let's see whether they really _are_ an issue, and if so how can we help?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: what areas would those be, and how should we resolve them?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: I know the person who originally made that image, he intended for it to be distributed &amp; modified freely</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: clearly, NM has been mentioned again, as has ftpmaster (picking 2 example, there are more)</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; BillAllombert: the unofficial sub projects, right? What will your role as DPL be in them?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: what is your involvement with Debian UK Society?  where does the money go that is made from t-shirts and cdroms?  and how do you feel about the fact that every DD in the UK is legally liable (fines, etc) for the actions of DUS?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: we had offers for better sponsorship support against better/more liberal treatment of non-free drivers</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: how do you respond to the accusations that you're really a hobbit?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: we did not take that and i think that is a very good thing. debian is not for sale and we have our principles, we dont want to currupt our believes.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AriPollak: i don't</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; in the areas where people are unhappy with how quickly things are going, let's see how the current teams feel</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; yeah, what SteveMcIntyre says, for bottlenecks to be resolved, one needs to find out first, what exactly the problem is</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; how well are they coping, how can we help (more people / more delegation / finer-grained tasks etc)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: i think we need to be more creative in how we ask for money and enable people who would like to support us to do that eaiser and better</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; it is easy enough to set up a Debian repository that everyone who has unfree software should set up their own repository and tell people how to configure APT to point to it, instead of trying to shoe-horn it into Debian.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; does SPI currently pay anyone to actually do work for debian?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; there is a huge community that WANTS to support us</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre, JeroenVW: what will enable us to discern what these problems are? [I guess, what's stoping us from finding them out now?]</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AriPollak: no, no one</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; of the teams that are percieved as blocking, they all know about the (percieved or real) issues, and are willing to work on it</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; when people want to give money to Debian, we should let them!</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: do you feel that being DPL and an ftpmaster might be considered a potential conflict of interest?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; is there anything stopping SPI from doing so, on a consulting basis?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; assuming it had more than enough money</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: yay!</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; if for somereason, resolving bottlenecks hits a snag, that needs (probably) mediation, because *technical* things are hardly ever really blocking us</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; bottle-necks, schmottle-necks.  My bubbe would spang you with a wet towel.</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: it might be considered one; i don't believe it is, any more or less than being a dpkg maintainer, sparc port maintainer, or X maintainer would be</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AriPollak: mako wrote a very good article about what can happen if you introduce money in volunteer communities</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; however, technical solutions can often contribute greatly to resolving an issue, by reducing repetitive work (automating it)</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: there has been a lot of heated discussion on those fronts so far; taking a calm, reasonable effort to find out what's going on will help</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW, SteveMcIntyre: some of the reasons behind the bottlenecks are already known. How long do we need to wait before we act?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; or splitting responabilities</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: in so far as i might make a bad decision as part of ftpmaster, that needs to be corrected, the way to do so is via the technical committee</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; c.f. Joey Hess' blog post about the reign of unix permissions</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW, SteveMcIntyre: (lets assume a hypthetical task just for the sake of discussion)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: how do you feel as a moderator now? do you feel stressed? (c:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: heh</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; anyone know what's keeping python 2.4 from becoming the default python?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: (whose rules indicate that if you're being overruled, you don't get to vote on the issue)</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; As DPL, I will make sure that DUS stops misrepresenting itself as being part of the Debian project.  Debian does NOT make money from the sale of CD's, which DUS does.  This will also eliminate the legal liability that our current DD's are subject to in the UK.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; if DUS wants to be a sponsor or donor of Debian, that is another scenario, and they are welcome to it.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: have you spoken to the involed people, actually?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: I don't think that all the issues are as clear-cut as some people believe; making unfounded assumptions about the problems will not help us solve them</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; don_armstrong: it's impossible to talk in generalities about this, it's really a per-case issue. Teams really want to work properly themselves too, a DPL needs to assist in enabling the teams to get that done more efficiently where needed</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; TedWalther: linux australia holds some money on debian's behalf from the sale of merchandise (t-shirts with a debian logo in this case), as DPL would you insist that money is not debian's?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: i took the opportunity to talk to Phill Hands on the phone about this. did you?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; also, there's often wide misconception about the real bottlenecks</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; don_armstrong: I will work toward integrating them properly, and eventually foster new one.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: other organizations may sell merchandise on our behalf.  We cannot accept legal liability for what other people do with our products</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AriPollak: the python team are trying to change the policy to make upgrades work better in future, and the 2.4 transition is blocking on that</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: only once a really clear view will be able to work on the core problems</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: so, when linux australia donates money to Debian, then that is Debians money.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: that is the reason we have SPI to handle our money.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: DUS can move to an arrangement like that if it wants.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: the python team is, or other people are?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: does linux australia represent itself as "Debian" at trade shows?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: there are a couple of other foundation or organisations holding debian money.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW, AndreasSchuldei: What will be different about the DPL team this year?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: erm, I don't think that's true, one can go for python 2.4 without waiting on the tool transition, and I think we should do so reasonably soon</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AriPollak: how will you cope with splitting your time between Debian and Zeke?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: I don't have to split my time, Zeke maintains my packages while I pet him</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: there's a number of issues to be hit because of python language changes, we shouldn't postpone too long on those</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: we made changes to have it more open</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; to make sure we don't loose momentum</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW, SteveMcIntyre: what should we do about issues of human recalcitrance in teams?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: delegation will happen very soon during the term</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; don_armstrong: I will lead my team with a strong agenda, and good idea's how to achieve my goals</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: encourage people to be honest when they can't keep up with what they've volunteered to do</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: we can only switch to py2.4 by changing lots of packages (python-foo depends: python &gt;= 2.4, python2.4-foo), that would also have to be changed with the better upgrade stuff; the RMs are more up to date on this than i am ttbomk</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; What measures do the other candidates plan to take when expelling a project member for "anti-social" behavior?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; JeroenVW, SteveMcIntyre: that is, where people are either blocking progress or being overtly hostline over it?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: the team will be more flexible, too. we will have changes when people get tired and take new people in</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; Who gets to be the judge?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; can i speculate more about python 2.4?</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; I don't plan to expell anyone.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: if necessary, push them to accept help until the teams are able to work effectively again</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; being the initiator of the current setup, I feel I can guide the team to being most effective, having good idea's what's needed. I've also learned from the past year, what things will *not* work</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; BillAllombert: SteveMcIntyre made it clear that he does plan to expell people for their social behavior, and other DPL candidates danced around the issue, leaving it open for them to do so later.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; TedWalther: that question didn't make any sense</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: in the current expulsion procedure the DAM is involved in weighing the arguements.</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: any thoughts on what to do if they don't wish to accept?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; BillAllombert: said DPL candidates have also had a past history of confusing deeply and sincerely held religious beliefs with "trolling" and being "anti-social"</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (just a reminder, we're at the 15 minutes left mark)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: but most of the judging will be done by lots of developers</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: yeah, this isn't something the DPL should decide about anyway, more something for the release team to be involved in</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; BillAllombert: to quote Jahldar, "You think I'm insane now because I believe in 1,000,000 gods"?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: in extreme cases where a job is not being done and it hurts, we would have to put more people in regardless</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: what teams don't you think are functional atm? ftpmaster? DAM/n-m? security? others?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: at the moment, I don't think any teams are necessarily non-functional</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: do you think that taking up religious topics during such a debate helps?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; but one of the first jobs of the new DPL will be to talk to all the teams and find out the true situation</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: do you think that trying to kick people out of the project because you don't like their religious views is something to sweep under the carpet?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: i think teams can work much better.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: we should aim for the "much better" instead of "not non-functional"</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: Do you believe that the DPL should make any sort of technical decisions? If not, why are several of you discussing them?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: absolutely, yes</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: are the teams in the best position to tell if they're non-functional? if people on -devel or elsewhere consider them non-functional, but the team thinks things are operating fine... what happens?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; as an international project with representation of all the major cultures and religions, it is important not to go down the road of religious discrimination, which several of this years DPL candidates have openly done on IRC.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: i think the release team is a good example of a core team that works well</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; but let's see exactly where we are before we start promising to "fix" things</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: but even more interesting in my eyes is the security team which started to reform itself.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; don_armstrong: would you rather we discuss religious issues?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; when DPL candidates are behaving like this, can you really vote for them in good conscience?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; Technical decisions shouldn't be made by the DPL, period. It's hard to follow on the huge amounts of text here and keep on topic</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: the DPL should absolutely make technical decisions for *himself*</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; for the project as a whole, I doubt that a DPL will be able to make "decisions" stick</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; don_armstrong: the DPL's role is to lead discussion within debian, and technical discussions are what makes debian great; that's different from actually making the final decision though, which generally isn't the DPL's place</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; I may be unpopular in many ways, but I live and let live.  Something the clean-cut posterboys I am debating with don't seem to agree with as a policy.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; he can help others come to those decisions, and prod where necessary...</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: it started out as one of the most opaque teams in the project and now it is changeing its tools, its structure and by that even manages to involve many more people</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns words my sentiment quite well</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; i don't think i've ever been called a clean-cut posterboy before, how awesome</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Another key issue that many of you brought up in your platforms is communication; what would you do as DPL to improve communcation?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; JeroenVW: i think the dpl could encourage certain technical development</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: *grin*</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; i propose SPI buys a Debian-based smartphone for all Debian developers</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; don_armstrong: delegate to steve, jeroen, bill, enrico and others ideally</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; there has been a lot of talk about expulsions in Debian recently.  Even in this debate the other conversants are staying silent.  Because they know I am telling the truth.  And they hope it will go away and they won't have to deal with the effects of their bigotry.</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; then we can all communicate via IRC from wherever we are</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; AriPollak: do you know of any such device yet available? :-)</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; oh, ++pasc and some of jeroen's team members who also expressed a firm interest in that area</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: you want to form a DPL team :)?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; to make it slightly more apropos: What, 12 months from now, do you want to see changed in regards communcation, and how will that happen?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: not yet, but i'm going to be introducing another Debian port called Snakes on a cellphonew</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; JeroenVW / AndreasSchuldei : after working together on the DPL team last year, you're standing separately this year, with (mostly) different teams?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; Now, on to the real topic.</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; don_armstrong: Add peope dedicated to communication helping teams.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; we need to have a poll on what is Debians official brand of beer.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; How well did the DPl team work last year, and why so different this time?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: no, i want a communications team that can focus on easing out the conflicts that've blown up into expulsion attempts recently; leadership's more than just making sure people can talk, it's making sure things get done too</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (we've got 8 minutes left)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: i would want a calmer and more informative debian-devel@l.d.o</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; if we all had IRC on our phones, we could all discuss the pressing emergency issues as they come up, like whether or not to play tetrinet</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; TedWalther: by the way, can you please if you're going to accuse people, fellow DPL candidates in this case, from discriminating based on religion, provide proof for such accusations? I think that's a very strong accusation to make, and I think it's very badfor the atmosphere in Debian</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; BillAllombert: how will these people be identified/teams formed?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: ah, I see, thank you for the clarification</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; i would hope that people know about the code of conduct and manage to abide by it.</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; JeroenVW: thats all been done on the mailing lists.  read through -vote, -devel, and -private</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: how do you envision that happening?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: (there's a difference between a "dpl team" like you and andreas have, and a group of people randomly working together to support the dpl, which is all i'm getting at)</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; JeroenVW: also, I've started keeping IRC logs, which include your own prejudiced attitudes.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; I want, in 1 year, to see a -devel list excelling in having lots of nice technical discussions</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; don_armstrong: make the code of conduct know? it is a simple and tedious task: talk about it a lot.</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; I will ask for volunteers and starting from there.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; at conferences, at meetings, on irc...</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; discussions of which it's obvious we're here together with lots of skilled people, having fun making Debian an even better distribution that it already is</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; there's several ways to improve comms in the project</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; and i would try to live by it. (c:</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Q: It's been said that the DPL can act as a facilitator and leader of discussion. We haven't seen much of this over the past few  years, at least outright. How do you plan to do things differently?</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; and encourage as many as possibel to do the same.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; firstly, sort out some of the unneeded flamewars that have blighted us more recently</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: (with enough people around, there's always someone who's interested in any task, no matter how tedious you think it might be)</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; TedWalther: can you prove one quote where I'm discriminating based on religion? Permission to quote granted hereby</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: i hope so.</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; secondly, keep up-to-date with the various teams doing their jobs and see what's being done</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (5 minutes)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: i consider that task important enough to dedicate some of my time to it, too. for example when giving a talk at a formal dinner at debconf.</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; don_armstrong: I think it actually happened a lot but privately. My plan is to CC my initial emails to debian-email so there is a trace something was done.</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; in one year, I hope we won't actually really need the, slightly stronger by then, code of conduct to enforce a basic level of conduct</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; JeroenVW: not in the timeframe of this debate.  we can do it later though</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; if they need help in communicating with the rest of us, find voluteers to help or even dive in personally to get things going</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; but that an interesting place to work like Debian, attracts more interesting and interested people, and people who feel the need to divide, leave</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; don_armstrong: i expect i'd lead discussions in a similar way to the release and arch qualification discussions; i'm much happier to do that in an area that has some sort of conduct guidelines, personally</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; Are there any interesting discussions that we should be having but aren't having currently?</li>
<li class="n21"> &lt;<b>+TedWalther</b>&gt; have to leave now.</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; TedWalther: bye!</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; don_armstrong: undoubtedly! :-)</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; don_armstrong: we should talk about expelling people more</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; AriPollak: why?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: which ones?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: you want guidelines that would involve also banning people who just lose their patience for a bit?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; AndreasSchuldei: because it's so productive</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (3 minutes)</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: even though, they generally are very productive?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; I'd be amazed if there aren't people with ideas and suggestions who are keeping quiet at the moment</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; for a start</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; and would stop out of their own?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: how should they be involved?</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: i'd rather people not lose their patience in the first place; or if they feel the need to yell, not do it at me</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; make the lists more welcoming and they will come...</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: if that means temporarily devoicing someone as happened earlier in the debate, i have no problem with that</li>
<li class="n11"> &lt;<b>+BillAllombert</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: Would you apply this standard to yourself ?</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (two minutes)</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; make the whole of debian more welcome, even!</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; (yay, bad movie mis-quote!)</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; BillAllombert: i'd hope someone else would apply that standard to me</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre: how will that happen?</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; AnthonyTowns: would you want to apply similar rules to the lists?</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; we should temporarily set mode +m on lists when they get out of hand</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; and then only the bots can speak</li>
<li class="n5"> &lt;<b>+AnthonyTowns</b>&gt; JeroenVW: i'd really rather someone else decide that -- i've had my play with codes of conduct this year with #d-tech, i think it's other people's turn to have a go</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; let's try and kill the flamewars; let's take technical discussions on merit rather than falling onto ad hominem attacks more</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; How do you intend to keep a positive, enthusiastic attitude (i.e., productive) during your tenure as DPL, and how do you intend to project</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; that attitude inwards to the Debian Developers and outwards to the outer community?</li>
<li class="n2"> &lt;<b>+SteveMcIntyre</b>&gt; I think we might be surprised at how much difference that can make</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; SteveMcIntyre++</li>
<li class="n10"> &lt;<b>@don_armstrong</b>&gt; (30 seconds)</li>
<li class="n22"> &lt;<b>+AriPollak</b>&gt; flaming people usually brings the morale up in the project</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; (15 seconds)</li>
<li class="n18"> &lt;<b>+JeroenVW</b>&gt; don_armstrong: keep having fun myself, first and forall</li>
<li class="n8"> &lt;<b>+AndreasSchuldei</b>&gt; over !!!!</li>
