    Welcome everyone to the 2006 Debian Project Leader Debate
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    The debate this year will be split into three separate sections
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    the first will be a composed response, where the candidates will answer
    questions that you all have submitted
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    we will spend the first 30-45 minutes on this section, the candidates will
    have 6 minutes to compose a response.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    we'll then take a break, during which I'll explain the second part.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    if you want to know in advance how it all will work, see /topic, where the
    debate rules are explained.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    we're currently awaiting a few of the candidates, so hang on just a second
    for them to arrive.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    please feel free to discuss what is happening in the debate in -discuss;
    throughout the debate questions that you pose will be picked up by
    panelists
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    these questions will be used wherever possible.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    today, Thaddeus H. Black, David Nusinow, Martin-&#201;ric Racine, and MJ

    Q: There are some open issues in Debian, like multiarch and non-free kernel
    modules that seem to  get bogged down due to the fact that there is no real
    consensus and thus neither proponents nor opponents manage to force the
    issue. Do you  feel a DPL should take a more active role in identifying or
    even setting the project standpoint and making sure it is implemented
    within a  reasonable timeframe?
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    Furthermore, how would you help this process to occur

    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    if the DPL has time, he should use his role to help the project arrive at a
    consensus.  But at the end of the day, it is the kernel team that will make
    those hard decisions.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    TedWalther: please don't respond unless you've been recognized.
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    the DPL generally doesn't try to set technical policy, and I see that as a
    good thing

    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    I don't think "forcing" the issue is a good thing, or having the DPL "set
    the project standpoint"; but having the DPL lead discussions, and try to
    make sure that the various options are clearly presented and refined is
    important,
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    as is making sure that we come to /some/ decision, even if that's "we don't
    know enough yet, let's investigate ____ ____ and ____ further, and then

    </li>
  <li class="n11"> &lt;<strong>+BillAllombert</strong>&gt;
    Most of the time the issue is that there are several workable solutions.
    The DPL can play a role by gathering everybody opinion and lead them to a
    consensus solution. This is especially important if it involves non-DEbian
    entities.

    if nobody is interested to put time in it, it won't work

    forward a GR to modify Policy, which the kernel team will then have to

    The DPL is in this case just a normal developer, with a higher soap-box.

    following his attempts of moderation.

  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    I would try to get people to talk about hard topics like these at DebConfs,
    for example, where there is time and plenty of bandwidth to do so and less
    chance of missunderstanding.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;

  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    There is a debian community guidelines in the works by Enrico Zini.
    However, this is not intended as Code of Conduct, and it should not be used
    as a rule, but as a set of guidelines
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    I think that's very valueable to have, and I will definitely work on
    getting it recognized

  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    recognize AndreasSchuldei 
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    However, I also believe we need to change our Code of Conduct somewhat,
    like what's now on lists.d.o. It should be reasonable moderate though, to
    not kill discussion and certainly not for it to be used as a stick to beat
    people with
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    The code of conduct is a minimalistic and easily applicable measure to
    determine weather or not my behaviour in the debian context is ok.  It is
    important that as many as possible know about and agree uppon this measure.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    I think it is quite important that we agree on this kind of guidelines. It
    should be possible to be able and stop and check if i should really go
    forward with this mail or just delete it before sending it. It should also
    be possible to point someone else in a friendly way to the code or conduct
    and suggest to others that they should check their own behaviour.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    For it to gain more influence on the debian community it is necessary that
    it becomes widely known and more and more accepted. Perhaps we should pass
    a GR to ratify it, similar as our constituion. The purpose is not to have a
    stick to beat someone with but to have a commonly accepted guideline for
    orientation.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    I am sure that we need this kind of measure and corrective to improve our
    working climate. If elected, one important task will be to inform people
    about it and raise awareness of it.

    AFAIK, we don't have "a" code of conduct; I think it'd be worth trying to
    work on one -- the one's we've had so far have been developed separately
    and reflect ideas from a bunch of different people.
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    I don't think it should be viewed primarily as a way of "correcting
    people", but as a way of helping people get on with each other so we avoid
    people getting fed up and quitting or trying to kick people out.

    and we need to agree on them and then abide by the code we agree.

    general; but I think we're well on the way to being able to use the d-i
    betas and testing security support to solve the "old software" problem,
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    and new updates to Xorg, KDE and Gnome in unstable seem to be being handled
    fairly well these days; so I think we're well on the way to having good
    support.

    We need to address the so-called "desktop" globally not packages by
    packages. Actually d-i had lead progress in that direction. but maybe there
    is a more general issue of providing predefined "profiles" on top of
    Debian. that would allow better desktop integration, but also better foo
    integration for a lot of foo. This is a challenge I consider.

    we can improve the way we integrate packages, with additional configuration

  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;

  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    JeroenVW: the sponsor issue this year is complex. We are earlier then last
    year and they just come out of their budget planning and finalizing. then
    some sponsors had budget cuts.
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    this puts developers in other parts of the world at a severe disadvantage

    will get more money
    </li>

    it is easy enough to set up a Debian repository that everyone who has

    As DPL, I will make sure that DUS stops misrepresenting itself as being
    part of the Debian project.  Debian does NOT make money from the sale of
    CD's, which DUS does.  This will also eliminate the legal liability that
    our current DD's are subject to in the UK.
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    if DUS wants to be a sponsor or donor of Debian, that is another scenario,
    and they are welcome to it.

    TedWalther: have you spoken to the involed people, actually?
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: I don't think that all the issues are as clear-cut as some

    help us solve them
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: it's impossible to talk in generalities about this, it's
    really a per-case issue. Teams really want to work properly themselves too,
    a DPL needs to assist in enabling the teams to get that done more
    efficiently where needed
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    TedWalther: linux australia holds some money on debian's behalf from the
    sale of merchandise (t-shirts with a debian logo in this case), as DPL
    would you insist that money is not debian's?
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;

    foster new one.

  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: other organizations may sell merchandise on our behalf.  We
    cannot accept legal liability for what other people do with our products
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    AriPollak: the python team are trying to change the policy to make upgrades
    work better in future, and the 2.4 transition is blocking on that

    is Debians money.

  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: that is the reason we have SPI to handle our money.

    shows?

    AnthonyTowns: erm, I don't think that's true, one can go for python 2.4
    without waiting on the tool transition, and I think we should do so
    reasonably soon

    while I pet him
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: there's a number of issues to be hit because of python
    language changes, we shouldn't postpone too long on those
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: we made changes to have it more open

    recalcitrance in teams?

  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: encourage people to be honest when they can't keep up with
    what they've volunteered to do
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    JeroenVW: we can only switch to py2.4 by changing lots of packages
    (python-foo depends: python &gt;= 2.4, python2.4-foo), that would also have
    to be changed with the better upgrade stuff; the RMs are more up to date on
    this than i am ttbomk

    What measures do the other candidates plan to take when expelling a project

    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    JeroenVW, SteveMcIntyre: that is, where people are either blocking progress
    or being overtly hostline over it?

  <li class="n11"> &lt;<strong>+BillAllombert</strong>&gt;
    I don't plan to expell anyone.
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: if necessary, push them to accept help until the teams are
    able to work effectively again
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    being the initiator of the current setup, I feel I can guide the team to
    being most effective, having good idea's what's needed. I've also learned
    from the past year, what things will *not* work
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    BillAllombert: SteveMcIntyre made it clear that he does plan to expell
    people for their social behavior, and other DPL candidates danced around
    the issue, leaving it open for them to do so later.
    </li>
  <li class="n22"> &lt;<strong>+AriPollak</strong>&gt;
    TedWalther: that question didn't make any sense
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;

    weighing the arguements.
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: any thoughts on what to do if they don't wish to accept?
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    BillAllombert: said DPL candidates have also had a past history of
    confusing deeply and sincerely held religious beliefs with "trolling" and
    being "anti-social"

    (just a reminder, we're at the 15 minutes left mark)
    </li>

    TedWalther: but most of the judging will be done by lots of developers
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: yeah, this isn't something the DPL should decide about
    anyway, more something for the release team to be involved in
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    BillAllombert: to quote Jahldar, "You think I'm insane now because I

  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;

    we would have to put more people in regardless

  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: what teams don't you think are functional atm? ftpmaster?
    DAM/n-m? security? others?
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: at the moment, I don't think any teams are necessarily
    non-functional
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    TedWalther: do you think that taking up religious topics during such a
    debate helps?
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    but one of the first jobs of the new DPL will be to talk to all the teams
    and find out the true situation
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    AndreasSchuldei: do you think that trying to kick people out of the project
    because you don't like their religious views is something to sweep under
    the carpet?
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: i think teams can work much better.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: we should aim for the "much better" instead of "not
    non-functional"
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    Q: Do you believe that the DPL should make any sort of technical decisions?
    If not, why are several of you discussing them?
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    AndreasSchuldei: absolutely, yes
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: are the teams in the best position to tell if they're
    non-functional? if people on -devel or elsewhere consider them
    non-functional, but the team thinks things are operating fine... what
    happens?
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    as an international project with representation of all the major cultures
    and religions, it is important not to go down the road of religious
    discrimination, which several of this years DPL candidates have openly done
    on IRC.
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: i think the release team is a good example of a core team
    that works well
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    but let's see exactly where we are before we start promising to "fix"
    things
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: but even more interesting in my eyes is the security team
    which started to reform itself.
    </li>
  <li class="n22"> &lt;<strong>+AriPollak</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: would you rather we discuss religious issues?
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    when DPL candidates are behaving like this, can you really vote for them in
    good conscience?
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    Technical decisions shouldn't be made by the DPL, period. It's hard to
    follow on the huge amounts of text here and keep on topic
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: the DPL should absolutely make technical decisions for
    *himself*
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    for the project as a whole, I doubt that a DPL will be able to make
    "decisions" stick
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: the DPL's role is to lead discussion within debian, and
    technical discussions are what makes debian great; that's different from
    actually making the final decision though, which generally isn't the DPL's
    place
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    I may be unpopular in many ways, but I live and let live.  Something the
    clean-cut posterboys I am debating with don't seem to agree with as a
    policy.
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    he can help others come to those decisions, and prod where necessary...
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    SteveMcIntyre: it started out as one of the most opaque teams in the
    project and now it is changeing its tools, its structure and by that even
    manages to involve many more people
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns words my sentiment quite well
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    i don't think i've ever been called a clean-cut posterboy before, how
    awesome
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    Another key issue that many of you brought up in your platforms is
    communication; what would you do as DPL to improve communcation?
    </li>

    there has been a lot of talk about expulsions in Debian recently.  Even in

    deal with the effects of their bigotry.

    I will ask for volunteers and starting from there.

    discussions of which it's obvious we're here together with lots of skilled
    people, having fun making Debian an even better distribution that it

    Q: It's been said that the DPL can act as a facilitator and leader of
    discussion. We haven't seen much of this over the past few  years, at least
    outright. How do you plan to do things differently?
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    and encourage as many as possibel to do the same.
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    firstly, sort out some of the unneeded flamewars that have blighted us more
    recently
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    AndreasSchuldei: (with enough people around, there's always someone who's
    interested in any task, no matter how tedious you think it might be)
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    TedWalther: can you prove one quote where I'm discriminating based on
    religion? Permission to quote granted hereby
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: i hope so.
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    secondly, keep up-to-date with the various teams doing their jobs and see
    what's being done
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    (5 minutes)
    </li>
  <li class="n8"> &lt;<strong>+AndreasSchuldei</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: i consider that task important enough to dedicate some of my
    time to it, too. for example when giving a talk at a formal dinner at
    debconf.
    </li>
  <li class="n11"> &lt;<strong>+BillAllombert</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: I think it actually happened a lot but privately. My plan is
    to CC my initial emails to debian-email so there is a trace something was
    done.
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    in one year, I hope we won't actually really need the, slightly stronger by
    then, code of conduct to enforce a basic level of conduct
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    JeroenVW: not in the timeframe of this debate.  we can do it later though
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    if they need help in communicating with the rest of us, find voluteers to
    help or even dive in personally to get things going
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    but that an interesting place to work like Debian, attracts more
    interesting and interested people, and people who feel the need to divide,
    leave
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    don_armstrong: i expect i'd lead discussions in a similar way to the
    release and arch qualification discussions; i'm much happier to do that in
    an area that has some sort of conduct guidelines, personally
    </li>
  <li class="n10"> &lt;<strong>@don_armstrong</strong>&gt;
    Are there any interesting discussions that we should be having but aren't
    having currently?
    </li>
  <li class="n21"> &lt;<strong>+TedWalther</strong>&gt;
    have to leave now.

  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;

    who just lose their patience for a bit?
    </li>
  <li class="n22"> &lt;<strong>+AriPollak</strong>&gt;
    AndreasSchuldei: because it's so productive

    I'd be amazed if there aren't people with ideas and suggestions who are
    keeping quiet at the moment

    for a start

    SteveMcIntyre: how should they be involved?
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;

    if they feel the need to yell, not do it at me
    </li>
  <li class="n2"> &lt;<strong>+SteveMcIntyre</strong>&gt;
    make the lists more welcoming and they will come...
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;

    in the debate, i have no problem with that

    SteveMcIntyre: how will that happen?
    </li>
  <li class="n18"> &lt;<strong>+JeroenVW</strong>&gt;
    AnthonyTowns: would you want to apply similar rules to the lists?
    </li>
  <li class="n22"> &lt;<strong>+AriPollak</strong>&gt;
    we should temporarily set mode +m on lists when they get out of hand
    </li>
  <li class="n22"> &lt;<strong>+AriPollak</strong>&gt;
    and then only the bots can speak
    </li>
  <li class="n5"> &lt;<strong>+AnthonyTowns</strong>&gt;
    JeroenVW: i'd really rather someone else decide that -- i've had my play
    with codes of conduct this year with #d-tech, i think it's other people's
    turn to have a go
