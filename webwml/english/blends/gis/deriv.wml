<p>The Debian source packages maintained by the Debian GIS team are also used
by efforts to support current GIS software on Debian derivatives. This page lists
some of the derivative efforts we are aware of.</p>

<p>UbuntuGIS provides backports of GIS packages for Ubuntu. Your Ubuntu is
ready for daily, professional GIS work. Getting started it's just a matter of
minutes. After adding the UbuntuGIS repository corresponding to their
distribution (in sources.list), you can easily install on your machine each of
the GIS applications listed below (in brackets the package name), through the
Synaptic Package Manager or typing sudo apt-get install program-name from the
command line, just like any other package.</p>

<p>OSGeo-Live is a self-contained bootable DVD, USB thumb drive or Virtual
Machine based on Lubuntu, that allows you to try a wide variety of open source
geospatial software without installing anything. It is composed entirely of
free software, allowing it to be freely distributed, duplicated and passed
around. It provides pre-configured applications for a range of geospatial use
cases, including storage, publishing, viewing, analysis and manipulation of
data. It also contains sample datasets and documentation.</p>
