<p>Debian Pure Blends are a solution for special groups of users with different
skills and interests. Not only do they provide handy collections (metapackages)
of specific program packages, but they also ease installation and configuration
for the intended purpose.</p>

<p>Debian Pure Blends are not forks from Debian. As the name underlines, they are
pure Debian and just provide a specific flavour. So if you obtain the complete
Debian GNU/Linux distribution, you have all available Debian Pure Blends
available for installation.</p>

<p>Debian Pure Blends are also just called Blends when used clearly in the Debian
internal context which makes "Pure" and "Debian" obvious, like on this page.
They were formerly known as Custom Debian Distributions - this name was changed
because it was confusing too much users on  be something else
than Debian.</p>

   <p>You can read more about Debian Pure Blends in the <a
href="http://blends.debian.org/blends/">Pure Blends Manual</a>.</p>
