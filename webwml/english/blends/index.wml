<p>Debian Pure Blends are a solution for special groups of users with different
skills and interests. Not only do they provide handy collections (metapackages)
of specific program packages, but they also ease installation and configuration
for the intended purpose.</p>

<p>Debian Pure Blends are not forks from Debian. As the name underlines, they are
pure Debian and just provide a specific flavour. So if you obtain the complete
Debian GNU/Linux distribution, you have all available Debian Pure Blends
available for installation.</p>

<p>Debian Pure Blends are also just called Blends when used clearly in the
Debian internal context which makes "Pure" and "Debian" obvious, like on this
page.</p>

   <p>You can read more about Debian Pure Blends in the <a
href="http://blends.debian.org/blends/">Pure Blends Manual</a>.</p>

<h2>Released Blends</h2>

<p>"Released" may have different meanings for different blends. At a minimum,
it means that the blend has metapackages that were released in a stable release
of Debian, although blends may also provide installation media or form the
basis of a derivative distribution. See the individual blend pages for more
information on that particular blend.</p>
