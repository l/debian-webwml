<p>Debian Pure Blends - in short Blends if used clearly in the Debian internal
context which makes "Pure" and "Debian" obvious - which were formerly known as
Custom Debian Distributions (this name was confusing because it left to much
room for speculation that this might be something else than Debian) try to
provide a solution for special groups of target users with different skills and
interests. Not only do they provide handy collections of specific program
packages, but they also ease installation and configuration for the intended
purpose.</p>

<p>Debian Pure Blends are not forks from Debian. As the name suggests,
they are pure Debian and just provide a specific flavour. So if you obtain the
complete Debian GNU/Linux distribution, you have all available Debian Pure
Blends available for installation.</p>

  <h2>Learn More</h2>
  <div>
   <p>A general purpose operating system like Debian can be the perfect
solution for many different problems. Whether you want Debian to work for you
in the classroom, as a games machine, or in the office, each problem area has
its own unique needs and requires a different subset of packages tailored in a
different way.</p>
   <p>Debian Pure Blends provide support for special user interests. They
implement a new approach to cover interests of specialised users, who might be
children, lawyers, medical staff, visually impaired people, etc. Of late,
several Debian Pure Blends have evolved. The common goal of those is to make
installation and administration of computers for their target users as easy as
possible, and to serve in the role as the missing link between software
developers and users well.</p>
   <p>You can read more about Debian Pure Blends in the <a
href="http://blends.debian.org/blends/">Pure Blends Manual</a>.</p>
