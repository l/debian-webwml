<p>
Debian Pure Blends are a solution for groups of people with specific needs.
Not only do they provide handy collections (meta-packages) of specific packages,
but they also ease installation and configuration for the intended purpose.
They cover the interests of different groups of people, who might be children,
scientists, gamers, lawyers, medical staff, visually impaired people, etc.
Their common goal is to simplify installation and administration of
computers for their target audience, and to connect that audience
with the people writing or packaging the software they use.

<p>"Released" may have different meanings for different blends. In most cases
it means that the blend has metapackages or an installer that was released in a
stable release of Debian. Blends may also provide installation media or form
the basis of a derivative distribution. See the individual blend pages for more
information on that particular blend.</p>
