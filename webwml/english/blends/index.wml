   <p>A general purpose operating system like Debian can be the perfect
solution for many different problems. Whether you want Debian to work for you
in the classroom, as a games machine, or in the office, each problem area has
its own unique needs and requires a different subset of packages tailored in a
different way.</p>
   <p>Debian Pure Blends provide support for special user interests. They
implement a new approach to cover interests of specialised users, who might be
children, lawyers, medical staff, visually impaired people, etc. Of late,
several Debian Pure Blends have evolved. The common goal of those is to make
installation and administration of computers for their target users as easy as
possible, and to serve in the role as the missing link between software
developers and users well.</p>
