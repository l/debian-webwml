<define-tag intro>

<p><a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
most important exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers
Free Software and GNU/Linux.  Four
years ago the event has interested about 17,000 visitors (15,000
people were counted in 2001).  The motto is <em>Where .com meets
.org</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
quality gratis conference program.</p>

<define-tag involve>

<p>The Debian project will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
middle of the regular exhibition space alongside with company
booths.  After a long time this is another opportunity
to put a large number of names and email addresses to faces and personalities.  The
Debian distribution will probably run on several different hardware platforms and
many developers will staff the booth.  Most non-i386 architectures will
be demonstrated on the Linux Portierungen booth.</p>

<p>A one-day conference called Debian day may be helt on Wednesday
or Thursday, aiming at developers and interested users.</p>
