<define-tag intro>

<p><a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
most important exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers
Free Software and GNU/Linux.  Four
years ago the event has interested about 17,000 visitors, 19,500 people were counted last year.
The motto is <em>Where .com meets
.org</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
quality gratis conference program.</p>

<define-tag involve>

<p>The Debian project will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
middle of the regular exhibition space alongside with company
booths.  After a long time this is another opportunity
to put a large number of names and email addresses to faces
and personalities.  The Debian Project will show its distribution
running on different hardware platforms, but most non-i386
architectures will be demonstrated on the Linux Ports booth. Many
developers will staff the booth.</p>

<p>A one-day conference called Debian day may be held on
Thursday, aiming at developers and interested users.</p>

<p>Additionally the Debian Project will demonstrate Debian installation
daily at 11am, 2pm and 5pm.</p>

<p>Last but not least the Debian Project will again hand out - thanks to their
sponsors - a LinuxTag special edition disc. This time a DVD of the upcoming
stable release codenamed "sarge", dual bootable for the x86 and the PowerPC
architecture. There will be burned CDs available for other architectures.</p>
