<define-tag intro>

    <p><a href="http://www.webb.it/">Webb.it</a> is the largest
    computer and technology meeting in Italy, for hobbyists and
    professionals alike. Webb.it is an event dedicated to software
    development and programming, web design and graphics, new media,
    hardware, networking and even marketing and business.

    <p>About 1200 "resident" participants will attend WebbitCon with their
    computers, to live and sleep in the Arena, always connected to the
    high-speed intranet, with a 156&nbsp;MBit/s connection to the internet. Others
    will be there to attend some of the more than 300 workshops (WebbitEdu)
    organized by software and hardware companies and user communities. Other
    visitors will just hang around in the area outside of the arena where the
    sponsors and various companies will have their booths (WebbitPro).

<define-tag involve>

    <p>Debian will be present with some space in the Free Software
    Island, a big area built from two <a
    href="http://www.webbitcon.org/article/articleview/313/">WebbitCon
    Islands</a>, with 2 workshop rooms (with big plasma displays), 8
    mini-stands (Debian will have one) and about 60 networked places for
    visitors and Debian users.

    <p>Some Debian developers and enthusiasts will be there to install
    GNU/Linux on visitors' machines and help anybody wishing to switch
    from proprietary to free software... After a long time this is
    another opportunity to put names and email addresses to faces and
    personalities. Debian developers will also hold some talks and
    demonstrations in the workshop space of the Island.
