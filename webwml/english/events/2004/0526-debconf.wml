<define-tag intro>

<p>Debconf is a conference with, by and for Debian
Developers. Non-developers are quite welcome to attend, but are not
the conference's primary audience.  DebCamp will be mixed with DebConf, 
from May 26th to June 2nd. This is a chance for developers to work together
in a less formal setting.  Debconf will also be participating in the 
<a href="http://www.softwarelivre.org/">V Fórum Internacional do Software
Livre</a>, one of the biggest Free Software events in the world, from 
June 3rd to 5th.</p>
