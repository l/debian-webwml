<p>During the exhibition the Debian booth was approached by <a
href="http://www.h2o-computer.de/">H2O</a>, a manufacturer of
low-noise cooling aggregates and computers.  They demonstrated a
water-cooled Pentium IV machine running at 3.7&nbsp;GHz (overclocked,
called a »5000+ System«) but many visitors wanted to know whether
GNU/Linux would run on it as well.</p>

<p>So they approached the Linuxland booth to purchase some CDs for
installation.  Hence, Alexander Schmehl helped them install Debian on
the machine.  The installation of the base system took less than 5
minutes, and they decided to install the desktop environment, games,
office environment and German environment task: quite some packages.
The entire installation was done in less than 15 minutes.</p>

<p>It could have been faster, though.  The bottleneck were the CD
drive (although it was a 48 speed drive), network connection and disc
drive.  Those components couldn't keep up with the processor speed.</p>

<p>The kernel said that it has some 7372.9 Bogomips (if
that counts anything).  Playing around a little bit with XFree86 he
got 4540.8&nbsp;fps with glxgears, and 500&nbsp;fps while playing
Tuxracer.  Xaos runs quite good (even in a 1600x1200 true color
resolution).</p>

<p>This <a href="http://gallery.schmehl.info/H2O">machine</a> does
not only exist for the show, but can purchased as well (around
&euro;&nbsp;999.00!).  H2O calls it the »fastest freely available (i386)
computer at CeBIT«.</p>
