<define-tag intro>

<p>Debconf is a conference with, by and for Debian
Developers. Non-developers are quite welcome to attend, but are not
the conference's primary audience.  The week starts off with DebCamp
(May 26th - June 2nd), a chance for developers to work together in an
less formal setting.  Debconf will also be participanting in the V
Fórum Internacional do Software Livre, one of the biggest Free
Software events in the world, from June 3rd to 5th.</p>
