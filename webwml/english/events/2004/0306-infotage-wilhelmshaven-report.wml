<p>This event took part on March 6th+7th in the <a
href="http://www.fh-oow.de/">university of applied sciences</a> in
<a href="http://www.wilhelmshaven.de/">Wilhelmshaven</a>, a city directly
attached to the northern sea.  The event was organised by the local <a
href="http://www.lug-whv.de/">Linux user group</a>.  The Debian
project was able to run a booth and give a talk about Debian as well.</p>

<p>The exhibition took place in the assembly hall and commercial booths were
located in the middle while non-commercial booths were located around them on
the inner side of the wall.  A problem, however, was to determine what kind of
booth it is you are looking at, since they weren't separated well and not all
of them utilised posters properly.</p>

<p>The non-commercial exhibition comprised of booth by LUG WHV, OpenBSD,
Skolelinux, CCO (frisian computer association), Debian, KDE, GNOME and a
mixture of FSF Europe, ffii, KüstenGNU and maybe more.  The KDE, GNOME and CCO
booths were mostly used for hacking.  The CCO brought an SGI Indy and
... tadam ... a VAXstation running Linux for demonstration.  Very nice.  Some
people asked about the VAX port of Debian, sigh...</p>

<p>When I arrived the exhibition looked quite empty, except for the booth staff.
It turned out that this won't change during the entire event.  So most of the
time, exhibitors talked to other exhibitors instead of to interested
visitors.  That's quite sad, especially given the amount of work such an event
required.</p>

<p>On Sunday the event didn't seem to be more crowded than on Saturday, so the
day was quite boring indeed.  Hence, I talked to a lot of other exhibitors.
Talks with Sven Herzberg from GNOME, who works on accessibility in GNOME,
spoke of another bug in xscreensaver which won't be fixed upstream.  They
simply replaced the xlib password dialogue with the GTK dialogue and hence
automatically attached accessibility features of GTK to this program.</p>

<p>It seems that distributions, that want to provide accessibility features
throughout their environments, will have to maintain a lot of additional
patches which won't be accepted upstream, like this example demonstrates.
That'll cause a lot of work for the package maintainers and require a lot of
talk and coordination with upstream and "peer-stream".  That'll be fun in the
future, I guess...</p>
