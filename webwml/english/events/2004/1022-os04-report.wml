<p>The OS04 started quite early: with the ringing of my alarm clock at 4 in the
morning. Granted, I could have gone there later, but then I'd have missed the
keynote from Jon "Maddog" Hall. And that would have been a really bad idea.
Jon came just in time to start his talk on time at 9:30. It was a presentation
on a comparison of Free Software hackers with amateur artists. The lines he
draw and the anecdotes on his first meeting with Linus Torvalds kept the
audience more than just only interested.</p>

<p>Noone dared to interrupt him, not even while he used three times as long as
he was planed to speak. And I guess noone really cared anyway... The rest of
the day the tracks (three side by side) were all delayed by an hour through
that.</p>

<p>I put up my stuff on some table, Michael Prokop told me that I can run a
booth, but I didn't know that I'd be the only one. So I just put up the
LinuxTag DVDs I was sent with the stickers and the flyers there and a little
tray for the people to put donations in and told them to pick what they like
and dip what they want. It worked quite well, and there were quite few who
really asked some stuff. I also had some of the Ayo73 posters left which the
people were quite interested in, of course.</p>

<p>There were a lot of interesting talks, and for the first time I found the
guts to not care for the booth all the time (I from time to time checked for
the donations to not have too much lying there) but also visit some of the
very interesting talks. First has been a talk on The Gimp. I play a bit around
with The Gimp myself, but the practical presentation with nice examples showed
some of the more intersting features.</p>

<p>Dr. Klaus Schmaranz also had a really interesting talk: "Quality Criteria
in Software Projects". He explained it with practical references to some
projects he was involved with. The room was breaking full, and I really can
just recommend to anyone with the chance to visit one of his talks. I'm really
looking forward to his documents, although they'll lose without his talk next
to it but still contain the interesting facts and ideas.</p>

<p>Later then it was time for my own talk. It was about the Debian Project and
how it works, and I guess the people were interested. One person was
especially interested in the <a href="http://cdd.alioth.debian.org/">Custom
Debian Distributions (CDD)</a> because he played with the thought of starting
with <a href="http://debian-enterprise.org/">Debian Enterprise</a> but didn't
know that it already existed. He also asked about if there are some Debian
Developers which are well known (within the Debian world) like Maddog is in
the general Linux community. Named a few, won't name them here or some might
kick me for naming <em>them</em> but not <em>the others</em>....</p>

<p>I'm a bit sad that I couldn't visit the talk at the same time which covered
"Extreme Programming". What one is hearing about it is that its approach is
really helpful.</p>

<p>After this Michael Prokop had his talk about
<a href="http://grml.org/">grml</a> &mdash; Knoppix for System
Administrators</a>. We (yes, I'm part of the grml team) released version 0.1
on the event and from the feedback we got so far the interest for such a
version is quite interesting. It got KDE and OpenOffice removed but added
LaTeX, zsh as default shell and quite some system administrator stuff and geek
tools. Quite some text based tools and lightweight window managers. grml longs
especially for accessibility support because our dear Mario Lang from the
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-accessibility/">Debian Accessibility</a> CDD was
fed up by the not real existent support for blind users in Knoppix. The
current support in grml isn't much better because this is the first release,
but we plan to enhance it quite much.</p>

<p>The day ended with the talk about "A.N.D.I.", a quite interesting project
for architects, to cooperate and collaboration of not only architects but also
with different other professions. Unfortunately due to the one hour delay it
was quite late already and the audience wasn't really there anymore, we were
three people watching a quick explenation of the project. And I must say: it
was a really pity for those <strong>not</strong> having watched it because it
was terrific what they produced already, and the potential that might be
hidden in this project. Unfortunately it is written in java, but well, nothing
is perfect... Maybe it works with
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/kaffe">kaffe</a>.</p>

<p>A long day it was, and a really interesting one. Am looking forward for the
OS05 next year, really. But the most funny thing that happened was while I am
in the train writing this report on my way home: Another traveller with which I shared the train compartment said to me while I already started writing this
and before he left the train: "Know what? You remind me of Schiele, because
you're an artist and also tall and slim..." And I guess Maddog is after all
right: Hacking is compareable to art.<br />

with me instead of my hacking, but you know: there are no
coincidences.)</em></small></p>
