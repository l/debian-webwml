# $Id$

<p>Debian recently attended (20th and 21st April) the Debian at Linux
User and Developer Expo (LUDEX) show in the London Olympia
hall. Debian was represented by several UK developers who ran the
stand on both days, special mention should be made of Steve McIntyre
who did most of the co-ordination and organisation.</p>

<p>The stand was well setup and arranged and we presented a very
professional appearance to the public. The stand space was part of the
.org village sponsored by UKLinux.net. There were the usual T shirts
and polo shirts on sale as well as Debian in numerous flavours, the
less common discs could be cut to order as Steve had production
facility's on the stand.</p>

<p>Alongside the main Debian stand was the emDebian group showing
embedded uses of Debian this group had a wide selection of devices and
attracted a lot of attention in their own right.</p>

<p>On the evening of the first days exhibiting UKLinux.net also held a
party which was well attended by almost all of the .org village. Our
newly reelected leader was asked to give a short speech in which he
discussed the issue of software patents and outlined the imminent
release schedule for Debian sarge release.</p>

<p>The event was somewhat less busy than the previous expo at <a
href="http://wiki.earth.li/DebianExpoList2003">olympia</a> but there
were still enough people to make it worthwhile.</p>
