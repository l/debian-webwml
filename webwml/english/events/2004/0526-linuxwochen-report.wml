# $Id$

<p>Another year, another Linuxwochen. The third time this event toured through
Austria, and of course we had a booth again. It is astounding how big and
worth a visit the event has become in that short time. This year we even had
four days full of interesting program.</p>


<h3>Wednesday, 26th of May: Desktop Day</h3>

<p>The setup of the booths and the whole event started on Wednesday early
morning. When I came there between 8:00 and 9:00 morning some early birds were
already mostly done with the network setup in the rented MuseumsQuartier. But
I was still of help for some parts of it.</p>

<p>The other booth staff members showed up also in time and helped, too. The
posters that Ayo of 73lab.com did and Credativ printed came exactly in time
for the event, so we had something for the people. Also the handouts were
here.</p>

<p>The event started at 13:00 and people showed up in time. There were booths
from Sun, IBM, Novell and some local companies which were quite interesting.
The talks were mainly about the business desktop and related topics which gave
the day its special name.</p>

<p>Someone asked me to help them with the install of Mandrake on their
notebook. Well, the auto hardware detection seems to have frozen the system, so I
added noauto. Well, then they had problem with configuring their X server,
because no auto detection was done... The mouse wasn't configured. And the
best part was: Somehow the guys managed to get a broken passwd file! The user
they started with had both the shell and the home directory set to crap ("._"
or such...). After I've changed that to sensible defaults they were finally
able to use their Mandrake. I guess even the old boot floppies weren't able to
produce such strange problems.</p>

<p>A little later Werner came along with his PA-RISC machine again, and also
one of the sparc machines that Krisztian Mark Szentes donated to us. The story
from last year with the PA-RISC was continued because he had a harddisk
failure and needed to install it again. But this time it wasn't that hard. The
bigger problem has been the IPX which had problems with the mouse, but they
managed it in time for the end of the Linuxwochen with joined forces. :)</p>

<p>The day was finished with some vino tasting. Was quite nice, especially
sitting around with all the people and talking about various different
topics.</p>


<h3>Thursday, 27th of May: Business to Business and Authorities Day</h3>

<p>This time we started in the morning with the talks, and the place was already a
little bit crowded when I came there. The Sun Java Desktop System talk sounded
at least partly interesting, wasn't in there for too long, though. Wanted to
work on my talk I had to hold on the next day, but I was given one of those
"Guru" stickers which means that people are free to ask me whenever they came
along. Those stickers were a great idea, and almost all of our booth personnel
did have such a sticker.</p>


<h3>Friday, 28th of May: Technology Day</h3>

<p>In the morning the booth area had to be reorganized because the first two
days were business oriented and thus had more business exhibitors, and the
coming two were more community oriented. The OpenOffice.org crew moved apart
and made space for the Perl people and the Jux project, from where I got my
own Jux CD now. It's always nice to have one of the things that have your name
in the booklet....</p>

<p>Watched the keynote about Copyright and Free Software, which has been held
by Cory Doctorow of the EFF. It was really interesting, and I hope it will be
made available online too, like the talks of the former two days.</p>

<p>The third day had technology as main topic, and my talk fit in quite well.
It was my third talk in my "mal anders" (somehow differently) series, and this
time it was about Debian packaging. I started off with alien and handling
of binary only distributed files with debhelper, and continued with the format
of a deb package and how to make changes to an already packaged deb. I have
put the magic point sources onto my homepage already, but they are only
available in German language for now. Maybe I will repeat that talk at the
LinuxTag, if people raise interest. That would be in English language then,
I guess &mdash; so chances are good that I will have to rewrite it anyway.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a political talk with representatives of all four
parties of the Austrian government. The main mentioned topic has been of
course software patents (which are mainly patents on ideas and not technology)
and the upcoming vote for the EU parliament. It has been quite interesting,
though at least the person sent by the SPÖ was not too well informed.</p>

<p>After that there was the hacknight done by the CNGW like every year. I
didn't want to stay all night long, but they showed some films and I hacked
along all night long...</p>


<h3>Saturday, 29th of May: User Day</h3>

<p>I have been almost the first &mdash; only Stefan Heinecke has been here
earlier. We were much too early because the first talk started at eleven o'
clock. It was the only talk I watched completely, also helped with the
technique at the beginning: The notebook had problems with the beamer so some
replacement was needed, and found. The talk was about "Open Mind goes
OpenSource (OMGOS)" and presented an online training platform looked really
promising.</p>

<p>Sven Guckes was placed into the secondary talk room with his "Vim Feature
Show", but got the room completely full, like always. And also again he had
some hardware problems to solve at the start but got the people still happy
during that time with his show. He is always a great magnet for audience.</p>

<p>After trying to help some person with his WinXP notebook and wlan problem
the event was more or less finished in the later afternoon. There were some
talks left, but the exhibition area was less and less crowded, and the
dismantling started. The funny part: I was leaving with more handouts that I
was sent, because Christoph Siess had quite a huge box left also from some
former event and didn't want to take them all home with himself.</p>

<p>In the evening there was again some finishing show: This time it had been
"Hacktivity": In three rounds starting with a Binary Search (where people have
to ask the audience yes/no kind questions and they have to applaud if the
answer is yes) on geek terms. Second round is called Pattern Matching where
the candidate has to act as mime and the other candidates have to guess, and
third round was Binary Search again. I was one of the candidates, and failed
miserably right on the first term, which was "magic code", #! or hash bang.
One has 256 seconds to guess, and I wasn't able to find it. I thought already
that I am completely wrong here, but then the others weren't able to perform
any better.</p>

<p>In the end I made it as first through the game and was given an OpenBSD 3.5
CD set, and could choose from an OpenBSD girlie shirt, an OpenBSD baseball cap
an OpenBSD poster and an "Posthörnchen" shirt. Of course I took the latter.
The others have received older versions of OpenBSD and will have to patch
their openssh if they plan to install it. :-)</p>


<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The event has been a great success: There were no talks in the exhibition
area anymore and this was a huge improvement over the former year. From
reading this report you might guess that I was asked about everything but
Debian. That isn't true, quite many people have asked of course about Debian
&mdash; but I guess those things are the ones that you keep in mind. Many
people asked about our debian.at t-shirts but we didn't have any this year
unfortunately. We will really have to do some for the next year again. Also
quite many questions were about the sarge release and I pointed them to the
debian-vote list for watching the upcoming vote. And at least two people asked
me (I am not sure if it was really in connection with my talk or not) on how
to get their own packages into the pool. I directed those to the
debian-mentors list.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to the next year, and am already starting to think
about the topic of my next "mal anders" talk. Lets see what comes along, I
have one topic in mind and hope that I will get enough input for it so I'll be
able to do it.</p>
