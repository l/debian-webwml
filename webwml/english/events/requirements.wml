#use wml::debian::template title="Booth requirements"

<p>There have been numerous problems with the organization of booths
in the past.  This document aims to shed some light upon the issue.

<p>First of all, the Debian Project does not have any money to spend
on exhibitions, especially not on returnables (such as space, carpets,
tables etc.).  As a result the project needs to get the entire booth
sponsored by the organizers and not just space in order to run a
proper and well staffed booth.

<p>Secondly, everything that is shown on a Debian booth on an
exhibition is loaned from individuals or companies who provide a means
of support to us.  All equipment is maintained by Debian people who
are interested in running that booth.  All expenses, be it lodging or
travelling, are paid by these individuals out of their own pocket.
All other expenses that make the booth look interesting (i.e. banners,
posters, t-shirts etc.) are also paid by individuals.

<p>This means that when providing only space for a booth, the booth
would look very poor, since no electricity would mean that computers
won't be able to display anything (since electricity is needed to
power the machines and monitors), or only laptops could be used, but
they can store power for no longer than four hours.  Additionally it
also means that people, who would staff the booth, will actually have
to sit on the naked floor if nobody provides tables, chairs and a
carpet.

<p>In short, such a booth would be look very poor.  It is quite
questionable whether this would demonstrate the high level of an
exhibition, poor project or display that the organizers don't have
money or don't want to spend money on free software projects.

<p>After all, such free software projects create the products what the organizers
get paid for.  Without all those projects that provide this wonderful
free software, there won't be conferences covering this very software.
There also won't be many companies that base their business on this
type of software.  Taking this into account, where is the problem for
conference organizers to provide a fully fledged booth for these
projects?  How much is $500 to spend for one booth for a company that
take in an entrance fee for a single person which is more than this?
