<define-tag intro>

<p>The Italian Debian Community Conference is the common place where
all Italian users, translators and developers discuss and share ideas
and knowledge about Debian.  It is meant to be open to any kind of
contributions, being an event organized by the community for the
community itself.</p>

<p>Several Debian developers will give talks about the Debian 
philosophy and how to contribute to the project.  The Italian localization team 
will be around to talk about translation effort and tools. Many users 
will show common cases of daily work with Debian or present specific pieces 
of software. A keysigning party is planned for Sunday.</p>
