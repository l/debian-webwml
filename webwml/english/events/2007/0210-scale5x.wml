<p>The annual Southern California Linux Expo (or SCALE for
short) is a conference about Free Software in general, trying to bring
academic institutions, business and the GNU/Linux Community together.
There will be an exhibition and a conference track. Attendees should
register in advance and are allowed to vote for the SCALE award
honouring best speakers, booths, products and projects.</p>
