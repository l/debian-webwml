    <p>Debian developers will attend the congress and will be staff
    a booth.  Many
    Spanish developers will attend, additional demonstrations around
    Debian will take place using the booth's computers. Some other
    surprises will be given out to people attending the booth.

    <p>On one of the days (to be determined) a Birds of a Feather 
    meeting will take place. All Debian developers attending will 
    be present and, after a brief presentation of the Debian project,
    it will be time for questions. The talk will be, as usual, be
    directed towards the issues demanded by the audience.

    <p>Some of the talks in the congress will be related to Debian as well
    since they will present services or developments based on the Debian
    GNU/Linux operating system.

    <p>Time has been allocated to key signing, giving participants a
    chance to meet other developers in person while extending and
    strengthening the Web of Trust.
