<define-tag intro>

    <a href="http://congreso.hispalinux.es/">Hispalinux Congress</a> 
    (Hispalinux 2002) is an annual meeting of free software users and
    developers and the most important Linux conference in Spain. The
    conference is organized by
    <a href="http://www.hispalinux.es/">Hispalinux</a>,
    the largest association of GNU/Linux users in Spain. The congress is
    oriented towards presentation of news and development of GNU/Linux
    and other free software projects.  It gives an opportunity to
    developers and investigators to publish the results of their work.

<define-tag involve>

    <p>Debian developers will attend the congress and will be staff
    a booth.  Many
    Spanish developers will attend, additional demonstrations around
    Debian will take place using the booth's computers. Some other
    surprises will be given out to people attending the booth.

    <p>On one of the days (to be determined) a Birds of a Feather 
    meeting will take place. All Debian developers attending will 
    be present and, after a brief presentation of the Debian project,
    it will be time for questions. The talk will be, as usual,
    directed towards the issues demanded by the audience.

    <p>Some of the talks in the congress will be related to Debian as well
    since they will present services or developments based on the Debian
    GNU/Linux operating system.

    <p>Time has been allocated to key signing, giving participants a
    chance to meet other developers in person while extending and
    strengthening the Web of Trust.
