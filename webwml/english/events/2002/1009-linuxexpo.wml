<define-tag intro>

    The market for Linux products and services is growing rapidly as
    an increasing number of organisations adopt the open source
    operating system for their IT infrastructure. Now in it's third
    year, the UK Linux Expo is the definitive forum for everyone
    involved in this Open Source revolution. Linux Expo 2002 brings
    together the major vendors who supply Linux tools, support,
    applications and servers with the users, influencers and
    decision-makers responsible for implementing Linux based systems.
