<define-tag intro>

    <p>From passion to profession:
  
    <a href="http://www.webb.it/">Webb.it</a> is the largest italian
    meeting about computers and technology for hobbyists and
    professionals alike. Webb.it is an event dedicated to software
    development and programming, web design and graphics, new media,
    hardware, networking and even marketing and business.

    <p>About 1000 "resident" participants will attend Webb.it with their
    computers, to live and sleep in the Arena, always connected to the
    high-speed intranet, with a 156Mbits connection to the
    internet. Others will be there to attend some of the more than 300
    workshops or to just hang around in the area outside of the arena
    where the sponsors and various companies will have their booths.

<define-tag involve>

    <p>Debian will be present with some space in the Free Software booth
    (outside of the arena) and with an "island" inside the arena. The
    island will be designated by a 4m tall totem with Debian spirals on
    it (and some posters with information about Debian activities at the
    Webb.it.)

    <p>Some Debian developers and entusiasts will be at the show to install
    GNU/Linux on visitors' machines and help anybody wishing to switch
    from proprietary to free software. After a long time this is
    another opportunity to put names and email addresses to faces and
    personalities.
