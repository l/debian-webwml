 "Think-Linux: The Solutions Show" will be the first exhibition
 focused mainly on end-user applications of Linux rather than on
 software developers. The two-day event, scheduled for October 30-31,
 2002 at The Pinnacle in Maumee, Ohio, (same location as Linux @ the
 Office, in 2000, and 2001) and will be of interest to any
 organization facing mission-critical information technology
 decisions.
