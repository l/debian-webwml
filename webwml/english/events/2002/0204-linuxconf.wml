<define-tag intro>

    <p>Linux.conf.au 2002 is Australia's national Linux conference.
    It will be held at the <a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/">University
    of Queensland</a>, Brisbane, Australia, from 6th to 9th February 2002.
    It is the third conference of its kind, following the outstanding
    successes that were <a
    href="http://www.linux.org.au/projects/calu/">CALU 1999</a> in
    Melbourne and LCA 2001 in Sydney.</p>

    <p>The Debian mini Conference at LCA 2002 is a small gathering of
    various Debian developers and users in the region, directly
    preceeding the Australian national Linux conference.  It will take
    place from 4th to 5th of February.</p>

    maintainer), plus others as they arise.  This is being run as a
