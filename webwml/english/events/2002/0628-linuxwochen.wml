<define-tag intro>

  You can take this as a roadshow that wanders through several
  districts of Austria.  There will be different presentations,
  workshops and discussions with topics on Free Software and related
  subjects.  LinuxWochen will last longer than just from 28th to 30th
  in general, but that is the time when it will be in Vienna.

    The Debian project will be represented in Vienna with a booth run
    by Gerfried Fuchs.  He is also planning to give a talk about
    package management in Debian in general.
