# $Id$

<p> The expo took place in a part of hall 6 at the Frankfurt Messe
from Tuesday, Oct. 29th till Thursday, Oct. 31st.</p>

<h2>Booth building-up</h2>

<p>Building the booth wasn't that easy as you might think. We had
some problems finding someone who could bring all the hardware to the
exhibition area. Luckily, Jan Haas offered his help and his car.</p>

<p>When arriving at the booth, we were a little bit irritated,
because our booth had only one wall, while Alex thought all the time
we would have two walls.  So he threw away his plan, moved the
furniture we got, and after two hours we had a nice looking booth.</p>

<p>The biggest problem was to get a beamer. Although we found in Achim
Lange from Network Appliance someone who could lend us one, we where
unable to get it to the exhibition area (Achim got ill suddenly being
unable to bring the beamer himself). But finally we got it, and
against Alex' fears that nobody would see anything on the dark gray
walls, it looked very good.</p>

<h2>The Booth</h2>

<p>We were really far off, the booth most distant from the entrance in
a corner. On the other hand just opposite of us was the Credativ booth
with Michael Meskes and No&euml;l K&ouml;the, who equipped us with CDs and
flyers and came over for a chat from time to time. As the booth only
had one wall, we could not put too many posters there, the beamer was
using most of it. We had to share one DSL connection with the whole
.org-Pavilion, but most of the time it worked out. Two notebooks on a
small table and one desktop in the corner equipped the booth, the
beamer was plugged into one of the notebooks. All computers were
i386.</p>

<h2>The Staff</h2>

<p>Alexander Schmehl, J&ouml;rg Jaspert, Chris Halls and Michael Banck
where at the booth most of the time. Daniel Priem was at the booth all
day on Tuesday, Rene Engelhard helped out on Wednesday afternoon and
Erik Tews showed up for a short time on Tuesday afternoon, too. As
noted above, Noël came over several times for a chat and was talking
to visitors, too.</p>

<h2>The Visitors</h2>

<p>Naturally, there was a quite changing flux of visitors at our
booth.  Most of the time, one or two of us were not in conversation
and able to read mail or have a look around at the other booths. There
were some longer periods with no visitors at all (towards the evenings
usually) and sometimes the booth was swamped with people...</p>

<p>There where several types of people coming to our booth:</p>

<ul>
<li>People from corporations or public administration who screened every
    project, asking us: 'So, what's special about, uhm,  Debian?' I told
    them general stuff about 'stable', security.debian.org, non-free !=
    Debian and so on.
</li>
<li>Similar people as above, but asking like: 'So, I've heard Debian has
    excellent security updates. How does that work?' They were quite
    nice to talk to, the conversation was quite technically usually.
</li>
<li>Staff from other booths like AMD or Sun going: 'Well, we have to use
    SuSE|Red Hat at work, but at home I've got Debian running of course.
    Great work!' They usually stayed for a small chat and/or SuSE-
    bashing.
</li>
<li>Staff from other booths who asked for specific Debian-related stuff.
    For example, an Oracle employee who was put at the SuSE booth once
    came over asking if Oracle ran on Debian, and what he could tell
    his customers unofficially if they asked for Debian. An AMD employee
    told me he'd loved to see an Opteron port of Debian and was
    discussing 64bit versus 32bit user-space a bit with me.
</li>
<li>Regular users who apparently didn't know Debian too well, took a CD
    and left.
</li>
<li>Regular Debian users who applauded us for our work and usually
    stayed quite a while asking all kinds of general questions and/or
    telling stories about their use of Debian/Linux (blocking
    conversation with other, still-to-be-converted people sometimes). One
    of them even wanted our autographs on his newly-bought LinuxTag
    Debian CD-Set...
</li>
<li>Regular Debian users with very specific questions that we tried to
    answer. One of them asked how to install some obscure variant of an
    alpha box which needs a custom kernel or something, for example.
</li>
<li>Celebrities. Klaus Knopper, the guy behind the famous Knoppix
    Live-CD visited our booth on Wednesday IIRC. He showed how to
    install Knoppix permanently on a hardisk and experienced a Debian
    install for the first time ever. J&ouml;rg Schilling was at our
    booth for a long time on Wednesday and Thursday, explaining his
    smake build system and some of his other programs to J&ouml;rg (and Michael,
    when he was able to listen). Very interesting.  Frank Ronneburg, author of
    the 'Debian GNU/Linux Anwenderhandbuch' and Ralf Nolden, KDevelop
    maintainer and recent Debian convert were the other celebrities.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Stuff</h2>

<p>We had flyers and LinuxTag-CDs. Some people asked for posters or
T-Shirts, but I think they were too few that it would have been worth
the effort (I bought an FSF shirt though). Virtually nobody gave any
donations in exchange for CDs, it's a business thing after all. We ran
out of CDs sometime on Thursday, burning blank CDs for interested
visitors with J&ouml;rg's burner. But Michael Meskes still has 700
Flyers left.  Oh, and LinuxLand 'donated' some PC-case stickers with a
Debian swirl to the developers, after some talking-in.</p>

<h2>The Beamer</h2>

<p>Most of the time on Tuesday and Wednesday the beamer was used to
show off 'bb' as a screen-saver. Alexander Schmehl walked a couple of
visitors through the installation on Wednesday and Thursday which
caught the interest of other visitors even more :) Perhaps we should
put a sign 'Installation demonstrations on demand' somewhere at the
booth next time, I think it was a very nice demonstration.</p>

<h2>The Social Event/The Evenings</h2>

<p>The so called &quot;Linux World get together Party&quot; was a good
and well organized party! Sponsored by AMD, the organizers rented the
basement of the "R&ouml;mer" (that is where our city government
resides, not cheap), and rented some buses to bring us there from the
exhibition area. Of course they hired a very good party service, which
made a very good buffet. Food and drinks were for free, and the only
rub of it was the music.  I think the DJ wanted to finish early, so he
played his music with increasing loudness ;)</p>

<h2>The Conclusion</h2>

<p>I was really happy with the expo. Our booth seemed to be one of the
most frequented of the .org pavilion. I was able to talk to a lot of
interested and interesting persons during the time, as well as
chatting with the fellow developers and users. I think every single
person I've talked to who knew Debian already was very positive about
it, some seemed to have come because of our booth alone. The ones who
didn't know about it seemed to be at least a little bit impressed.</p>
