    The Debian project will be present with a booth in the area reserved to
    community projects, which is being provided free of charge by 
    the organisers.  At the booth Debian developers will be 
    available to ask all your issues related to Debian, and sign
    keys, also some small talks will be held there (on the new maintainer process,
    package creation, etc.).  There may be  other
    surprises as well.

    <p>A BoF meeting will be held on April 30th (starting at 14:00h)
    in which all Spanish developers (or mostly all) answer to
    (try to) solve the questions that users pose in the forum.
