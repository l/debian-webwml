<define-tag intro>
The Linux/Unix Users' Group of Virginia Tech, located in Blacksburg, Va.,
is holding a Linux/*BSD InstallFest.  We'll be installing from 10:30 AM
till 3:30 PM on Saturday, December 5th, 1998.  The InstallFest will be
located in Brush Mountain Room B in Squires Student Center (the university
student union building, a.k.a. SUB) on the campus of Virginia Tech.

<p>
After the InstallFest is over, we'll be holding a networked Quake demo
with the Va. Tech Gaming Association while others clean up.  Everything 
must be over and done with and gone by 5:30 PM.

<p>
Everyone is welcome to watch or play Quake after 3:30 PM, but until then
we'll only admit people getting or working on installations.  There will
be security at the door (I'm in charge of that :^), so expect to have to
show some ID when you check in with your hardware.  We want to protect
your computer and ours from theft or tampering.

<p>
We plan to install Debian, Red Hat, Slackware, perhaps SuSE and/or
Caldera, and also FreeBSD, with perhaps NetBSD or OpenBSD if there is
demand.  We have installation experts for the above lined up already, as
well as most of the networking and server hardware we'll need to pull
this off.

<p>
We expect to serve between 15 and 21 installs in five hours.  We're
intentionally planning for a modest number here since this is an Alpha
InstallFest (our first for everybody involved except one).  We want to
get the OS installed along with apps such as Netscape, Midnight Commander,
and easy dial-up networking apps (we're thinking of chat scripting right
now, although we might do xisp).  We need to teach basic start-up,
shut-down, and sysadmin procedures and the basic use of X and the
dial-up modem connection before we shoo people out the door to play
with their new OS :^)

<p>
There is no URL as of now, but that will be fixed by next week when
our webmaster will have a few free moments.  Our current crappy web
site (master) is located at http://www.vt.edu:10021/org/linux/.

<p>
Pre-registration is *mandatory* and can be done in person or by
downloading the application/waiver form from the web site (once it's
up) and e-mailing it in.  The application contact person is Rob Nelson
<ronelson@vt.edu>.  I'm the secondary contact, Clemmitt Sigler
<csigler@vt.edu>.  No pre-registration, no installation, no exceptions.
We have to know what hardware and how many installs to expect.  We
will turn away overflow crowds and point them to our Spring InstallFest.

<p>
For directions, email Rob or myself.  Generally, we're located about
35 miles SW of Roanoke, Virginia, about 50 miles east of Bluefiled, West
Virginia, and about 200 miles ENE of Knoxville, Tennessee.  We're located
conveniently close to US Interstate 81, on US Route 460.  Check out

Debian would like to contribute some CDs for this event, and, if possible,
have some people to help install and demonstrate Debian on hand.
