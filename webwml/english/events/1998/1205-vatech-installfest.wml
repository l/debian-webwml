<define-tag intro>
The Linux/Unix Users' Group of Virginia Tech, located in Blacksburg, Va.,
is holding a Linux/*BSD InstallFest.  We'll be installing from 10:30 AM
till 3:30 PM on Saturday, December 5th, 1998.  The InstallFest will be
located in Brush Mountain Room B in Squires Student Center (the university
student union building, a.k.a. SUB) on the campus of Virginia Tech.

<p>
An InstallFest is a one day event where PC owners can bring their
systems in to a central location to have an alternate operating system
installed for a "test-drive."  In most cases, Linux, FreeBSD, etc., can be
installed on a user's hard drive and the system configured so that s/he can
"dual-boot" to both WindowsTM and the new OS.  That way you can try out Linux
or BSD without losing the ability to run WindowsTM while you're still
learning about your new OS.

<p>
We plan to install Debian, Red Hat, Slackware, perhaps SuSE and Caldera,
and also FreeBSD, with perhaps NetBSD or OpenBSD if there is demand.
We expect to perform between 15 and 21 installations in five hours.

<p>
Pre-registration is *mandatory* and can be done in person or by downloading
the application/waiver form and e-mailing it in.  The application contacts are
Rob Nelson &lt;<a href="mailto:ronelson@vt.edu">ronelson@vt.edu</a>&gt;
and 
Clemmitt Sigler &lt;<a href="mailto:csigler@vt.edu">csigler@vt.edu</a>&gt;.  No
pre-registration, no installation, no exceptions.  We have to know what
hardware and how many installs to expect.  Note that installation availability
is on a first-come, first-served basis, so please apply early!  We will turn
away overflow crowds and point them to our Spring InstallFest.

<p>
You should plan to present identification at the door and check in and out of
the InstallFest room itself because we want to ensure security for people who
bring their PCs to the InstallFest.  Our two main goals are professional,
easy-to-use OS installations and protection of the hardware people bring to
the event for an installation or loan to L/UUG of VT for our use.

<p>
For directions, e-mail us.  Generally, we're located about 35 miles SW of
Roanoke, Virginia, about 50 miles east of Bluefield, West Virginia, and about
200 miles ENE of Knoxville, Tennessee.  We're located conveniently close to US
Interstate 81, on US Route 460.  Check out www.mapsonus.com to pull up maps of
the region around Blacksburg, Va.

<p>
After the InstallFest is over, we'll be holding a networked Quake demo
with the Va. Tech Gaming Association while others clean up.  Everyone is
welcome to watch or play Quake after 3:30 PM, but until then we'll only admit
people getting or working on installations.  Everything must be over and done
with and gone by 5:30 PM.  We hope to see you there!

Debian would like to contribute some CDs for this event, and, if possible,
have some people to help install and demonstrate Debian on hand.
