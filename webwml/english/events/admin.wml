<p>Whenever members of the Debian project attend an event (conference,
exhibition or similar) it should be made public in time so other
people, especially our users, get a chance to meet project members,
core developers and other experienced users.

<p>In order to make such events public we need to get informed about
them.  We will create an entry on our <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events
page</a> for every event the project participates.  We will try to
release a news posting to our <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-news">news list</a> a couple of
days before the event covering this event and the type of
participation. (Since we tend to forget about this, you'd better
remind us.)

<p>We maintain a list of <a
href="http://www.infodrom.ffis.de/Debian/events/calendar.html">upcoming
attractions</a>, however, it may be incomplete.  Also, only events
will be added to our <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events page</a> when
Debian participation is guaranteed.  We are not going to provide a
general events calendar on www.debian.org.
