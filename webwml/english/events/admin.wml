<p>The events Team coordinates the use of the small amount of shared
resources used by organizers of debian presence at events, gives out help
and advice in organizing debian presences on request and cares about the
Events web pages and (among others) the events wiki pages.
</p>

<p>Above mentioned email address may be used to contact the events team 
directly, but ideally members of the events team should read 
debian-events-*@lists.debian.org mailinglists. (This is not true at the 
moment as far as I can see.)
