<p>Whenever members of the Debian project attend an event (conference,
exhibition or similar) it should be made public in time so other
people, especially our users, get a chance to meet project members,
core developers and other experienced users.
</p>

<p>In order to make such events public we need to get informed about
them.  We will create an entry on our <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events
page</a> for every event the project participates.  We will try to
release a news posting to our <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-news/">news list</a> a couple of
days before the event covering this event and the type of
participation. (Since we tend to forget about this, you'd better
remind us.)
</p>

<p>
Events will only be added to our own <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events page</a>
when Debian participation is guaranteed.  We are not going to provide a
general events calendar on www.debian.org but you can find some general
Free Sofware events calendars at the
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/events/all.html">FSF</a>,
<a href="http://www.fsfe.org/events/">FSFE</a> and
<a href="http://lwn.net/Calendar/">LWN</a>
websites.
