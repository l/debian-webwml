<h3>Jobs for events@debian.org</h3>

<p>Whenever members of the Debian project attend an event (conference,
exhibition or similar) it should be made public in time so other
people, especially our users, get a chance to meet project members,
core developers and other experienced users.

<p>In order to make such events public we need to get informed about
them.  We will create an entry on our <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events
page</a> for every event the project participates.  We will try to
release a news posting to our <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-news">news list</a> a couple of
days before the event covering this event and the type of
participation. (Since we tend to forget about this, you'd better
remind us.)

<p>We maintain a list of <a
href="http://www.infodrom.ffis.de/Debian/events/calendar.html">upcoming
attractions</a>, however, it may be incomplete.  Also, only events
will be added to our <a href="$(HOME)/events/">events page</a> when
Debian participation is guaranteed.  We are not going to provide a
general events calendar on www.debian.org.

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>The Debian project provides two mailing lists for coordinating
events:

<p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-events-eu">debian-events-eu</a>,
       dedicated to Europe and european events.
  <li> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/#debian-events-na">debian-events-na</a>,
       dedicated to Northern America and events on that continent.
</ul>

<p>To subscribe to either of these lists, check out our <a
href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">subscription page</a>.

<h3>Running a booth</h3>

<p>The most important task for project members to represent the Debian
project on an exhibition is to run a booth for Debian.  This is quite
easy since it is sufficient for a simple booth to hook up a machine
running Debian GNU/Linux and somebody explaining things.  It is,
however, recommended that at least two people staff the booth and you
use posters and flyers along with some more machines.

<p>For many events, people have created additional web pages and
mailing lists to help them plan and run the booth.  Please check the
links to ``coordination'' on our pages for upcoming and past events to
get an idea about this.
