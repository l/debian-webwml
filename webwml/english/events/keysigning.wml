#use wml::debian::template title="Keysigning"

<p>Since a lot of developers meet at trade shows or conferences they
have become a nice way to get other people sign ones GnuPG key and
improve the web of trust.  Especially for people who are new to the
project, keysigning and meeting other developers has been very
interesting.

<p>The following list intends to help you with running a keysigning
session.

<ul>

<li> You need printed out GnuPG fingerprints and an identity card to
     prove your identity (passport, drivers license or similar).

<li> The fingerprints are given to other people who ought to sign your
     key after the meeting.

<li> If you don't have a GnuPG key yet, create one with <code>gpg --gen-key</code>.

<li> Only sign a key if the identity of the person whose key to sign
     is proven.

<li> After the meeting you'll have to fetch the GnuPG key in order to
     sign it.  The following may help:

<pre>
       gpg --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys 0xDEADBEAF
</pre>

<li> To sign the key, enter the edit menu with

<pre>
       gpg --edit-key 0xDEADBEAF
</pre>

<li> In GnuPG select all uids to sign with <code>uid n</code>.

<li> To sign a key, enter <code>sign</code>.  You will then be shown
     the fingerprint of they key which you have to compare with the
     one you've got from the person you met.

<li> Quit GnuPG with <code>quit</code>

</ul>
