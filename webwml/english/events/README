This directory contains files and documentation of events which the
Debian Projects attends in one way or the other.  Coordination of
these events is normally done through one of the following mailing
list (depending on which one seems to be more appropriate).

Europe ......: debian-events-eu@lists.debian.org

North America: debian-events-na@lists.debian.org

Bay Area ....: bad@bad.debian.net

UK ..........: debian-uk@chiark.greenend.org.uk

If not coordinated through a mailing list, it may be helpful to copy
mails to events@debian.org (Joey gets these mails and an archive on
master for future reference).

Now the important part:

DO NOT ADD FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY OR ITS SUBDIRECTORIES!

Only those people who take care of all events that Debian attends, are
allowed to add files here.  The reason is quite simple, if
events@debian.org isn't aware of events, doesn't know when and what is
added here, things will eventually be forgotten, which is not
helpful.

Even worse to that, people who are not used to adding files and
content here, add bad content (bad style, broken tags, missing
information, wrong information etc.).  It has been shown in the past
that this was bad, so please honor this file and contact
events@debian.org instead.


You are, however, invited to fix spelling errors or bad code in
existing files.
