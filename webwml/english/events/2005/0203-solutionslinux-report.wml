<p>Solutions Linux Paris was held from February, 1st to February, 3rd
at the CNIT in Paris-La Défense. This year again, we were offered a
booth in the .Org Pavillion.</p>

<p>The people manning the booth this year were (in no particular
order) Christian Perrier, Sven Luther, Bill Allombert, Jean-Michel
Kelbert, Raphaël Hertzog, Cédric Delfosse, Ludovic Drolez, Frédéric
Peters, Niv Altivanik, Aurélien Gérôme, Nicolas Pétillon, Frédéric
Lehobey, Géraud Gratacap, Nadine St-Amand and myself.</p>

<p>Other Debian developers were present at the exhibition, representing their
companies: Benjamin Drieu and Arnaud Quette. Sam Hocevar, Thomas Seyrat
and Jérôme Marant popped by to say hello.</p>

<p>Our booth this year was really great, thanks to all the people who
offered their help, and thanks to our kind sponsors. Actually, it's
been our best booth since the first edition of this exhibition.</p>

<h3>"When will Sarge be released?"</h3>

<p>We've been asked this question numerous times, just as last
year. Fortunately, we could explain to our visitors that Sarge was
really close to release, and what steps needed to be taken before the
release.</p>

<p>As it happens, our users have, for a great majority, switched to
Sarge already, despite the lack of security support. Home users mostly
don't care about it that much (although some do care), and enterprise
users are spending time tracking the security updates in unstable,
then updating their snapshost of Sarge.</p>

<p>Not all enterprise users are pleased with this situation, but they
greatly prefer doing it that way rather than using Woody or switching
to another distribution. Woody backports aren't considered a good
enough solution by most of them.</p>


<h3>l10n/i18n in debian-installer</h3>

<p>Christian Perrier brought Babelbox, a demonstration machine that
reinstalls itself automatically using debian-installer, running the
installation in a different language at each iteration.</p>

<p>This demonstration was a great success; it demonstrated the ability
of debian-installer to perform unattended installations, and the high
level of i18n/l10n attained by the installer and the whole system.</p>

<p>For Bill Allombert, this has been the chance to check that the menu
package he maintains was working correctly under the different
languages.</p>


<h3>"How to support Debian for our products?"</h3>

<p>A few companies came to ask us how a company can support Debian for
their products. The real questions are what version to support and who to
contact for some key points of the system (most notably, the
kernel). Christian Perrier <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/">posted</a> these
questions on debian-devel during the exhibition.</p>

<p>As it happens, software vendors have a growing need to support
Debian for their products. In France, some ministries are requiring
Debian support in their invitations to tender; this is a growing
tendency.</p>


<h3>Technical questions</h3>

<p>The exhibition is the occasion for our users to come and ask
precise technical questions to the developers on the booth.</p>

<p>This year again, we've had our share of questions, with varying
degrees of complexity. We were able to answer all the questions we were
asked, leading to some really interesting discussions with our
users.</p>


<h3>Documentation, translation</h3>

<p>A retired documentation translator came to the booth, asking
questions about support for the Sagem Fast 800 ADSL modem (a USB piece
of crap, supported by the eagle-usb-* packages).</p>

<p>The discussion went on to the availability and quality of the
translated documentation. It might be an evidence to some, but you
cannot translate a technical documentation if you don't master the
languages (original and target) and the subject of the
documentation.</p>

<p>We came to the conclusion that a real effort was needed in this
area; this isn't exactly new, but the situation might be worse than
some of us imagined.</p>


<h3>Non-i386 architectures</h3>

<p>Sven Luther brought a Pegasos machine, so we could demonstrate
Linux on non-Apple PowerPC machines. Equipped with two blue neons, this
shiny machine attracted quite a few visitors. Unfortunately, as our
plans to takeover the PLF (Mandrake) booth next to our booth failed,
we couldn't put his machine on the front of the booth ;)</p>

<p>As it happens, more and more users are interested in non-i386
architectures, mainly to run Debian on Apple and amd64 machines. Lots
of people (including companies) asked for the amd64 port, and couldn't
understand why it isn't part of our official archive yet. Explaining
Debian's internal political issues isn't that easy.</p>


<h3>Popularity</h3>

<p>Despite what can be read here and there, we're still one of the
most popular distribution out of there. We heard about a lot of scary
experiences with other distributions, too ;)</p>


<h3>Thanks</h3>

<p>Thanks go to the following people or companies for their support
and their help in getting our booth to a state where it was actually
far better than some of the commercial ones:</p>
<ul>
  <li>HP and Jean-Marie Verdun, for the 3 demo machines</li>
  <li>ONERA (the French Aeronautics and Space Research Center), for
      allowing Christian Perrier to attend the exhibition and bring
      two machines, Babelbox and our mirror server</li>
  <li>Linux Magazine France, for shipping the posters once again and
      for giving us 100 Sarge DVDs</li>
  <li>Linbox, for sponsoring our flyers, and allowing Cédric Delfosse
      and Ludovic Drolez to join us on the booth. Thank you
      Sébastien.</li>
  <li>Denis Bodor (Linux Magazine France editor), for getting some
      really nice stickers printed</li>
  <li>Fabrice Lorrain and the University of Marne la Vallée, for
      printing the two giant flyers</li>
  <li>The VideoLAN team, for lending us a long table and a couple of
      chairs</li>
  <li>Martin Michlmayr, for his support as the DPL</li>
</ul>

<p>Without the help of these people and sponsors, the Debian booth
wouldn't have been such a success. Thanks to you all.</p>


<h3>Special Thanks</h3>

<p>Loïc Bernable deserves some special thanks for coordinating the
..Org Pavillion this year again. It's a tough job, especially this
year, as he had to deal with ineffective organizers.</p>

<p>Alix Guillard and Anne were there to help him, thanks to them
too.</p>


<h3>Next year</h3>

<p>We'll be there next year too. See you !</p>
