<define-tag intro>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.debian.org.es/">Debian-Spain association</a>
will organize the second conference of Debian developers in Spain,
which will take place at Guadalajara. The conference's goal 
is to get together users of the Debian GNU/Linux distribution, 
developers members of the Debian project and of Debian derived
distributions and have them work together in the development of
programs which are part of the distribution, bug fixing, system
integration and translation of applications.
