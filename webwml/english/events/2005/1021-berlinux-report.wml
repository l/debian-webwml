<p>This year's Berlinux took place on the 21st and 22nd of
October. Debian was represented with a booth and several
non-Debian-specific talks by members of the Debian Project. I didn't
attend the first exhibition day, so I can only account of the social
event and the second day. The Social Event was quite nice, cheap
drinks, delicious food, lots of people ... everything that makes a
nice evening. There was a lot of "trans-project talk" and also a
planetpenguin-racer tournament had been planned, but that had to be
canceled due to technical problems.</p>

<p>The exhibition on Saturday started rather early (9:00 am). I took
place in the halls of the Technical University of Berlin, whichhas
rather broad corridors, so there was enough space to set up movable
walls and tables at both sides and still leave enough space for people
to walk by. The Debian booth's biggest attraction certainly was Frank
Ronneburg's Debian controlled model railway, apart from that we had a
Nokia 770 (Thanks Wolfgang, you are one brave man!) and the usual
stuff, lanyards, posters and several people's laptops for
demonstrations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there were some problems with the Berlinux
organisation so the planned Berlinux CDs weren't available and
attendance was also rather low, many of the people walking by were uni
students on their way to other events. The talks managed to attract a
higher number of people, as far as I know most speakers were quite
pleased by their attendance numbers. The made up for those of us who
aren't from Berlin but had to travel there, since only going there to
man the booth probably wouldn't have been worth the effort.</p>
