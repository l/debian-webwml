<p>This year's Berlinux exhibition and conference took place on the
21st and 22nd of October. Debian was represented with a booth and
several non-Debian-specific talks by members of the Debian Project. On
the first day most of the visitors seemed to be students from
University in which the event took place.</p>

<p>The Social Event was quite nice, cheap drinks, delicious food, lots
of people ... everything that makes a nice evening. There was a lot of
"trans-project talk".  A planetpenguin-racer tournament had also been
planned, but that had to be canceled due to technical problems.</p>

<p>The exhibition on Saturday started rather early (9:00 am). It took
place in the halls of the Technical University of Berlin, which has
rather broad corridors, so there was enough space to set up movable
walls and tables at both sides and still leave enough space for people
to walk by. The Debian booth's biggest attraction certainly was Frank
Ronneburg's Debian controlled model railway, apart from that we had a
Nokia 770 (Thanks Wolfgang, you are one brave man!) and the usual
stuff, lanyards, posters and several people's laptops for
demonstrations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there were some problems with the Berlinux
organisation so the planned Berlinux CDs weren't available and
attendance was also rather low, many of the people walking by were uni
students on their way to other events. The talks managed to attract a
higher number of people, as far as I know most speakers were quite
pleased by their attendance numbers. They made up for those of us who
aren't from Berlin but had to travel there, since only going there to
man the booth probably wouldn't have been worth the effort.</p>
