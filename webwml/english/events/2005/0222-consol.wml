<define-tag intro>
<p>
  CONSOL is one of Mexico's two Free Software conferences, and has been held
  since 2002. This conference aims at making the community better, not bigger,
  and has been community-driven since it was originally conceived. It has grown
  from a completely home brewn 200-people conference to over 700 attendees from
  all over Mexico, even with interested people from other Latin American
  countries, and guest speakers from all over the world.

<p>
  Debianmexico will be present with a booth in the exhibition area.  Several
  Debian developers will be present, to answer all kinds of questions, demonstrate
  different things or happily sign one's gpg-key.  Steve Langasek will deliver a
  talk about &quot;the QA crisis in Free Software&quot; and  David Moreno will
  deliver talks about &quot;Creating packages for Debian&quot; and &quot;How to
  help the Debian project&quot;.
