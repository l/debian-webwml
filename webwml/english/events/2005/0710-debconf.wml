<define-tag intro>

<p>Debconf is a conference with, by and for Debian Developers.
Non-developers are quite welcome to attend as well, but are not the
conference's primary audience.</p>

<p>A work camp will be organised in the week before the conference.
This is a chance for developers to work together face to face in
groups and teams.</p>

survival of dropped architectures.</p>
