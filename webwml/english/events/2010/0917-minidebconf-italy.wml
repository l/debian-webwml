<define-tag intro>

<p>
  This is the fifth Italian Debian Community Conference,
  the common forum where all Italian users, translators, and developers can
  share and discuss knowledge and ideas about Debian.
</p>

<p>
  This year's conference will be organized in collaboration with the
  local Italian Ubuntu team, with many shared talks and practical
  sessions. It will be focused on Debian/Ubuntu interaction, as the
  name itself suggests.
