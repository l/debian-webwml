<define-tag intro>

<p>
Debian France is organizing the first Paris Mini-DebConf. This event
will welcome everyone with an interest in the Debian project for a
series of talks and workshops about Debian. Allowing users, contributors
and developers to meet each other is also one of the main goals of this
event. We are especially looking forward to meeting Debian developers
from around the world :)
</p>

<p>
The Paris Mini-DebConf 2010 will be held at Universit&eacute; Paris Diderot -
Paris 7, Paris, France, on October 30 and 31.
