<define-tag intro>

<p>FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting) is a free
and non-commercial event for the community and organized by the community.
Its goal is to provide Free and Open Source developers and communities a
place to meet to:</p>

<ul>

<li>get in touch with other developers and projects,</li>

<li>get informed about the latest developments in the Free and Open Source world,</li>

<li>attend interesting talks and presentations held in large conference
rooms by Free and Open Source project leaders and committers on various
topics,</li>

<li>and to promote the development and the benefits of Free and Open Source
solutions.</li>

</ul>

</define-tag>

<define-tag involve>

<p>A booth will be requested.</p>

<p>Since 2010, Debian has not received a Developers' room (nor has any other
Linux distribution, for that matter); instead, a multi-distribution
<q>miniconference</q> will be held that we'll participate in.</p>
