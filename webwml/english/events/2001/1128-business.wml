<define-tag intro>

    The first conference "Free Software: Business Models and Corporate
    Initiatives" was held in Moscow.  It was held within the
    frameworks of the Electronic Russia federal special program.  This
    program was designed as means of shortening the "digital divide"
    between Russian transitional economy and Western economies.

    <p>The main goal of the event was stated as establishing a mutual
    understanding between all parties concerned and involved in
    establishing the social institute of Free Software in Russia,
    including developers, providers, and customers.  Two well-known
    companies, <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">IBM</a> and <a
    href="http://www.sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>, sponsored this
    event.
