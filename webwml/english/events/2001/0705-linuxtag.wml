<define-tag intro>

    <a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
    most important Linux exhibition and conference in Europe.  Last
    year's event has interested about 17,000 visitors with expected
    even more this year.  The motto is <em>Where .com meets
    .org</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
    professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
    quality gratis conference program.

<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
    middle of the regular exhibition space together with business
    booths.  After a long time this is another  opportunity
    to put names and email addresses to faces and personalities.

    <p>It is planned to organize a Debian Day that would contain
    interesting talks suited for Debian developers. Aside from these
    talks, there will be a <a href="http://www.infodrom.ffis.de/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/debian-joey.html">general talk</a> introducing into Debian
    GNU/Linux held by Martin `Joey' Schulze.
