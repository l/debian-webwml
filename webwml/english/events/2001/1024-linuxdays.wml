<define-tag intro>

    The aim of the Linuxdays is to promote and support the Open Source
    &amp; Free Software movement.  The basic idea of Open Source &amp;
    Free Software is that developers around the world distribute,
    modify and test their software via the internet, resulting in
    products often exceeding the quality of commercial software.  The
    power and cumulated knowledge of the Open Source &amp; Free
    Software Community ensures that new features are implemented very
    quickly and that bugs are fixed the moment they are discovered.
    In order to promote the Open Source &amp; Free Software Idea and
    to bring it to the Luxembourg public, a group of research
    scientist from the <a href="http://www.tudor.lu/">Centre de
    Recherche Public Henri Tudor</a> in collaboration with the <a
    href="http://www.linux.lu/">Linux User Group Luxembourg</a> is
    organizing the first Linuxdays in Luxembourg.  There will be two
    days of presentation and discussions, divided into one business
    track and one technical track.
