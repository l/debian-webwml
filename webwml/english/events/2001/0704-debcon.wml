<define-tag intro>

    <p><a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">LSM</a>, the Libre Software Meeting,
	is not another Linux event: it gathers <em>libre</em> (free)
	projects and developers and allows organizations distributed around
	the globe to have the maximum amount of members (or advanced users)
	once a year all in one place, at the same time. They can spend five
	days together to improve <em>libre</em> software via discussions,
	speeches or coding parties.
	The <em>LSM</em> is a place where free organizations or
	"enterprises" ordinarily living through Internet are made physical
	realities.

	<p>The public, private individuals, societies or public institutions
	is, of course, invited to discover libre software by meeting the
	attendees.

	<p>Like in 2000, the second edition of the Debian Conference - the
	<em>Debian Conference 1</em> - will be held during the LSM, taking
	benefit from the infrastructures of the meeting.
	<p>The event will start with the "Speech from the Throne", <em>Ian
	Murdock</em> and <em>Bruce Perens</em> being our guests of honour. 
	For the first time we will be able to present the human form of
	a maximum amount of Debian email addresses!
	<p>The Debian Conference is made for and by Debian: it is up to the
	Debianers to define the subjects, the priorities. And it is the role
	of the organizer to give the opportunities.
