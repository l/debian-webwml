<define-tag intro>

    <a href=http://lsm.abul.org/>LSM</a> (the Libre Software Meeting)
	is not another Linux event : its goal is, primarily, to gather <em>libre
	projects and developers</em>, to allow distributed organizations
	such as the free ones to have, one time each year, the maximum of
	their members or advanced users all in one place, at the same time
	with the same aim : to take the opportunity of these 5 days together
	to improve libre software via discussions, speeches or coding parties. 
	The <em>LSM</em> is a place where free organizations or
	"enterprises" ordinarily living through Internet are made physical
	realities.<br>
	The public, private individuals, societies or public institutions
	is, of course, invited to discover libre software by meeting the
	attendees.

	Like in 2000, the second edition of the Debian Conference - the
	<em>Debian Conference 1</em> - will be held during the LSM, taking
	benefit from the infrastructures of the meeting.<br>
	The event will start with the "Speech from the Throne", <em>Ian
	Murdock</em> and <em>Bruce Perens</em> being our guests of honour. 
	For the first time, a photograph of Debian will be realized! 
	For the first time we will be able to give an human reality to a 
	maximum of Debian email addresses!<br>
	The Debian Conference is made for and by Debian : it is up to the
	debianers to define the subjects, the priorities. And it is the role
	of the organizer to give the opportunities.
