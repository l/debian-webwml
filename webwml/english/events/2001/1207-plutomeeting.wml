<define-tag intro>

    <a href="http://meeting.pluto.linux.it/">Pluto Meeting</a> has 
    been for years the main Italian event on Free
    Software. Born as the yearly national assembly of Pluto FSUG 
    (hence the name), Pluto Meeting has become the place where all 
    the developers of Free code in Italy meet every year with their 
    peers and the industry members and companies having an interest 
    in Free and Open Software.

    <p>Within the event, talks will be given by major Italian and 
    international experts on both introductory and advanced topics relating 
    to Linux, to state of the art technologies and to Free Software and its
    ideals. The focus is on software distributed under Free or Open 
    Licenses.

<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be present with a booth.  It will be located somewhere
    in the main hall, together with business booths.  After a long time 
    this is another  opportunity to put names and email addresses to 
    faces and personalities.

    <p>Debian developers will be there with CDs of the Debian distribution
    and T-shirts; to meet other developers, exchange gpg fingerprints, chat
    about their loved distribution and (more seriously) talk about Debian to
    the public.
