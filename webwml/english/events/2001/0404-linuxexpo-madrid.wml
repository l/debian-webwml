<define-tag intro>

    <a href="http://www.linuxexpomadrid.com/">Linux Expo Madrid</a> is one of
    the biggest exhibitions in Madrid regarding Linux. Last year's
    event was attended by over 3,500 visitors. In this occasion
    more than 60 different companies related to Linux.
    Linux Expo Madrid will have a place for the community, a 
    professional exhibition and a conference program.

<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be present with a booth.  The location in the 
    exhibit is not known currently.  It will surely be a place
    where anyone can ask Debian developers since many of
    the spanish developers will attend, and you can have many
    good Debian chats there. So it's your opportunity to
    put names and faces to nicks and emails. If you want
    a Debian sticker for your laptop or monitor, be sure
    to visit the stand.

    <p>
    A BOF (Bird's of a Feather Meeting) will also 
    be held (schedule not yet available, check Linux Expo's
    web site). There, users and developers can meet and talk
    freely about Debian. Last year we had Wichert (Project
    Leader) and five spanish developers: Enrique Zanardi,
    Enrique Díaz Comellas, Juan Cespedes, Roberto Lumbreras, and Javier Fernández-Sanguino.
    The room was crowded but it was a lot of fun.
