<p>At <a href="0705-linuxtag">LinuxTag 2001</a> about thirty Debian developers and as many
users met at the Debian booth and participated in the first <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/day.php3">Debian Day</a>.  This
was a one-day conference organized by Debian developers who gave talks about various issues for
other developers and users.  The Debian Day was a great success and shall be repeated next
year.  At the end of the schedule we've had a keysigning session organized in order to improve
everybody's web of trust.

<p>At our <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/booth.html">booth</a> 
we were able to demonstrate Debian running on half a dozen architectures.  We have had the
opportunity to use a loaned Alpha DS20 from <a href="http://www.compaq.com/">Compaq</a> and a
multiprocessor UltraSparc 80 loaned by <a href="http://www.sun.com/">Sun</a>.  The Dreamcast
box connected to a regular tv monitor, displaying X11, also attracted a lot of people at the booth.

<p>Although the Debian booth was even larger than last years booth, it was still overcrowded
most of the time.  Through sponsors we have had the opportunity to produce <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/LinuxTag2001/cd.html">special Debian
CD-ROMs</a> to give away to visitors who wanted to try out Debian GNU/Linux.  In addition to
that the LinuxTag-Crew has produced a <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">conference
CD</a> with a Linux system which is running directly from CD-ROM without any installation
to the hard disk, based on Debian GNU/Linux.  About 17,000 people visited this year's
LinuxTag, some 6,000 ended up with a Debian CD in their bag.

<p>During the Debian Day Richard Higson gave a <a
href="http://pax.gt.owl.de/~higson/LinuxTag2001/Deb390-talk.html">talk</a> about Debian
GNU/Linux on <a href="$(HOME)/ports/s390/">IBM S/390 machines</a>.  The
porting on S/390 is going on well, a lot of packages (some 3000) have been compiled for this
architecture, a brute force build daemon is running on a Multiprise 3000 hosted at <a
href="http://www.millenux.com/company.html">Millenux</a>.  This suddenly lead into a notice of
intention by some developers, some people working for IBM and the Stuttgart based company <a
href="http://www.trustsec.de/">trustsec IT solutions GmbH</a>, who plan to work on getting
Debian GNU/Linux officially supported by IBM on the S/390 architecture, alongside with other
distributions.
