<define-tag intro>

    Multimediamarket is an exhibition basically covering Multimedia
    and eCommerce.  Since last year they provide a bonus to their
    visitors, a Linux area hosting a couple of company booths and
    project booths.  It is rounded up by a "Forum" in which talks will
    be held covering Linux and Free Software.

<define-tag involve>

    The Debian Project has received an offer to run a booth in the
    Linux area among others like PHP, GIMP and VRML.  It is quite
    likely that there will also be a talk covering the Debian project.
