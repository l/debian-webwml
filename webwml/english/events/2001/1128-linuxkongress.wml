<define-tag intro>

    <p><a href="http://www.linux-kongress.org/">International Linux
    Kongress</a> is Europe's one and only developer congress targetting the
    the Linux community.  Famous topics have always been kernel and driver
    development as well as interfaces to professional software.  This
    year's congress takes place at the University of Twente in The
    Netherlands.</p>

<define-tag involve>

    <p>The Debian project has been offered to hold a workshop and run a
    booth during the congress.  The workshop takes place on Wednesday
    from 12 o'clock until 18 o'clock and will contain both technical
    and political issues of the Debian Project.  However, the content
    of it will mainly be controlled by what the audience would like to
    know.  The workshop will be run by Martin "Joey" Schulze and other
    Debian developers.  Thomas Lange will also give a talk about the
    Fully Automated Installation (FAI) which will take place at
    Thursday 11:30-12:15.</p>

    <p>We will probably go out for dinner on Wednesday and attend the
    social event of Linux Kongress on Thursday evening.  Feel free to
    meet us there.</p>
