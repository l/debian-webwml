#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Conference 1 -- Report"

<p>The first <a href="0704-debcon">official Debian conference</a> was held last week during
the <a href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting</a> (LSM) in Bordeaux, France.
Although Debian founder Ian Murdock and ex-DPL Bruce Perens canceled their travel a week
before the conference started, the event has been a great success.  40 to 50 developers
and about 20 Debian users came to the famous city of wine in order to discuss various
issues and to socialize.  <a
href="http://lsm.abul.org/program/topic20/topic20.php3">Talks</a> during the day
stimulated many discussions which were continued during the evening either while going to
the city for food or while hacking in the university computer rooms.

<p>For those who have not been able to come to Debian Conference 1, an impression of the
event can be won by looking at the large collection of photos taken by <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~rb/lsm/">Roland Bauerschmidt</a> and <a
href="http://www.james.rcpt.to/2001/conf-1.deb/">James Bromberger</a>.  Furthermore, the
organizer Thierry Laronde had the great idea to take a photo of all developers who came to
the event -- <a
href="http://www.ucc.gu.uwa.edu.au/~james/2001/conf-1.deb/5th-day/preview-114-1435_IMG.JPG.html">the
photo</a> shows the great variety of Debian.  For those who want to read more about the
conference and see slides of the talks, Arto Teräs has written an extended <a
href="http://www.niksula.cs.hut.fi/~ateras/travel/debian_conference/">travel report</a>
with many links to other sites.

<p>Although the conference is over, the discussions continue via the Internet and one of the
hot topics is currently where Debian Conference 2 is going to be held.
