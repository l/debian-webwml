<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be presented on some architectures at a booth and a
    speech by Thomas Bliesener will give an introduction to the Debian
    project.  Here's the abstract:

    <blockquote>
    
    <p>In the past years a quiet revolution occured in the world of software,
    which attracts the attention now also in Mexico.
    
    <p>The speech gives an introduction to the free software movement, its
    history and philosophy.  It describes, what characterizes Free
    Software, by which licenses it is protected and how you can get Free
    Software.
    
    <p>In the second part of the speech the fascinating international Debian
    project is presented, which arranges the free distribution of same
    name.  In the end there will be time for questions and a discussion
    over the future of Free Software and how the country can profit from
    it.
