<define-tag intro>

    The forum itself will probably be of interest for the attending
    developers and Debian users.  The link above displays information
    only in portuguese, sorry.

<define-tag involve>

    The first meeting of South-American Debian developers will be held
    as part of the Second International Forum on Free Software.  The
    designated meeting place is the Hotdog stand outside the main
    conference hall during most of the forum. We have a conference
    room reserved for the Debian meeting for May 30th, 14:00h -
    16:00h.  Five developers from Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay have
    already confirmed their presence.
