<define-tag intro>
  This is a roadshow that wanders through several
  locations of Austria.  There will be different presentations,
  workshops and discussions with topics on Free Software and related
  subjects.  LinuxWochen will last longer than just from 5th to 7th
  in general, but at that time it will be in Vienna.

<define-tag involve>
    The Debian project will be represented in Vienna with a booth run
    by Gerfried Fuchs. He is also planning to give a talk about
    the first steps after Debian has been installed (how to tweak it to your
    likes).
