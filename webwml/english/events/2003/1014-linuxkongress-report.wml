<p>The Debian booth was mainly organized by members of the university's Unix
user group (thanks Arne!). The congress organizers were so kind to
provide free access to the conference for all Debian staff members (thanks go to Uli Weis
and Martin Schulte). Joey sent us posters, we very much liked the A0
version of <a href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/mike.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>We started setting up the booth on Tuesday, when the congress
tutorials took place. The Max Planck Institute provided us with two
Dual-Pentiums and one very strange x86 box from SGI. Debian was
quickly installed on the former two, but the SGI refused to boot from
anything that did not look like an SGI install CD.  We've got network
access through WLAN on a laptop running sid.  The Debian booth also
provided net access to the neighboring NetBSD booth. As most visitors
were busy with the tutorials, there wasn't much activity around our
booth.</p>

<p>The main congress programme started on Wednesday.  Thomas Lange and
Constantin Hellweg demonstrated the FAI installer on two
machines. Many people came around and asked us about FAI and Debian in
general. We didn't have CDROMs to hand out, but burned some woody
images on request.</p>

<p>The evening began with a key signing party which, unfortunately,
ended quite early, so people coming 5min late had to ask for signatures
themselves. The following social event took place in a café on the
campus, and was much fun to be there. The catering was excellent. Some
people later joined a table football session in a student's residence
nearby, which went far into the night.</p>

<p>The closing day, Thursday, went along with further FAI demonstrations
and people visiting the booth.</p>

<p>Overall, I must say that it was definitely worth the effort of
running the Debian booth at the Linux Kongress, as Debian was
mentioned by several speakers during their talks and people could come
by to get in touch with Debian people.</p>
