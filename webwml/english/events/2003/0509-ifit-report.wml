<h3>Panel Discussion</h3>

<p>This Informationday Free Information Technology (IFIT) is the first
such conference that was organised by the department of science and
responsibility (WuV) of the University of Innsbruck.  Many people have
helped create this conference by working on small bits, just as if it
was Free Software.  Even though IFIT was meant as a one day conference
a panel discussion took place on Friday evening already.</p>

<p>A panel discussion normally is interesting to watch since normally
there are experts who discuss issues.  However, this time, there were
three politicians (a fourth canceled his attendance).  The discussion
started with an introduction into Open Source and was more like a quiz
"find the first hundred bugs".  This was really hard to stand.  She
mixed up everything she could.</p>

<p>It was a good idea, though, to include the audience into the
discussion and give them a chance to ask questions to the panel
members.  Only the ambassador of one party (The Greens) seemed to
understand the issues and gave clear statements pro Open Source and
contra software patents.  The others mixed that up and even admired
patents.</p>

<p>A small buffet provided space for additional discussions between
speakers, visitors and officials.  After the university was closed
discussions were continued in a hotel nearby almost until dawn.  Even
though, this is quite common for conferences covering Free Software,
it seemed to be totally uncommon to the conference officials.</p>

<h3>Informationday Free Information Technology</h3>

<p>The conference consists of talks and workshops as well as a small
information lounge in which the Debian project, the Verein zur
Förderung Freier Software (FFS) of Austria and the Linux User Group Tirol were able to
maintain a booth, next to several commercial booths.  During the talks
all booths were almost empty and only staff were around.</p>

<p>In workshops speakers informed the audience about the use of Free
Software in education as well as in governmental agencies and
businesses.  It was emphasised several times that some goals and
products couldn't be reached with proprietary and license-aware
software.  Free Software opened up new possibilities and chances.</p>

<p>The Debian talk revealed how development is done in the Debian
project.  The speaker explained the benefits of the open development
model, the used mechanisms and the framework that helps the project
not end up in total chaos.  He outlined the way developers work
together collaboratively and how important changes are discussed and
implemented.</p>

<p>At the end of the day the final talk covered the future of free
information technology and focused on threats that could harm Free
Software and technology.  This includes non-free standards and
hardware but the main threat lays in the legal acceptance of software
patents and granting trivial patents like progress bars or storing of
audio data.</p>

<p>After the talk a small buffet was prepared, so discussions
continued until the university was closed again.  A Greek café hosted
the discussion afterwards, but not as long as yesterday.</p>

<p>Most talks and workshops were recorded digitally.  Video <a

streams</a> are provided by the IFIT organisation crew.  A best-of DVD
is also in production, details about this will be announced on the <a
