<h3>Thursday, 17th of July: Arrival</h3>

<p>At <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>, the week before
DebConf, J&ouml;rg Wendland and I discovered, that we both
booked the same RyanAir flight. Both of us had other appointments in
this week, so we couldn't take the &quot;Debian-Flight&quot; to DebCamp right after
LinuxTag.</p>

<p>Since J&ouml;rg lives in Ulm and I live in Frankfurt, which is about on the way to
Frankfurt-Hahn, the Airport used by RyanAir (which isn't really near to
Frankfurt at all), we decided to travel together. Since we needed to be
there very early, he decided to drive to Frankfurt the evening before. Some
traffic jams later, a few hours sleep and no breakfast we were on our way to
Frankfurt-Hahn.</p>

<p>Finding the way to so called Frankfurt-Hahn wasn't a problem at all, while finding
a parking place was one. We almost spent more time searching for a parking
place and getting back to the terminal than actually flying to Norway.</p>

<p>But we got there in time (we even had time for coffee and croissants),
and although we brought much of those not very well selling &quot;Morons!
I'm surrounded by morons!&quot; T-Shirts, we luckily missed the weight
limit but one kilogram.</p>

<p>All in all we had quite luck with our flight. J&ouml;rg got a window seat, so
could take some photos, and on my other side sat just a little girl, so I
had comfortable space for my legs. We arrived 25 minutes earlier than
expected - nearly one quarter of the planned time.</p>

<p>After the landing we took another coffee, looking amused at all those
tourists, who tried to get into one small bus. Since we arrived earlier
than planned, the place in this bus barely fitted. Again we had luck,
since we took the bus half an hour later (which was the bus we
ought to take anyway), it was quite empty, and we had much space for our legs.</p>

<p>The trip with the bus took nearly two hours - Oslo-Torp is as Oslo as
Frankfurt-Hahn is Frankfurt. But that didn't surprise or annoyed us. J&ouml;rg took the
opportunity to sleep a little bit, while I took a look at this foreign country
(of which J&ouml;rg told me every time he woke up, it isn't very foreign,
because it looks like <a href="http://www.all-on.de/">Allg&auml;u</a>).</p>

<p>When we arrived at Oslo's bus-terminal, we were picked up by J&ouml;rgs
sister and her friend, who were traveling through Scandinavia for two
months already. They explained me the way to my <a
href="http://www.perminalen.com/">hotel</a>, and took J&ouml;rg with them to their camping
place. We were going to meet later that day, for the BBQ of the <a
href="http://www.nuug.no/">NUUG</a>.</p>

<p>Finding the hotel was easy, and I kept wondering, how polite and helpful
people are in Norway.  I booked a bed in a four bedded room, but the other three
beds were empty. Funny thing: I thought about booking a single room.
So I stayed in this four bed room, which is even divided into
four parts bigger than my apartment at home.</p>

<p>As easy as finding the hotel was as difficult it was to find the
university. On my hotels web page a map showed, that Oslo's university was
quite near. Perhaps 15 Minutes per feet. What I didn't know was, that
this was only the Old university building, while the Department of
Informatics resides at the new university campus. But I was in good
company, since the first five people I asked didn't know that as
well.</p>

<p>However, finally I found someone, who explained me the way using the local
subway, so eventually arrived at Blindern-Station, and found some nice signs with
arrows and swirls. Sadly I misinterpreted some of them (an arrow pointing
down the page doesn't mean you have to go back), but at the end I
came to the university's Department of Informatics (I always thought
informaticians call themself &quot;computer scientists&quot; in
English).</p>

<p>J&ouml;rg hasn't arrived yet, but I met some of the guys I already knew, and
instantly rued to missed DebCamp as I saw the gathered manpower working
on Debian.</p>

<p>When Martin 'tbm' Michlmayr saw me, he asked me if I would
write for magazines or knew someone who does. He was looking for someone who would
write a small article about Debian's tenth birthday in August for the German
<a href="http://www.heise.de/">Heise</a> Verlag (publishing the major
IT-magazines c't and ix). I had written small
articles for my university's paper, but this was a much bigger thing. So I
told him, that I wouldn't do it, but I read (technical) articles by Martin
'Joey' Schulze and Michael Meskes.  Since I left my notebook
at the hotel and since I had
nothing to do, I tried to create an article prototype, which could be
patched by the others, or completely rewritten.</p>

<p>Soon the BBQ organized by the Norwegian Unix User Group was started
among others I met J&ouml;rg, his sister and her friend again.
For example that Swedish guy, who couldn't pronounce my name, which
didn't matter, since I could not pronounce his name either.  The
barbecue was excellent, although it started to rain later that
evening.</p>

<p>Since I was quite tired I left the party early and Andreas Tille took me a
good part of my way back to the hotel with his rented car.</p>

<p>When I arrived back at my hotel I had a small talk with the doorman in
English since he thought I was an Englishman, until we ironed this out,
and continued in German, since no one of us had a faultless
English, but his German was better than my Norwegian ;-)</p>

<h3>Friday, 18th of July: First day</h3>

<p>When I arrived at DebConf (this time I found it in the first attempt) - this
time with notebook - I finished the birthday article and sent it to Joey and tbm
for corrections, and started the usual work - reading mails, chatting,
reading and translating documentation and starting to create my first
Debian package.</p>

<p>At 3pm Tollef 'Mithrandir' Fog Heen opened the conference
and gave a small introduction, while tbm and some other guys told us
some more,
followed by a &quot;getting to know each other&quot;, which meant for
most guys &quot;back to the notebook&quot;.</p>

<p>At 6pm I had to decide between an SPI workshop by Benjamin 'Mako' Hill and a
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">Fully Automatic
Installation</a> (FAI) workshop by Holger Levsen. I decided on the FAI
workshop, since I thought it might be useful for my work at my university
(where most computers work under Red Hat... well, I should say &quot;run Red Hat&quot;,
it doesn't work very well).  Too bad,
the room was too small, too hot and not everything worked as expected. However, I
heard, that the SPI workshop was very funny.</p>

<p>At 8pm a keysigning party took place. Since we were more than a hundred people
Peter 'weasel' Palfrader decided to use a camera and a projector to show the
ID of one person to every other one the same time. Many people (especially
those in the rear row) weren't satisfied by this, me being among them. Hence, the day
after this, many people showed their ID again to other people in order
to get them sign their keys.  We should have left the building at 9pm,
but didn't make it.</p>

<p>Some might call it paranoia, but hey: it is the Web of trust. It is not only
for my own sake, but for other people's as well, who trust me to sign keys correct. Hence,
I decided to sign only those with the statement &quot;done very careful
checking&quot;, whose ID I had in my hands, while signing
those, who I didn't saw last week at LinuxTag and only saw their ID via the
cam only at &quot;done casual checking&quot;.</p>

<h3>Saturday, 19th of July: Second day, woody's birthday</h3>

<p>This day is woody's first birthday.</p>

<p>I arrived a little bit too late for the first talk at that day: Legal aspects
of Free Software by Jonas &ouml;berg (I believe he came from the FSF
Europe). Hence, I could only attend the final discussion, which was quite
interesting, though.  I also missed the next talk, CDBS - Common
Debian build system by Jeff Bailey, 
since I had to finish some important mails and private stuff.</p>

<p>Next came a talk by Andreas Schuldei entitled &quot;Why tetrinet is good for
Debian&quot;. I arrived late, so I still don't know, what tetrinet is, but he talked about
the social structure of Debian, and what is so special about it. Quite
interesting and also funny presented.</p>

<p>We had lunch, several hundred mails and ran out of coke. After
lunch Martin 'tbm'
Michlmayr told us something about the tracking of inactive maintainers.
Interesting, but a little bit boring, since this covers project
internal, in which
I'm not (yet) very interested in (I'm not (yet) a
maintainer, but mainly a user and translator).</p>

<p>More interesting (and funnier as well) were the talks about FTP master's work (with
nice background images on the slides) and &quot;Security in Debian&quot;
by Javier Fernández-Sanguino 'JFS' Peña. He
started with some slides, but soon a discussion started, which made this
talk really interesting. Unfortunately we didn't had the time to draw
bigger conclusions about that, since it took to long.</p>

<p>At 7pm the &quot;formal&quot; dinner took place. Of course, a formal dinner organized by and
for geeks isn't very formal. It was thankfully sponsored by HP, so not only Tollef and
tbm gave small talks, but also Bdale. While tbm accentuated the importance of
the DebCamp, that it should be organized again, and of course thanked all
those people who where involved in planing this conference, Bdale (of
course) told us, how and why HP is going to help Debian.</p>

<p>The food was quite good and the drinks were for free (according to the
Norwegian price for a bear, this might mean, that HP invested much more
money in drinks, than in food) and so people stayed quite long
there.  When we needed to leave the university, some of us went out for another beer, and
later I finally went to my hotel.</p>

<h3>Sunday, 20th of July: The 'I don't want to leave' day</h3>

<p>Of course, I overslept - the beer was for free! In Norway! But even if I
would have woken up in time, I would have missed the first talk, since Oslo's
public transport system experienced some problems this morning. I
guess, it's something with the power. So they
canceled many subway and trams, and hence I arrived very late.</p>

<p>When I finally came there, I heard the news, that they needed to change
the schedule. Too bad, because so I missed nearly all of Enrico Zini's talk about Usability in
Debian, which I really wanted to hear.  However, I could attend JFS'
talk about i18n / l10n in Debian, which was of course an
important topic for a translator like me.</p>

<p>After that, Petter Reinholdtsen talked about and showed how to use the new
debian-installer in <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Skolelinux</a>.
Quite interesting and impressive: He answered two questions, and got an
running Skolelinux System (which is nearly Debian).</p>

<p>We took lunch (something with sausages and rice), and then Andreas Tille
talked about customized Debian distributions (formerly known as internal
sub-projects). Those customized Debian distributions are special tasks,
configurations and other stuff for a particular user group. You may already have
heard of <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Jr</a> or
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian Med</a>.</p>

<p>Last not least Branden Robinson talked about subversion, and how he is using
this CVS-replacing software to manage his packages. This was quite
interesting as well. I could consider
using this for my translations. However, I'm not sure, if it is worth the
effort, since only two of my reviewers know how to create a proper
patch-file.  I fear, that I will have to do all the work with this.</p>

<p>Finally DebConf was over. Many people left soon after the last talk, but some still stayed
and used the Internet connection for a couple of hours. The rest of
us went to the gym,
taking a coffee at a cafe nearby.  Finally some guys (including me) went
&quot;fjording&quot;. That is, if  some geeks travel nearly one hour with public
transport (in Oslo this includes ferries), to get to a small beach on an
island, get a little bit wet in the water, and finally cut their feet on the
shells, when trying to get back on dry land.  However, it was funny,
and we saw a beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>I went back to the gym with the others, with a detour to my hotel,
which is near the harbor were the ferry stops, in order to pick up my
backpack.  It was filled with &quot;Moron&quot; T-Shirts that Andreas
Tille should 
carry back to Germany, both J&ouml;rg and me were flying, while
Andreas rented a car.</p>

<p>When I left the gym to go back to my hotel, looking back and seeing those
geeks from all over the world unified working, I came to the conclusion,
that if I travel to the next DebConf, I will stay with the others in the
gym (or any other common accommodation) and attend DebCamp as well.</p>

<h3>Monday, 21st of July: Tourist day</h3>

<p>I stayed in Oslo for another day, looking around a bit and playing tourist
(don't know why all the others traveled back as soon as possible). It was
a good idea, since Oslo is a very nice city (especially if you come from
Frankfurt which mainly consist of glass, concrete and the
Goethe-Museum).</p>

<p>Funny thing about that: I stayed in the university for four days, while
the sun was shining and the temperature was only increasing. On
my tourist-day I had to learn that weather can change very fast in Norway.
I got soaked to the skin.</p>

<p>However, most of the day the sun was shining. I visited the Nobel institute
(it is surprisingly unbusted for someone who invented dynamite), the
sculpture park and much more.  I should have stayed longer, I didn't
see everything I was interested in.</p>

<p>The last evening I spent looking for a fish restaurant with a nice view.
Well, I thought that would be easy. I don't know why, but you can find
McDonald's, Burger King, 7-Eleven and restaurants selling
pizza and pasta everywhere in Oslo. However, it took me quite a while
to find a restaurant I was looking for, and when I found
one, it had a seaside view, but to the wrong direction. Hence, I couldn't see
the sunset. So I left the restaurant, and went to the other side of the
bay, back to askerus castle. Where I saw a very beautiful sunset.</p>
