<h3>ARRIVAL</h3> <h4>(Tuesday, 17th of July)</h4>


<p>At <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org">LinuxTag</a>, the week before
DebConf, J&ouml;rg Wendland a I discovered, that we
booked the same RyanAir flight. Both of us had other dates in
this week, so we couldn't take the &quot;Debian-Flight&quot; to DebCamp right after
LinuxTag.</p>

<p>Since J&ouml;rg lives in Ulm and I in Frankfurt, which is nearly on the way to
Frankfurt-Hahn, the Airport used by RyanAir (which isn't really near to
Frankfurt at all), we decided to travel together. And since we needed to be
there very early, he decided to drive to Frankfurt the evening before. Some
traffic jams later, a few hours sleep and no breakfast we were on our way to
Frankfurt-Hahn.</p>

<p>Finding the way to so called Frankfurt-Hahn wasn't a problem, while finding
a parking place was one. We almost spend more time searching for a parking
place and getting back to the terminal than flying to Norway.</p>

<p>But we got there in time (we even had time for coffee and croissants),
and although we brought much of those not very well selling &quot;MORONS
I'm surrounded by morons!&quot; T-Shirts, we luckily missed the weight
limit but one kilogram.</p>

<p>All in all we had quite luck with our flight. J&ouml;rg got a window seat, so
could take some photos, and on my other side sat just a little girl, so I
had comfortable space for my legs. And we arrived 25 minutes earlier than
planed - nearly one quarter of the planned time.</p>


<p>After the landing we took another coffee, looking amused at all those
tourists, which tried to get into one small bus. Since we arrived earlier
than planed, it barely fitted. Again we had luck: When we took the bus half
an hour later (since we arrived earlier than planed was this the bus we
ought to take), it was quite empty, and we had much space for our legs
;)</p>

<p>The trip with the bus took nearly two hours - Oslo-Torp is as Oslo as
Frankfurt-Hahn is Frankfurt. But that didn't cared us. J&ouml;rg took the
opportunity to sleep a little, while I took a look at this foreign country
(of which J&ouml;rg told me every time he woke up, it isn't very foreign,
because it looks like <a href="http://www.all-on.de/">Allg&auml;u).</p>

<p>When we arrived at Oslo's bus-terminal, we were picked up by J&ouml;rgs
sister and her friend, which were travelling through Scandinavia since two
month. They explained me the way to my <a
href="http://www.perminalen.com/">hotel</a>, and took J&ouml;rg with them to their camping
place. We were going to meet later that day, for the BBQ of the <a
href="http://www.nuug.no/">NUUG</a>.</p>

<p>Finding the Hotel was easy, and I kept on wondering, how polite and helpful
people are in Norway.  I booked a bed in a four bedded room, but the other three
beds were empty. Funny thing: I thought about booking a single room, but
didn't dis so. And so I were in this four bed room, which is even divided into
four parts bigger than my apartment at home :-)</p>

<p>As easy as finding the hotel was as difficult it was to find the
university. On my hotels webpage a map showed, that Oslo's university was
quite near. Perhaps 15 Minutes per feet. What I didn't know was, that
this was only the Old university building, while the Department of
Informatics resides at the new university campus. But I was in good
company, since the first five people I asked didn't know that as
well.</p>

<p>But finally I found someone, who explained me the way using the local
subway, and so arrived at Blindern-Station, and found some nice signs with
arrows and swirls. Sadly I misinterpreted some of them (an arrow pointing
down the page doesn't mean you have to go back), but in the end I
came to the universities Department of Informatics (I always thought
informaticians call them self &quot;computer scientist&quot; in
english?).</p>

<p>J&ouml;rg didn't arrived yet, but I greeted some of the guys I know, and
instantly rued to missed DepCamp, when I saw the gathered manpower working
on Debian.</p>

<p>When Martin &quot;tbm&quot; Michlmayr saw me, he asked me if I would
write for magazines or knew someone who does. He was looking for someone who would
write a small article about Debians tenth birthday in august for the german
<a href="http://www.heise.de/">Heise</a> Verlag (publishing the major
IT-magazines c't and ix). I had written small
articles for my universities paper, but this was a much bigger thing. So I
told him, that I wouldn't do it, but I read (technical) articles by Martin
&quot;Joey&quot; Schultze and Michael Meskes.</p>

<p>But since I left my notebook in the hotel (don't ask me why), and had
nothing to do, I tried to create an article prototype, which might be
patched by the others, or completely rewritten.</p>

<p>And soon the BBQ organized by the Norwegian Unix User Group was started and
I meet J&ouml;rg, his sister and her friend again. Of course I met much other
people, too. For example that swedish (?) guy, who could speak my name, which
didn't matter, since I could not speak his name either. I didn't got his
&quot;Chi&quot;-Loud (written Kje) correct ;)</p>

<p>Nevertheless we had a nice conversation, not only about Linux, but about
different styles of student representation and much more.</p>

<p>We had an excellent BBQ, although it started to rain later that
evening.</p>

<p>Since I was quite tired I left the party early and Andreas Tille took me a
good part of my way back to the hotel with his rented car.</p>

<p>When I arrived back at my hotel I had a small talk with the doorman in
english - he thought I was an Englishman - until we ironed out,
and carried on in german, since no one of us had an faultless
english, but his german was better than my norsk ;-)</p>


<h3>FIRST DAY</h3> <h4>(Friday, 18th of July)</h4>

<p>I stood up early, took breakfast at my hotel and went away to get more local
money and some other oddments.</p>

<p>When I arrived at DebConf (this time I found it in the first attempt) - this
time with notebook - I finished the birthday article and send it to Joey and tbm
for corrections, and started the usual work - reading Emails, chatting,
reading and translating documentation and starting to create my first
Debian package.</p>

<p>At 3pm Tollef &quot;Mithrandir&quot; Fog Heen gave a small
introduction, and tbm and some other guys told us a little bit, too,
followed by an &quot;getting to know each other&quot;, which meant for
most guys &quot;back to my notebook&quot;.</p>

<p>At 6pm I had to decide between an SPI Workship by Benjamin Mako Hill and an
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI (Fully Automatic
Installation)</a> Workshop by Holger Levsen. I took the FAI
workshop, since I thought it might be useful for my work at my university
(where most computers work under RedHat... well, I should say &quot;run RedHat&quot;,
it doesn't work very well).</p>

<p>Sadly the room was to small, to hot and not everything worked correct. But I
heard, that the SPI Workshop was very funny.</p>

<p>At 8pm a keysigning party took place. Since we were over a hundred people
Peter &quot;Weasel&quot; Palfrader decided to use a camera and a projector to show the
ID of one person to every other one the same time. Much people (especially
those in the rear row) weren't satisfied by this, and me too. So the day
after that, many people showed their ID again, direct to other
persons.</p>

<p>Some might call it paranoia, but hey: It is the Web of trust. It is not only
for my own sake, but for other people, who trust me to sign keys correct. So
I decided to sign only those with the statement &quot;done very careful
checking&quot;, whose ID I had in my hands, while signing
those, who I didn't saw last week at LinuxTag and only saw their ID via the
cam only at &quot;done casual checking&quot;.</p>

<p>Particularly because we had time pressure when we came to the last keys, and
were in hurry. We should have left the building at 9pm, but didn't got
it.</p>


<h3>MY BROTHERS BIRTHDAY</h3> <h4>(Saturday, 19th of July)</h4>

<p>The first thing I did, was sending my brother a SMS. Which didn't arrived
since I forget the international prefix number. Somebody in Norway might got
a little bit confused...</p>

<p>BTW: This was Woody's birthday, too.</p>

<p>I arrived a little bit to late in the first talk in that day: Legal aspects
of free software by Jonas &ouml;berg (I think he came from the FSF
Europe). So I only got the final discussion, which was quite
interesting.</p>

<p>I missed the next talk, CDBS - Common Debian build system by Jeff Bailey,
too, since I had some important mails to send and some private stuff to
do.</p>

<p>Next came a talk by Andreas Schuldei titled &quot;Why tetrinet is good for
Debian&quot;. I came late, so I don't know, what tetrinet is, but he talked about
the social structure of Debian, and what is the special about it. Quite
interesting and funny presented.</p>

<p>We had lunch, several hundred emails and run out of coke. Then Martin &quot;tbm&quot;
Michlmayr told us something about the tracking of inactive maintainers.
Interesting, but a little bit boring, since that are project interns, of which
I'm not very interested in (I might have told you, that I'm no
maintainer, but mainly a user and translator).</p>

<p>More interesting (and funnier) were the talks about FTP Master work (with
nice background images on the foils) and &quot;Security in Debian&quot;
by Javier Fernández-Sanguino &quot;JFS&quot; Peña. JFS
started with some foils, but soon a discussion started, which made this
talk really interesting. Unfortunately we didn't had the time to draw
bigger conclusions about that, since it took to long.</p>

<p>At 7pm the &quot;formal&quot; diner started. Of course a formal diner organized by and
for geeks isn't very formal. It was sponsored by HP, so not only Tollef and
tbm had a small talks, but bdale, too. While tbm accentuated the importance of
the DebCamp, that it should be organized again, and of course thanked all
those people who where involved in planing this conference, Bdale (of
course) told us, how and why HP is going to help debian.</p>

<p>The food was quite good, and the drinks were for free (according to the
norwegian price for a bear, this might mean, that HP invested much more
money in drinks, than in food ;) and so people stayed quite long
there.</p>

<p>When we needed to leave the university, some went for another beer, and
later I finally went to my hotel.<p>


<p>BTW: Of course I send my brother a nice birthday card, too. But I
arrived earlier ;)</p>


<h3>I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE DAY</h3> <h4>(Sunday, 20th of July)</h4>

<p>Of course I overslept - the beer was for free! In Norway! But even if I
would have woken up in time, I would have missed the first talk, since Oslo's
public transport system had some problems, I think with the power. So they
canceled many subway and trams, and I arrived very late.</p>

<p>But when I finally came there, I heard the news, that they needed to change
the schedule. I missed nearly all of Enrici Zinis talk about Usability in
Debian, which I really wanted to hear.</p>

<p>But I got JFS talk about i18n / l10n in Debian, which was of course an
important topic for a translator like me.</p>

<p>After that, Peter Reinholdtsen talked about and showed how to use the new
debian-installer in <a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/">Skolelinux</a>.
Quite interesting and impressive: He answered two questions, and got an
running Skolelinux System (which is nearly Debian).</p>

<p>We took lunch (something with sausages and rice), and then Andreas Tille
talked about customized debian distributions (formerly known as internal
subprojects). Those customized debian distributions are special tasks,
configurations and other stuff for a particular user group, you might have
heard of <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-jr/">DebianJr</a> or
<a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-med/">DebianMed</a>.</p>

<p>Last not least Branden Robinson talked about subversion, and how he is using
this CVS-kind software to manage his packages. Interesting, too. I consider
of using this for my translations. But I'm not sure, if it is worth the
afford, since only two of my reviewer know hot to create a proper
patch-file, I fear, that I will have to do all the work with this.</p>

<p>And finally DebConf was over. Much people left soon, but some still stayed
and used the internet connection for a couple of hours. All the rest of
us went to the gym,
taking a coffee at a nearby cafe, and finally some guys (including me) went
&quot;fjording&quot;. That is, if  some geeks travel nearly one hour with public
transport (which includes in Oslo fairies), to get to a small beach on an
island, get a little bit wet in the water, and finally cut their feet on the
shells, when trying to get back on dry land.</p>

<p>But it was funny, and we saw a beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>I went back to the gym with the other - a detour, my hotel is near to the
harbor were the fairy stops - to pick up my backpack (which was filled
with &quot;Moron&quot; T-Shirts, we sold much, I gave the rest to Andreas Tille, to
carry them back to Germany - since both J&ouml;rg Wendland and me were flying
back, while Andreas rented a car) and my notebook.</p>

<p>When I left the gym to go back to my hotel, looking back and seeing those
geeks from all over the world unified working, I came to the conclusion,
that if I travel to the next DebConf, I will stay with the others in the
gym (or any other common accommodation) and attend DebCamp as well.</p>


<h3>FINAL</h3>

<p>I stayed in Oslo for an other day, looking a bit around and playing tourist
(don't know why all the others traveled back as soon as possible). It was
a good idea, since Oslo is a very nice city (especially if you come from
Frankfurt which mainly consist of glass, concrete and the
Goethe-Museum).</p>

<p>Funny thing about that: I stayed four days in the university, while
the sun was shining and the temperature was increasing and increasing. And
on my tourist-day I learned that weather can change very fast in Norway.
I got soaked to the skin.<p>

<p>But most of the day was sunny. I visited the Nobel institute
(it is surprisingly unbusted for someone who invented dynamite), the
sculpture park and much more, but I should have stayed longer, I didn't
saw everything I was interested in.</p>

<p>The last evening I spend looking for a fish restaurant with nice view.
Well, I thought that would be easy. I don't know why, but you can found
everywhere in Oslo McDonald's, Burgerking, 7-Eleven and Restaurant selling
Pizza and Pasta. It took me quite a while to find one, and when I found
one, it had a seaside view, but to the wring direction. I couldn't see
the sunset. So I left the restaurant, and went to the other side of the
bay, back to askerus castle. Where I saw a very beautiful sunset.</p>

<p>I went back to my hotel, slept and left early the next morning for my
flight. Leaving a nice country and a nice folk behind.</p>
