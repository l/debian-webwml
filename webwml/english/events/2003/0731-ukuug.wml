<define-tag intro>

<p>A wide cross-section of the Linux community will gather in
Edinburgh this summer for the UK Unix User Group's annual Linux
technical conference.  It's a great way to keep up-to-date with what's
happening in the world of Linux and to broaden your knowledge. The
low-cost event attracts Linux professionals, systems administrators,
developers and enthusiasts from companies, universities and Linux User
Groups all over the UK, along with a significant number of visitors
from Europe, the US and beyond.</p>
