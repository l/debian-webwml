<h1>Practical Linux, Gieﬂen</h1>

<p>This year, I gave a talk about the installation of Debian GNU/Linux.
Usually I delete all partitions
on my notebook and run a live installation on it, after I talked a little
bit about prejudices and advantages of Debian. Since I didn't had the
opportunity to back up my data (I had several system crashes the week
before), I bit the bullet and installed Debian in Vmware  instead.
Although the textual output was quite slow, it worked very well.</p>

<p>When I finished my talk, I went to the workshop room, where I should
lead a workshop about different apt-tools. Since I lost the prepared foils
and examples I decided to organise it like a BOF (birds of the same feather) session
instead. I had asked all attendees by E-Mail, what they know, want to know
and expect, and came to the conclusion, that they could answer most
questions for themselves.</p>

<p>What I didn't took in account was the workshop room. Communication was
very difficult, too, since it was very noisy. No excuses: I didn't do a
good job there. I later prepared a script <!-- todo: add link --> and sent
it so the attendees. Although it didn't worked very well, we used the room
more than two and a half hours and nobody tried to remove us from the room, so
we used the lunch break, too (when I say "we" I mean the first three rows
and me).</p>

<p>So much for that, I returned to the Debian booth, cleaned a little bit
up. The other volunteer just fixed some posters on the wall which I brought with me, put out his
notebook, and started chatting - in IRC, not to visitors.  Then we started to
answer visitors' questions.</p>

<p>IIRC the orga team told me, they counted about 500 visitors. The Debian
booth was very crowded, but I must confess, that it was just the crowd of
the <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> booth nearby, which stood before our booth. Klaus Knopper himself
found his way to Gieﬂen, and signed Knoppix CDs (and, of course, answered
questions as well).</p>

<p>Nevertheless: Coming to Gieﬂen was worth the trip, especially when I saw,
what Klaus Knopper won in the tombola: <a

professional box :-)</a></p>

<p>After 4pm the exhibition hall emptied very fast. Perhaps because Star
Trek was shown at this time in Germany and geeks went to their TVs. I don't
know.</p>
