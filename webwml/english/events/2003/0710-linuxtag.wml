<define-tag intro>

    <a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
    most important exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers
    Free Software and GNU/Linux.  Three
    years ago the event has interested about 17,000 visitors (15,000
    people were counted in 2001).  The motto is <em>Where .com meets
    .org</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
    professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
    quality gratis conference program.

<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
    middle of the regular exhibition space alongside with company
    booths.  After a long time this is another  opportunity
    to put names and email addresses to faces and personalities.

    <p>It is planned to organize a Debian Day, a one or two days
    conference from and for Debian, that would contain interesting
    talks suited for Debian developers and interested users.
