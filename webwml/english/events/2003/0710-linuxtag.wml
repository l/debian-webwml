<define-tag intro>

    <a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
    most important exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers
    Free Software and GNU/Linux.  Three
    years ago the event has interested about 17,000 visitors (15,000
    people were counted in 2001).  The motto is <em>Where .com meets
    .org</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
    professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
    quality gratis conference program.

<define-tag involve>

    Debian will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
    middle of the regular exhibition space alongside with company
    booths.  After a long time this is another  opportunity
    to put names and email addresses to faces and personalities.  The
    distribution will run on several different hardware platforms and
    many developers will staff the booth.

    <p>A one-day conference called Debian day will be helt on Friday,
    aiming at developers and interested users.  Additionally Andreas
    Tille will maintain a BoF session that discusses ways to integrate
    Knoppix better in Debian.
