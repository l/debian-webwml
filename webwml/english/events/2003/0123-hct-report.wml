<p>The Debian Project was invited to attend this exhibition and
participate actively at a shared booth kindly sponsored by <a
href="http://www.nmmn.com/">New Media Markets &amp; Networks</a>
(NMMN).  Next to our booth were (in no particular order) the KDE Team,
the GNOME Project (represented by Christian Meyer) and PingoS (from
the Gesamtschule Winterhude).  Klaus Knopper demonstrated new features
of his <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> CD
directly inside of the NMMN area.</p>

<h3>Friday, January 24th, 2003</h3>

<p>The Debian booth was set up on Friday. However, setting up the
booth was not an easy task.  Visitors didn't exactly give us time to
complete basic configuration and settling down.  Instead they were so
nice and asked questions and emitted requests for installation, help,
support and suggestions from the beginning.</p>

<p>On Friday we managed to help 4-5 people to install Debian on their
laptops with the most desperate configuration and hardware problems
(such as cdrom not working, unknown and unsupported network cards
etc.).  During the day we also streamed video over a wireless network
demonstrating how this works on GNU/Linux.  Unfortunately the wireless
environment was too much polluted so we weren't able to keep it up and
running during the entire weekend.  During the evening the Debian team
met most of the other guys from the entire booth to share a really
nice dinner.</p>

<h3>Saturday, January 25th, 2003</h3>

<p>On Saturday Debian conquered all the scenes <!-- ??? -->.  We were
really the only booth that was always surrounded by an incredible
amount of visitors.  This time we also had a really nice toy for
demonstration: an SGI Indy that was running our favourite
distribution, of course.  The most exotic hardware, however, was the
Playstation Andreas M&uuml;ller brought with him.  Some kids from the
Gesamtschule Winterhude joined us at the booth and they got the
possibility to play with some games.  Tuxracer was the most popular
one.</p>

<p>A remarkable note needs to be done about a little girl who was able
to create silence among all other visitors around her.  Everyone just
stopped talking and doing things only to look at her and what she was
doing.  The <a href="http://www.linux-debian.de/events/hct_gallery_2003.html">\
pictures</a> we took are the only medium that have the power
give an expression of her playing with <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/gcompris">gcompris</a> coming from
the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Jr.</a> Project.</p>

<p>Saturday evening was also very nice with a meeting organized by <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag e.V.</a> and the Free
Software Foundation.  They invited many people from GNU/ Linux
projects for dinner.  George Greve and Nils Magnus gave short talks
during the dinner.  All people got the possibility to discuss issues,
solutions, problems, directions and ideas.  The GNOME Project, after a
long talk with Klaus Knopper, decided that it would be a good idea to
create a new Knoppix CD that uses GNOME instead of KDE.  Jan Palic
discussed about the future of GNU/Linux on desktop systems, for office
and home environments.  OpenOffice.org emerged, of course, as one of
the most important software that should be present in such
environments.  It was a long evening and the last people left the
restaurant around 1am heading to other parties.</p>

<h3>Sunday, January 26th, 2003</h3>

<p>Sunday was another extremely busy day for the Debian team during
this exhibition, with additional support by Martin 'Joey' Schulze.  He
gave two 2 talks, representing Debian.  The first one covered the
development process and the structure of the project.  The second talk
demonstrated the installation of Debian GNU/Linux on an average x86
based computer.  Andreas MÃ¼ller performed the installation while Joey
explained each step and answered questions.  Even though he was
running out of time at the end of the 45 minutes presentation the
system was completely installed with X and KDE.</p>

<p>NMMN also did several presentations, some of them discussed
OpenOffice.org.  As a consequence Jan Palic got much attention since
he is one of the people working on OpenOffice.org. on a regular basis.
Other representatives from OpenOffice.org also got in touch with us at
the booth and after the talks.</p>

<h3>Next Year</h3>

<p>The next HCT will take place in fall 2004, because of some
reorganisation.  I'm pretty sure, that we will see us there again.</p>
