<p>We had a very successful show overall, and we were very busy for
the two days. We spoke to lots of people, and sold loads of T and polo
shirts and CDs and DVDs. It's nice to see that now we're getting more
existing GNU/Linux and Debian users who are coming to see us to talk or
ask questions, rather than people asking "What's Linux?". We've
(probably) made a small financial loss on the show, but we have lots
of stock remaining that more than offsets that - see the other 2 mails
for more details.</p>
