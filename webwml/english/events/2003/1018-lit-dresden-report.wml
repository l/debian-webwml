<h1><a name="LIT"><a href="http://www.linux-dresden.de">Linux-Info-Tage
Dresden</a></a></h1>

<p>One week later, on the 18th of October, there was an other Linux-Event
in Germany, on which I maned a booth for the Debian Project. Since I forget
to add an entry in the events page, I'll write my small review here:</p>

<p>Joey suggested once, that I shouldn't write so much personal in my
reports. I think I filled the quota of allowed personal stuff in the last
part, so I only tell you the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I remember, that the guys in Dresden offered me accommodation and to pick me up.</li>
  <li>I remember, that I send them a mail, when I'm going to arrive.</li>
  <li>I remember, that I asked in this mail for their phone numbers - just in
case.</li>
  <li>And just when I left the station I remembered, that I neither got a
confirmation of the shuttle-service to my accommodation nor any phone
numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>And to Joey's convenience I won't tell you, what I did between 0:06, when
I arrived in Dresden, and 10am, when this event started ;)</p>

<p>I'll leave this for those, who will write my biography.</p>

<p>All though it was the first time the LUG Dresden organised this event,
they did a very good job!</p>

<p>They organised some good talks - including talks about shell-tools,
Knoppix-remastering and 64-Bit programming - and workshops (including one
about LaTeX). They even organised a small barbecue and small snacks.</p>

<p>They did a very good promotion job, too. I guess that more than 650
people visited this event, and most of them come to our booth at least one
time. I took a box (~125 each) of the CDs, we gave away at <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>, and around 100 flyers.
Additionally I got some Debian pins and stickers from <a
href="http://www.credativ.de">Credativ</a>.</p>

<p>Well, we run out of pins, before the first visitor arrived - they have much
Debian fans in the orga-team and on the other project boothes. We run out
of CDs at noon, and we hadn't one single flyer left till 4pm: Two hours
before this event closed.</p>

<p>You see: We had much visitors and were quite busy.</p>

<p>I think the visitors were a little bit different from those of other
events. Normally many visitors know Debian quite well, and have some kind of
trouble, while the rest know Linux, and like to know what Debian is. This
time, there where many people who didn't even know what Linux is (and
therefore hadn't heard of Debian as well). So we had often to explain what
Linux and free software in general is, what Debian in special is, and ...
well ... what they could try, if they fail to install it.</p>


<p>I think the explanation for this is, that they promoted the LinuxInfoTag
very good at the university - I heard in every lecture they invited the
students at least one time.</p>

<p>There was even a student, who had a problem to install Debian on his
Computer, which had some kind of onboard raid system. IIRC we got in
finally done, when he brought his Computer and we googled a little bit.</p>

<p>Sometimes we run in some troubles when showing some things on my
notebook (which runs a sarge/sid mix), because I completely forgot that I
had a woody-chroot environment prepared.</p>

<p>Of course we had a good time in a student pub after the event, and the
morning we had a guided tour through Dresden, too. All in all it was a very
nice event, and I'm looking forward to travel there next year, too.</p>

<p>Last not least I would like to thank Erik Tews, who volunteered to man
the Debian booth in Dresden. He did a good job, brought his Computer as
well as some other useful equipment (including breakfast and thermos of
coffee).</p>
