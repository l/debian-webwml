<define-tag intro>

<p>The goal of the Libre Software Meeting is to set up a single place
where as many people as possible will be able to share information and
join their energy towards large scale projects.  It is open to
everybody willing to contribute to Free Software: project leaders,
developers, translators, advanced users, etc.  This event is organised
non-commercially by volunteers.  Participation is free in every
meaning of the word.</p>

<define-tag involve>

<p>The Debian project is not officially attending this conference, but
several project members will probably attend, some of them are going
to LinuxTag afterwards.  There should be possibilities to talk to them
and exchange keys.</p>
