<p>The Debian presentation at this year's CeBIT was sponsored by <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/">LinuxLand International</a> this year
as part of their own booth.  Michael 'grisu' Bramer did all the
planning and organization prior to the exhibition. Although many people
offered help staffing the booth, we decided to do a one man show,
since we only had a small presentation table with a single computer
and internet access.</p>

<p>I arrived the day before opening, and got impressed very
fast. Neither had I been at CeBIT nor in Hannover before, but I did
like the international flair of the exhibition and the exhibition
center.</p>

<p>The computer of the demonstration point had been brought by the
people from LinuxLand, too. I just needed to set up a proper Debian
system. I decided to use the stable release and apt-pinning (You might
remember Anthony Towns' <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0303/msg00006.html">\
warning</a>, that things will break, when libc6 moves to testing), but I
had some problems with the graphics card. It was some kind of ATI 128
card, which was not supported by the version of XFree86 4.1 which is part
of Debian stable. I tried to run it with
the VESA and the framebuffer driver, but both times X crashed several
times. Then I found out, that XFree86 4.2 in sarge (testing) does
support this chipset with the ATI driver, and so I installed XFree86
from testing. However, this didn't solve the problem. I began to
believe that the hardware has been damaged during transportation - I
phoned the guy who used this machine daily, but he couldn't provide an
advise either.</p>

<p>Luckily I had my brother's notebook with me.  I already used it for
Debian installation presentations during other events, because it is
very easy to install Debian on it.  If a visitor came up, saying that he would
like to use Debian, but heard it would be so difficult to install, I
could easily place him in front of the laptop, give him a CD and guide
him through the installation, telling him the possible traps and why
the installation is, like it is.</p>

<p>However, since X kept on crashing, I got a little bit panicked, and
wrote a mail that it would be nice to get a replacement machine,
because I would travel home on Sunday and didn't want to leave grisu a
system of which I thought it had hardware problems.</p>

<p>I arrived at my sleeping place shortly before midnight.  A nice
former farm in a suburb of Hannover, owned by the parents of the
Debian fan Johrrit Fahlke.  It's a very nice place to stay.  It is
silent and you can see the stars.  That's something you can't when
you live in central Frankfurt.</p>

<h3>Day 1: Wednesday, March 12th</h3>

<p>I woke up by the farms cat greeting me ... with her claws ...
already at 6 o'clock.  My hosts, teachers at a school next to the
exhibition area, took me there early, since I wanted to try a few
ideas to get that machine running, I even tried a <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a> generated
configuration for X, but it failed as well.</p>

<p>Andreas Tille arrived very early, and tried to fix the X11 problem,
but he also didn't succeed, because the computer decided to run stable
for himself.  Perhaps it only wanted to be touched by a real Debian
developer, not just a guy with to much spare time and a self invented
title.</p>

<p>Andreas installed his <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/xplanet-ltk/">debian-booth</a>
package on the machine. It configures a nice x-planets background and
gives you a couple of good configuration examples (e.g. for sudo).</p>

<p>I can't tell you how much visitors we had during this day, I even
can't estimate their number. There were many people, who heard of
Linux before, but didn't know anything about it.  So I went to hall 11
(which is on the opposite of the area), where Klaus Knopper had his
own cubicle at the common booth of the district Rheinland-Pfalz.  He
was very busy, but I got some boxes of his Knoppix CD, so we could
give them to such people.</p>

<p>There were some visitors, who only wanted to tell us, how much they
like Debian. There was even one person from Korea, who was a real
fan. We discussed a little bit about i18n, and he considered showing
up again, when grisu has arrived. He really wanted to help us, and so
we thought, that he might want to start a Korean translation of the <a
href="http://ddtp.debian.org/">package descriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Thomas Lange, the developer of <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> and several
other developers showed up, Thomas left some FAI flyers, and we talked
a little bit about it, since I try to convert the admins of our
institute to Debian, which is not easy: They use Red Hat, because they
always used Red Hat.  LinuxLand gave Debian developers nice <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/21_fanartikel/debian_fanartikel/debiancap/framify">\
baseball caps</a> and <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/21_fanartikel/debian_fanartikel/debianmousepad/framify">\
mousepads</a> with our swirl for free as they showed up. Even a person
from SuSE stopped by, and asked, if he might buy one.</p>

<p>Although our booth was in the corner of the hall, we had a good
position.  Opened by two sides, much people crossed it going to hall
5 (or the restrooms), and some stopped by at our booth. On the other
side there was the Linux Forum, where some talks were held. So
sometimes, if the talk was interesting, we were idle (and able to take
a look at the talk, too), while our booth was very crowded after the
talk ended. Luckily Andreas Tille stayed nearly the full time at the
booth, and we had much to do, and demonstrated several issues to the
visitors. Sometimes it looked more like a Debian booth, hosting
LinuxLand.</p>

<p>After 5pm the halls emptied very fast, so we could talk a little
bit with the guys in the open booth. Free projects, which didn't had
the luck of big sponsorship, had the possibility to get a (part
time) booth from <a href="http://www.linuxnewmedia.de/">Linux New
Media</a> (LNM). So I talked a little bit with some people from PHP, and
took a small view at NetBSD.</p>

<p>I was very tired this evening, so I left early. Later that evening
I gave my hosts the presents I brought with me: Ebblwoi (spoken
applewoy) and a bembl, and we chatted a little bit, mainly why there
are guys doing such good work, without getting payed in their free
time. That was very nice.</p>

<h3>Day 2: Thursday, March 13th</h3>

<p>A nice thing was the exhibitions supply service. They sent girls
with sandwiches, drinks and coffee to the booths (of course they were
not cheap), and you could get bigger thermos of coffee, too.</p>

<p>On this day Alexander "formorer" Wirt showed up, and stayed a while
at the booth with me as well as acting for Klaus Knopper, while Klaus
had some important dates. Again we were quite busy, but this time we
didn't had the opportunity to listen to the talks.  However, later I
heard that the keynote by Jon 'maddog' Hall was a highlight, and that
one guy from <a href="http://www.ximian.com/">Ximian</a> gave a nice
talk, why Microsoft's license politics are working for Ximian.</p>

<p>Later this day, when the hall became less crowded, I demonstrated 
two or three installation walk-throughs for interested visitors.
After that I talked a little bit with people from <a
href="http://www.gnome-de.org/">GNOME</a>. They are quite impressed by
the Debian packages of GNOME, "which are very fast and stable but a
little bit outdated", so we had a good conversation while eating.
They love Debian (one them even wore a Debian <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/21_fanartikel/debian_fanartikel/debianshirtxl/framify">\
T-Shirt</a> from LinuxLand) and I like GNOME as well.</p>

<h3>Day 3: Friday, March 14th</h3>

<p>At this point I stopped writing my diary in the evening. I can't remember
anything unusual happening during this day...  Oh, wait!  There is one funny
thing to tell: LinuxLand sells a <a
href="http://www.linuxland.de/katalog/01_linuxdistri_bs/debian/debian30/framify">\
boxed Debian version</a>. The boxes look very nice. A student, who already
burnt Debian CDs, really wanted such a nice box, but could not afford buying
one. LinuxLand gave much stuff away for addresses for their newsletter (they
are still a company and want to make money), so Franz from LinuxLand made the
joke, he could have one, if he would gave them his address, and I added the
joke, that I would get a donation, because you can read on the box, that our
project gets &euro;&nbsp;2.00. I don't know he understood, that we were
joking, since he did both: He left his address and gave me
&euro;&nbsp;2.00. ;)</p>

<p>I remember, how visitors changed on this Friday. There where not just
business people, but also "normal" people and many students. Some stopped by
to get their key signed by a Debian developer because they considered becoming
a Debian developer as well. I complicated the things a little bit, since I am
not a Debian developer (yet). But as far as I can remember, every time this
happened, I found a Debian developer nearby.</p>

<p>Did I mention, that we had much questions, which were not Debian specific?
Of course, there were Knoppix-related questions (I can't unmount my harddisk,
etc.), which were easy to answer. After answering them, I told the questioners
that the new version of Knoppix ships with <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/selflinux">Selflinux</a> (Klaus Knopper even placed a
shortcut on the desktop). Hence, often I booted Knoppix on the notebook,
demonstrating it, while also showing normal Debian related things on the
demonstration machine from LinuxLand.</p>

<p>After the show, the people from LinuxLand, LNM and Max, the moderator of
the Linux-Forum, went to a nice American diner. They have nice looking female
waitresses, wearing short skirts... Oh, and the food is good, too. ;) We
visited a pub nearby for some darts, and that took a long time, since Franz
didn't let us go, before he won against every one of us.</p>

<h3>Day 4: Saturday, March 15th</h3>

<p>Did I mention the good coffee supply? It was a treat on that morning!</p>

<p>Luckily we were too busy to get tired. Grisu had already arrived, and Frank
Ronneburg, who wrote the German <a
href="http://www.openoffice.de/linux/buch/">Debian Anwender Handbuch</a>
arrived early, too. So we had enough manpower to stand against the crowd of
arriving visitors on that day. Today this definitively was a Debian booth,
while LinuxLand was reduced to only a small table.  The amount of
visitors was really impressive.</p>

<p>I think I installed Debian more than four times on this day, every time
explaining the same things, making the same jokes. That became a little bit
boring, but I don't think our visitors became aware of it.</p>

<p>Sometimes newbies (or even wannabe newbies) asked which distribution they
should use, and I usually pointed them to the LUGs. I showed them the Pro-Linux
<a href="http://www.pl-berichte.de/lugs/">list of LUGs</a> and told them, that
it would be the best for newcomers, to install, what their LUG is using. So
they find a good reference in their LUG if they encounter problems, and they
don't waste money, since they can get a copy from one of their LUG.</p>

<p>On that evening, we went to that American diner again (because of the milk
shakes, not the waitresses!) but it was a little bit difficult to find. The
day before that I took a flyer, and found out, that they didn't list their
address (but show a waitress). Very strange marketing.</p>

<h3>Day 5: Sunday, March 16th</h3>

<p>This was my last day, and since my presence was not needed, I slept long
and had the opportunity to have breakfast with my hosts, after refusing to do
so the last days under time pressure. Again, it was nice to have a talk with
them (this time mostly about politics, especially those of the United States).</p>

<p>The rest of the forenoon I took a look at the exhibition myself. Of course,
I couldn't stop being at work, and always asked if I could purchase a
computer without operating system and such things.</p>

<p>On my way home the train had some technical problems, and while sitting
together with other railway customers I got another opportunity for improvised
talks about Free Software in general and GNU/Linux in particular. So I gave away a
big part of the Knoppix CDs I took with me, before even arriving at home.</p>

<p>Last thing to mention: Donations. One guy wanted to get a quittance, so I
pointed him to the <a href="http://www.ffis.de/Verein/spi-de.html">ffis
site</a>. We received a couple of small donations from visitors and
&euro;&nbsp;50.00 from LinuxLand, which I got for food, but didn't use at all.
Summa summarum: &euro; 61.</p>

<h3>Day 4: Saturday, March 15th</h3>

<p>A friend drove to CeBIT with his son and asked me if I would join
him. I said yes and we made an appointment for 5:30 in the
morning. After 3 hours by car we arrived in Hannover and they visited
the CeBIT.  I had to wait for  20 Minutes until Britta from 
LinuxLand came to the entrance with the CeBIT tickets. </p>

<h3>Days 5-8: Sunday, March 16th - Wednesday, March 19th</h3>

<p>I don't write this diary on a daily basis. Sorry, but I can't
reconstruct the chronological order of the events.</p>

<p>After some breakfast I drove to CeBIT. But first I made a break at
the central station and bought a sixpack of water. Tuesday I bought
the second sixpack. Yes, I was drinking all the time at the
booth...</p>

<p>Like at other booths in the past some visitors asked certain questions
about Debian. They all start with a sentences like this: 'Now I have
SuSE|Red Hat|Mandrake on my computer, and all the time I read
about this "APT". Can you show us something about this and Debian...'
Ok, this was a simple task every time, I showed it and other visitors
could watch.</p>

<p>We also had some normal Windows users at the booth. They don't use
GNU/Linux at all and asked general questions about it. We also had some
GNU/Linux or Debian users who asked technical questions. I did my best to
answer them.</p>

<p>However, this time we also experienced a new class of visitors. I will call
this class 'Knoppix user'.  (A bit of background for you: In Germany a
big computer magazine with a circulation of 500,000 put the Knoppix CD
in the issue that was published directly before CeBIT.  Knoppix is a Debian-based live CD, has very
good hardware detection and an installer.  At CeBIT the publisher also
distributed some thousand Knoppix CDs.)  These visitors say things
like this: 'I tried Linux [Red Hat|SuSE|...]  in the last years several
times, but it was broken. Now I tried this CD and it's running. This
is very nice. Now I will try the real Debian..."  First of all this is
very good. Knoppix leads the normal computer user to Debian and GNU/Linux
in general. But I can't give these users a good answer. I can't
propose Debian, they can't install it, it doesn't have any hardware
detection, it has an old version of XFree86. You know the story. We should
think about this problem and we should not disregard the
public...</p>

<p>During the entire exhibition time we exchanged digital keys with other Debian developers, KDE
people and 'normal' visitors. Some businessmen asked 'What are you
doing?' so I explained the magic of gpg and the web of trust.</p>

<p>Sometimes I had to defend Debian: Some people who don't speak
English don't like English debconf messages in the second stage of the
woody installer (the first stage is non-English). And one old Debian
user bought new hardware and now his X doesn't run...</p>

<p>You also know the usual questions: 'When will sarge be released?' 
and you know the usual answer. :-) In general the spirit was very
good. Some businesses and some (German) government offices try to use
GNU/Linux as both server and desktop systems. All the time we had visitors
at our booth and in the Linux Park.</p>
   
<p>At one time a Russian man visited the booth and asked for Russian
language support in Debian. Ah, sorry, I don't know about this. I never did
this.  But a <kbd>apt-cache search</kbd> showed some packages, I installed one
and yes, we could type Russian (and English) letters. Nice, I love
Debian.</p>

<p>On the last day, Andreas Tille helped a second time at the booth.
Thanks to Andreas for that. IMHO two persons at the booth are
better.</p>
   
<p>The booth was a success and Debian should make a demo point next
year again, if possible with two Debian persons per day.</p>
