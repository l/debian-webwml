# $Id$

<p>The Debian Project was present at this event with a booth and quite
a lot of developers used this as a meeting point.  The event was hosted at
the <a href="http://www.ulb.be/">Université Libre de
Bruxelles</a>.</p>

<h3>Saturday, February 8th, 2003</h3>

<p>The event started with a keynote by John 'maddog' Hall who talked
about the History of Free Software.  After this introduction Richard
M. Stallman discussed Software Patents.</p>

<p>Several interesting talks took place on Saturday (e.g. Gnome,
PostgreSQL, Bugzilla, ...).  For Debian Martin Michlmayr
gave a presentation on embian (Embedded Debian).  The Debian booth was
staffed with at least five people so we had the chance to talk to every
visitor.  Thanks to Rémi Letot for organizing the nice stand.  Russell Coker
brought a machine running SE Linux (Security Enhanced Linux) for some sort of
"Capture The Flag" action and made it available for the meeting.  He was
willing to give away an award for the first person who was able to compromise
the box.  There was of course no need for that.</p>

<p>The evening ended with a nice dinner and some beer at a piano bar
with some Belgian locals.</p>

<h3>Sunday, February 9th, 2003</h3>

<p>In the morning Raphaël Hertzog gave a talk about the DebianEdu
subproject which attracted quite a lot of people for such an early
lecture.  He explained why DebianEdu is a good meeting point
for all educational initiatives that are popping up in local context.
During the rest of the day there was a lot of nice chatting at
the Debian booth.  Additionally, Russell gave an unscheduled
talk about SE Linux which attracted some visitors too. Thanks to
FOSDEM's flexibility and reactivity for that.</p>
