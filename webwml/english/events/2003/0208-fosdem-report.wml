# $Id$

<p>The Debian Project was present at this event with a booth and quite
a lot of developers used this as a meeting point.  The event was hosted at
the <a href="http://www.ulb.be/">Université Libre de
Bruxelles</a>.</p>

<h3>Saturday, February 8th, 2003</h3>

<p>The event started with a keynode from John 'maddog' Hall who talked
about the History of Free Software.  After this introduction Richard
Stallman gave a talk discussing the history of the Free Software
Foundation.</p>

<p>Several interesting talks took place on Saturday (e.g. Gnome,
PostgreSQL, Bugzilla, ...).  For Debian Martin Michmayr (alias tbm)
gave a talk about embian (Embedded Debian).  Our booth was
staffed with at least five Debian people so we had the chance to talk to every
visitor.  Thanks to Rémi Letot who organized the nice stand.  Russel
brought a nice machine for some sort of "Capture The Flag" action and
made it available for the meeting.  This was a box running a flavour
of SE Linux (Security Enhanced Linux).  He was willing to give away an
award for the first person who was able to compromise the box and get
root on it.  There was no need award it, of course.</p>

<p>The evening ended with a nice dinner and some beer at a piano bar
with some Belgian locals.</p>

<h3>Sunday, February 9th, 2003</h3>

<p>In the morning, Raphaël Hertzog gave a talk about the DebianEdu
subproject which attracted quite a lot of people for such an early
conference. He explained why DebianEdu is a good meeting point
for all educational initiatives that are popping up in local context.
During the rest of the day there were a lot of nice talks and chat at
the Debian booth.  Additionally, Russel Coker gave a completely unplanned
talk about SE Linux which attracted quite a few visitors. Thanks to
FOSDEM's flexibility and reactivity for that.</p>
