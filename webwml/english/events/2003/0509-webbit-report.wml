booths</a> near the OpenBSD and BeOS people.  Both areas had about 20
rooms were people from various communities and from companies held a
total of 1000+ workshops.</p>

<p>During the opening hours we meet a lot of people interested in Free
Software, installed Debian on some machines, signed GPG keys,
participated (and held) workshops and showed to visitors a cluster of
4 <a

Xbox machines</a> running Debian.</p>

<p>During the nights members of various communities gathered to hack
(a little), chat (some in real life, some on IRC) and enjoy Padova.</p>

<p>A big thank to all Debian developers and users that participated.</p>
