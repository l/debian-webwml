#use wml::debian::template title="Running a booth"

<p>The most important task for project members to represent the Debian
project on an exhibition is to run a booth for Debian.  This is quite
easy since it is sufficient for a very simple booth to hook up a machine
running Debian GNU/Linux and somebody explaining things.  It is,
however, recommended that at least two people staff the booth and you
use posters and flyers along with some more machines.

<p>Trade shows and conferences often provide a place where a couple of
developers can meet, even if they are located far away normally.
Often foreign developers are invited to hold a talk, so even these
people can be met there.  Additionally it has always been fun going to
a pub with other developers and just talk about improving Linux' inode
cache or dpkg's dependency resolution.

<p>For many events, people have created additional web pages and
mailing lists to help them plan and run the booth.  Please check the
links to ``coordination'' on our pages for upcoming and past events to
get an idea about this.  Please also check out our <a

<h3>Mailing Lists</h3>
</a>

<p>The Debian project provides two mailing lists for coordinating
events:

<p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/">debian-events-eu</a>,
       dedicated to Europe and european events.
  <li> <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-events-na/">debian-events-na</a>,
       dedicated to Northern America and events on that continent.
</ul>

<p>To subscribe to either of these lists, check out our <a
