# $Id$

<p>The most important task for project members to represent the Debian
project on an exhibition is to run a booth for Debian.  This is quite
easy since it is sufficient for a very simple booth to hook up a machine
running a Debian GNU system (either Linux, Hurd or *BSD will fit) and
somebody explaining how it works and answering questions.  It is,
however, recommended that at least two people staff the booth and that
you use posters and flyers along with some more machines.</p>

<p>Trade shows and conferences often provide a place where a couple of
developers can meet, even if they are located far away from the main
conference or exhibition.
Often foreign developers are invited to give a talk, so even these
people can be met there.  Additionally it has always been fun going to
a pub with other developers and just talk about improving Linux' inode
cache or dpkg's dependency resolution.

<p>For many events, people have created additional web pages and
mailing lists to help them plan and run the Debian presence.  Please check the
links to &ldquo;coordination&rdquo; on our pages for upcoming and past events to
get an idea about this.  Please also read our <a

<h3><a name="ml">Mailing Lists</a></h3>

<p>The Debian project provides two mailing lists for coordinating
Debian's involvement at various events:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-eu/">debian-events-eu</a>,
       dedicated to Europe and European events.
  <li> <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-events-na/">debian-events-na</a>,
       dedicated to Northern America and events on that continent.
</ul>

<p>To subscribe to either of these lists, check out our <a
