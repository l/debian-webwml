<define-tag intro>

"UKUUG-Linux99 is a conference organised for the Linux community by the UK Unix
Users Group. Its aim is to bring together developers, users and businesses 
interested in Linux, and to provide a series of talks, forums and clinics
that promise to be both interesting and useful to those using or intending 
to use Linux." [<A HREF="http://www.linux.ukuug.org/linux99/">UKUUG-Linux99</A>] 

Looks like a lot of fun!
