<define-tag intro>
        Systems 99 is going to have an area for linux people and they have invited Debian to attend.
        This expo is mapped out with a different design that features a linux cafe as well as standard expo booths.  
        If you are not attending at least check out the website and have a
look at their <A href="http://www.linux-magazin.de/systems/en/index_html">design.</A>
	<!--German Translators should put a "real" intro in here-->
        <!--And change the links to german versions.-->
