<define-tag intro>
The Linux/Unix Users' Group of Virginia Tech, located in Blacksburg, Va.,
is holding a Linux/*BSD InstallFest.  We'll be installing from 11:00 AM
till 5:00 PM on Saturday, March 27th, 1999.  The InstallFest will be
located in Rooms 341 and 345 of Squires Student Center (the university
student union building, a.k.a. SUB) on the campus of Virginia Tech.
We're proud to announce that at least one Debian developer will be
attending our IF, so this is your chance to meet an official developer!

<p>
An InstallFest is a one day event where PC owners can bring their
systems in to a central location to have an alternate operating system
installed for a "test-drive."  In most cases, Linux, FreeBSD, etc., can be
installed on a user's hard drive and the system configured so that s/he can
"dual-boot" to both WindowsTM and the new OS.  That way you can try out Linux
or BSD without losing the ability to run WindowsTM while you're still
learning about your new OS.

<p>
We plan to install the Debian, Red Hat, and Slackware Linux distributions
and also FreeBSD.  We expect to perform about 15 installations in six
hours.  In addition, we'll also have a special "Fix-It Corner" where
we'll have several Linux hardware and software gurus available.  They'll
try to solve your most vexing Linux problems ranging from problematic
hardware to broken software and configurations.

<p>
Pre-registration is *mandatory* and can be done in person or on-line at
http://corvette.me.vt.edu/installfest.perl.  The application contacts are
Parris Wood <pwood@vt.edu> and Lally Singy <lally@vt.edu>.  No
pre-registration, no installation, no exceptions.  We have to know what
hardware and how many installs and system repairs to expect.  Note that
installation availability is on a first-come, first-served basis, so
please apply early!  We will turn away overflow crowds and point them to
our next InstallFest.

<p>
You should plan to present identification at the door and check in and out of
the InstallFest room itself because we want to ensure security for people who
bring their PCs to the InstallFest.  Our two main goals are professional,
easy-to-use OS installations and protection of the hardware people bring to
the event for an installation or loan to L/UUG of VT for our use.

<p>
For directions, e-mail us.  Generally, we're located about 35 miles SW of
Roanoke, Virginia, about 50 miles east of Bluefield, West Virginia, and about
200 miles ENE of Knoxville, Tennessee.  We're located conveniently close to US
Interstate 81, on US Route 460.  Check out www.mapsonus.com to pull up maps of

Debian would like to contribute some CDs for this event, and, if possible,
have some people to help install and demonstrate Debian on hand.
