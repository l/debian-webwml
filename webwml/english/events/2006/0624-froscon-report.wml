#use wml::debian::template title="Free and Open Source Software Conference -- Report"

<p>The <a href="http://www.inf.fh-brs.de/">Department for Computer
Science</a> of the <a href="http://www.fh-brs.de/">University of Applied Sciences
Bonn-Rhein-Sieg</a>, their <a
href="http://www.stud.inf.fh-brs.de/">students association</a> and the <a
href="http://www.luusa.org/">Linux / Unix User group Sankt Augustin</a>
organised their first <a href="http://www.froscon.de/">conference</a> this
weekend in Sankt Augustin, Germany.  The conference itself was nice, and
the building was nice as well.  Several small booths were located at the
<q>University Highway</q>, a large foyer.</p>

<p>The program schedule looked very interesting and there were about five
official tracks in parallel.  In addition to that, there were
sub-conferences by Debian, Zope, KDE, and I've also seen PHP.  As a
result, the auditorium usually was quite small as this was also the first
such event and hence not that well visited yet.  The event looked a
lot like one of the first <a href="http://www.linuxtag.org/">LinuxTag</a>
events which were only small university events some ten years ago.</p>

<p>The Debian project participated and maintained a booth giving away
freebies and selling merchandise.  However, due to the relatively low
number of visitors and the large number of parallel talks usually there
were not too many people visiting the exhibition.  The Debian project also
maintained a one-day conference that attracted a few visitors.  Alexander
Wirt managed to get some pretzels that looked like Debian swirls which
visitors could take for eating.</p>
