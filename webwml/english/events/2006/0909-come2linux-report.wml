#use wml::debian::template title="Come 2 Linux -- Report"

<p>Come 2 Linux has been proven to be a well organised and well received
exhibition and conference in the Ruhr area.  All major Free Software
projects were present to inform the visitors.  The conference consisted of
three tracks in parallel and about 30-60 visitors sat in each talk.</p>

<p>The Debian project gave two talks, the first one was an introduction in
Debian and the second went more into details.  Both were well received.
Four people staffed the booth and answered visitors questions.  There
weren't too many visitors in the exhibition area all the time so that we
were able to talk with the interested ones for a while.  Often there was
no pressure to end the chat in order to handle the next visitor.</p>
