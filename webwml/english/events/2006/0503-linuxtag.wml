<define-tag intro>

<p><a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/>LinuxTag</a> is the largest and
most important exhibition and conference in Europe, which covers
Free Software and GNU/Linux.  The motto is <em>Where .COM meets
.ORG</em>.  LinuxTag combines both a community event as well as a
professional exhibition with large amounts of business and a high
quality gratis conference program.</p>

<define-tag involve>

<p>The Debian project will be present with a booth.  It will be located in the
middle of the regular exhibition space alongside with company
booths.  After a long time this is another opportunity in Europe
to put a large number of names and email addresses to faces
and personalities.  <!-- The Debian project will demonstrate its distribution
running on different hardware platforms, but most non-i386
architectures will be demonstrated on the Linux Ports booth. -->Many
developers will staff both booths.</p>

<!-- p>A two-day conference called Debian day will be held on Thursday and Friday, aiming at developers and interested users. </p -->
