<define-tag intro>
    As every year Pluto is organizing a conference on matters relating
    to Free Software.  This year <a

    held between December 9th and 11th in the Multimedia Center of the
    Italian city of Terni.  The Meeting is defining itself as the
    meeting point between the Italian Free Software Community and the
    enterprise sector and will center around talks, courses and
    exibitions (both of commercial companies and Free Software
