<define-tag intro>
	<a href=http://www.linuxtag.org/2000/english/>LinuxTag</a> is one of the biggest
	Linux events in Europe. There were about 7000 visitors last year and there
	will be even more this year. This is also a reason why the event moved
	from the University of Kaiserslautern, Germany to Stuttgart.
	LinuxTag aimes for the beginners but also for the advanced users and
	business men. So, everybody should gain something from visiting the
	Linuxtag.

<define-tag involve>
	Debian will be present with a booth. It will be located in the free
	software group's hall where also the other free software projects are.
	Last year we were about 20 people, maybe we can top this this year :-).
	There is also a <a href=http://www.infodrom.north.de/Debian/debian-events-de/>mailinglist</a> 
	which discusses the presentation of Debian at events. It is just a 
	mailinglist for events in Germany. If you are not a native German speaker,
	don't worry, stuff which could also bother other people is discussed in
	English like preparing for LinuxTag :-).
