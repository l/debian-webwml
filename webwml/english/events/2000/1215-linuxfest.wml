<define-tag intro>
    The main aim of the event is to educate people and promote Linux
    in a country that has been left far behind the technological
    advancements because of the political situation for the past
    decade.  LinuxFEST is organised by a group of Linux enthousiasts
    who believe that Linux should come to Yugoslavia on a large scale
    and not be employed only in research organisations, universities
    and among a few 'geeks'.  The event will comprise a full research
    conference, promotional talks, exhibitions and install fest.
    LinuxFEST is a completely non-profit generating event and is
    actualy funded by the organizers themselves and several sponsors.
