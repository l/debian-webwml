<p>The <a href="http://www.froscon.de/">Free and Open Source Software
Conference</a> (FrOSCon) is a community and end-user oriented event in
Germany that is organised with a much love.  It consists of an
exhibition and a conference program together with developer rooms used
for sub-conferences by various projects.</p>

<p>We have shared the Debian booth with the well known <a
href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">FAI</a> project.  All boths
consisted of one or two tables and were already prepared with network and
power supplies so they could be set up in time on Saturday, the first
conference day.</p>

<p>We've used a large display for demonstration since the booth was not
large enough for using the video projector.  The size was fine,
nevertheless.  We were able to sit behind the booth when no visitors were
around and were able to demonstrate things when people rushed by after the
talks ended.</p>

<p>Many visitors knew Debian already and were awaiting the new release.
Several people asked very detailed questions that we answered and
demonstrated on the demo machine.</p>

<p>FrOSCon is a nice place to stay in touch with other projects and to
meet developers of other projects so problems and development could be
discussed face-to-face.  The neighbour booths were used by <a
href="http://www.grml.org/">grml</a> and <a href="http://www.sidux.de/">\
sidux</a> on one side and by GUUG on the other side.  We've had good
discussions with people from those.</p>

<p>Several people spoke with us about the unfortunate OpenSSL problem
earlier this year.  Interestingly, nobody was angry about it and many
people expressed their respect for the Debian project's handling of the
problem.</p>
