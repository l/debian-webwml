<define-tag intro>
<p>
Our favorite distribution is 15 years old. To celebrate this
event of higher importance, we will have a meeting of Debianists and
sympathizers: the DebianDayPT2008 on August 16, which will take place in Aveiro, Portugal.

<define-tag involve>

<p>
We will have the opportunity to exchange experiences and knowledge on
our distribution. There will also be room for presentations and workshops
on the themes / knowledge who want to share. Everyone is invited
to bring the computer and show what (and what not) one can do.
We will share knowledge and experiences. We will have a gift for
volunteers to do some kind of lecture or workshop.
</p>

<p>Everyone is invited to help, in the good spirit of Free Software.</p>
