#use wml::debian::template title="Checklist for a booth"

<p>This list intends to help people organizing a booth for the Debian
project at any exhibition.  Please send comments to <a
href="mailto:events@debian.org">events@debian.org</a>.

<h3>Organizing a booth</h3>

<p>This list is ordered.  However, some items can be done in parallel,
of course, some other can be done in different order.

<ol>

<li> Are there other people who would like to run a booth for Debian
     as well?  It only makes sense if there are two or more people.  If nobody
     else wants to or could help, please reconsider running a booth.

<li> Now that there are some people who will help at the booth, will
     some of them bring a machine with them?  If not, please
     reconsider running the booth, since without machines it'll be
     quite empty.

<li> Now when both people and machines are available, it is time to contact
     the administration and ask them about a free booth for the
     project.

<li> Please ensure that the booth will actually have furniture.

<li> Check if there will be walls to put posters on.

<li> Please ensure that the booth will have a power plug.

<li> If available at no-cost or low cost, ask for IP connectivity if
     you consider it useful for the booth.

<li> If posters can be used, check out if you can afford printing
     large posters or get some sent to you.  For Germany, <a
     href="joey@debian.org">Joey</a> has a couple of posters he can
     send to you via yellow post.

<li> Check out if you can afford phrasing, designing and printing
     flyers so that visitors can take something with them.  For
     Europe, Joey has bilingual (English and German) flyers made by <a
     href="http://www.mixad.it/">Mixad</a> he can send around.

<li> If it is a large exhibition, check if somebody wants to produce
     Debian CDs for visitors.  Check out if you can find sponsors to
     pay for the production so visitors can get them without a fee.

<li> If somebody will be at the booth who is capable of holding a talk
     covering Debian in general or a specific angle of the project,
     ask him to sign up at the administration if they would like to
     accept this talk.

<li> Contact events@debian.org so we can add the event to our events
     pages.

<li> Consider with the administration how many tables and chairs are
     required at the booth.

<li> Please ensure that there will be enough power splitters at the
     booth so the will machines actually be able to be turned on.

<li> Please ensure that there will be enough network cables and
     hubs/switches at the booth so the boxes can be connected - and
     connected with upstream if possible.

<li> Bare tables don't look nice, you may want to consider using white
     table cloths so the whole booth will look more professional.

<li> Some events organize a social event for speakers and exhibitors.
     Check out if there will be one and how you can attend there if
     you are interested.  As a rule of thumb: A social events usually
     is quite nice since you meet people from other projects/companies
     and can relax outside of a stressful exhibition.

<li> Please ensure to take enough fingerprints of your GnuPG key with
     you so others can <a href="keysigning">sign</a> it.  Please also
     don't forget a passport or drivers license to prove your
     identity.

</ol>

<p>Mails covering organization of the booth and talks should be sent
to one of the <a href="booth#ml">mailing lists</a> so they get
publically recognized, archived and can attract more interested people
to attend.

<p>If you don't want to send such mails to a public list, you can
always send them to events@debian.org so we can give some hints to you
if required or useful.  We won't step in contacting the administration
bypassing your effort though.

<h3>Running a booth</h3>

<ul>

<li> If you want to run a professional booth, it is always good to
     know where to put jackets, superflous shoes, drinks and other
     stuff.  Please contact the administration if there will be a
     small room for it.

<li> Please check with the administration how you can get to the booth
     during the show before it has opened to the public.  Some
     exhibitions require special exhibitor-passports.

<li> At the exhibition the ration developers per visitors should not
     be over two (2.0).  It's nice to have a booth full of people, but
     it's not very inviting if the booth is already filled up with
     Debian people and no visitor is able to get in.

<li> When the day is over or at the end of the show, please don't
     return a booth full of junk like empty bottles and stuff.

</ul>
