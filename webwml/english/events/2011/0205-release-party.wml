<define-tag involve>

<p>
Debian Users, Contributors and Developers will meet and celebrate all over
the world!  Meetings in bars, pizzerias and alike are common; at
some you can also get CDs/DVDs burned, exchange GPG fingerprints or listen
to ad hoc introductions to specific topics.  All in all:  a great
opportunity to meet people and become part of a vibrant and cheerful
community!
</p>

<p>There will also be a live ticker commenting the process of the release
via <a href="http://identi.ca/debian">Debian official identi.ca</a>
account.</p>
