<define-tag intro>

<p>FOSDEM (Free and Open Source Developers European Meeting) is a free
and non-commercial event for the community and organized by the community.
Its goal is to provide Free and Open Source developers and communities a
place to meet to:</p>

<ul>

<li>get in touch with other developers and projects,</li>

<li>get informed about the latest developments in the Free and Open Source world,</li>

<li>attend interesting talks and presentations held in large conference
rooms by Free and Open Source project leaders and committers on various
topics,</li>

<li>and to promote the development and the benefits of Free and Open Source
solutions.</li>

</ul>

<p>A booth has been requested and assigned, where members of the Debian project will
present the upcoming release Debian 6.0 <q>Squeeze</q>.  Of special
interest for attendees might be the presentation of the newly introduced
port <q>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</q> of the Debian operating system to the
FreeBSD Kernel.</p>

<p>Since 2010, Debian has not received a Developers' room (nor has any other
Linux distribution, for that matter); instead, a multi-distribution
<q>miniconference</q> will be created that we've been invited to participate
in. People interested in holding talks during this miniconference, should read <a href='http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2010/09/msg00010.html'>the call for talks</a>.</p>
