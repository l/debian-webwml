<p>This page contains a list of all the different merchandising materials
 people organizing Debian booths can use (so they do not have to make them
 from scratch):</p>

<toc-display />


<toc-add-entry name="posters">Posters</toc-add-entry>

<p>Posters really dress up your booth pretty well, so you should take
some time and print a few. Also, if you take appropriate precautions,
they can be used from time to time at different events. If you do
not want to keep them you can always give them away in a
BOF (Birds of a Feather) meeting.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:arti@kumria.com">Arti Kumria</a> designed the following
posters for <a href="http://www.linuxexpo.com.au/">LinuxExpo Australia</a>,
which was held in March of 2000 in Sydney:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="materials/posters/poster1.pdf">poster1.pdf</a> [182 kB]
  <li><a href="materials/posters/poster1.ps.gz">poster1.ps.gz</a> [16.3 MB]
  <li><a href="materials/posters/poster2.pdf">poster2.pdf</a> [175 kB]
  <li><a href="materials/posters/poster2.ps.gz">poster2.ps.gz</a> [16.3 MB]
</ul>

<p>Each of these PostScript files is approximately 277 MB uncompressed.
<strong>You have been warned!</strong></p>

<p>The posters were originally printed at
<a href="http://www.kinkos.com/">Kinkos</a>, and it took about 45 minutes
(including lamination), so make sure you leave plenty of time to get them
done. Total turnaround time was 36 hours from submission to Kinkos until
Anand had them in his hands.</p>

<p>The preview PDF files give a good representation of what the poster looks
like, except the Debian swirl turns out pink instead of red. It does look
good when printed (but be sure and get a printing proof from Kinkos).</p>

<p>The posters above are released into the public domain. If you want to
acquire the original data used to create them, please contact
<a href="mailto:akumria@debian.org">Anand Kumria</a>.</p>

<P>For Germany, <a href="mailto:joey@debian.org">Joey</a> has a
couple of <a
href="http://cvs.infodrom.org/goodies/posters/?cvsroot=debian">posters</a>
he can send to you via yellow post, but only on loan
and only for a Debian booth at an exhibition.</p>

<p>Thimo Neubauer also provided a <a
href="materials/posters/worldmap/">world map</a> with coordinates for
Debian developers.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="flyers">Flyers and Pamphlets</toc-add-entry>

<p>People like to take things away from the booths, and even if you can't
afford to give away more costly things (see below) you can always
provide flyers. Flyers have the ability to solve many questions
regarding to Debian, can entice people to contribute and for it's
paper they can take notes on it! All in all, they are pretty useful.</p>

<p>Sources for a multilingual flyer, as well as instructions for printing are
available from the <a href="http://debian-flyers.alioth.debian.org/">Debian
Flyers webpage</a>.</p>

<p>For pamphlets, there are <a href="materials/pamphlets/">AbiWord files</a>
available for both English and Spanish that can be easily translated into
any other language as well.</p>

<p>For Europe, Michael Meskes maintains a printed version of  bilingual
(English and German) flyers made by Debian people during preparations
for <a href="2002/0606-linuxtag">LinuxTag 2002</a>. Even if
your event takes place in a country of which none of the above are native
tongues, they will probably help people understand the Debian project
and you can always translate them into your own language.  These
printed flyers may be requested by <a href="mailto:meskes@debian.org">\

<toc-add-entry name="stickers">Stickers</toc-add-entry>

<p>One of the things people appreciate most at a booth are stickers.
Debian stickers are quite handy because they
can be used to put your favorite OS image on laptops, monitors or
servers (Note: stickers with transparent background are quite cooler
than those with white background).</p>

<P>You can use both the <a href="$(HOME)/logos/">logos</a> (under the conditions
outlined) or any of the available <a href="materials/stickers/">stickers</a>.
In the subdirectory <a href="materials/stickers/pages/">pages</a> you will
find the source for creating a page full of logos which can be useful to
print in a normal (color) printer with adhesive paper.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software
Foundation</a> has some cool stickers saying <em>GNU protected</em>,
<em>GNU &amp; Linux - the dynamic duo</em> and <em>GNU/Linux
inside</em> that nobody should miss, really.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="foilstickers">Foil stickers</toc-add-entry>

<p>A great thing to use with a booth are stickers. But the majority
of them are just printed and often get destroyed by sunlight, water or
dirt. A foil label is a glued foil which will be cut into shapes with a
special kind of plotter. Thus, there is no white, transparent, or whatever,
background at all - just the foil. Therefore, they are great to put on
laptops, cars, public  boxes at the booth, the booth in general or
whatever.</p>

<p>Another advantage is the variable scale. Most possible sizes are
from about 3&nbsp;cm up to 1.20&nbsp;m varying from the plotter's size.</p>

<p>The stickers can be used to make the booth look better; you can
also use smaller ones to give away to visitors, etc.</p>

<p>The stickers are cheap to produce, but their cash value is high,
so it's very good to sell them or to give away for donations.</p>

<p>Linux Wochen 2003 (Austria), Linux Tag 2003 (Germany) and Linux
World Expo 2003 (Germany) have shown that visitors like them very
much and are willing to give a donation.</p>

<p>You can get additional information, samples and files (especially
trimmed for smaller swirls) at
<url "http://people.debian.org/~seppy/foilstickers/" />.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="cards">Business cards for developers</toc-add-entry>

<p>Since the people (developers or not) who dedicate quite some time
to Debian from their spare time it is nice to prepare
a gift for them.  A Debian business card is a cool
thing to show and fills the people who own one with some sort of pride!</p>

<p>Also, people who are in charge of organizing events
and booths and get in touch with many other project leaders and
coordinators during social events can exchange their business cards.
Giving out business cards with the Debian
logo contributes to Debian's image and is useful for handing out important
information that you usually have to scribble down on paper (such as email address,
your GPG fingerprint...).</p>

<P>There is a <a href="materials/business-cards/">prototype</a> for
business cards which you can use. Customizing it is easy since you only have
to edit the <tt>card.tex</tt> file with the personal data and simply run
<tt>latex card.tex</tt>. Check out the
<a href="materials/business-cards/card.ps.gz">result</a>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="slides">Slides</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you have to hurriedly hold a talk about &ldquo;What is the Debian Project?&rdquo;
do not worry. You can <a href="materials/slides/debian_mgp_slides.tar.gz">\
retrieve</a> the slides or <a href="materials/slides/">browse the source</a>
for ideas.  You can also take look at the <a href="talks">list of
talks</a> given by various people which cover Debian or some aspects
of the project.  Joey also set up a general <a
href="http://www.infodrom.org/Debian/events/talk-general.html">framework</a>
for a Debian related talk that you may want to base your talk upon.</p>

<p>There are also some nice background images available that you can
use to enhance your slides, for example this fancy
<a href="http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/debian_gel_logo/">Debian
Gel Logo</a> by Patrick McFarland. If you know of more suitable
images, <a href="mailto:events@debian.org">let us know</a>.
More Debian artwork is available <a href="$(HOME)/banners/">\
banners</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/logos/">logos</a> pages.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="tshirts">T-shirts</toc-add-entry>

<P>T-shirts are quite costly to do, but are quite good gifts for people
who help out in the booth or to the organization of the event (if they
are really that helpful). You can take a look at
<a href="materials/tshirts/">some graphics</a> used for t-shirts. If you're
planning to print t-shirts, you might like to contact
<a href="http://mdcc.cx/tshirt/">Joost van Baal</a>, who is willing to lend out
"films", i.e. transparent plastic slides used by t-shirt printers. That
will save you some money.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="cdroms">CD-ROMS</toc-add-entry>

<P>If you buy blank CDs in order to do a CDROM giveaway you might want
to spend a little more money and burn some CDs, do not forget and try
to make them look nicer than a blank CD-ROM disk (use artwork for this).
The main source for information for Debian CD-ROMs are the
<a href="$(HOME)/CD/">Debian CD pages</a> which detail the
process to download. They also include pretty nice
<a href="$(HOME)/CD/artwork/">artwork</a> to use as covers and labels.
Please take all required actions to stay in <a
href="$(HOME)/CD/vendors/legal">compliance</a> with the corresponding
license of the software.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="other">Other Sources</toc-add-entry>

<P>A good source of ideas and images for use in Debian merchandising
is <a href="http://gnuart.onshore.com/">http://gnuart.onshore.com/</a>.</p>

<P><Strong>Note:</Strong> Some of the sources (like flyers, pamphlets or slides)
may have become out of date since they were prepared. If you use them for a new
event be sure to check that the information is up-to-date and update them
if needed. If you do so, please submit the changes by sending a bug to
debian-www or by sending a mail to
<a href="mailto:events@debian.org">events@debian.org</a>.</p>
