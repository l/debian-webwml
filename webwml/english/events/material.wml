#use wml::debian::template title="Material and merchandising for Debian events" BARETITLE=true

<p>This page contains a list of all the different merchandising materials
 people organizing Debian booths can use (so they do not have to make them
 from scratch):</p> 

<h2>Posters</h2>

<p>Posters really dress up your booth pretty well, so you should take
some time and print a few. Also, if you take appropiate precautions,
they can be used from time to time in different events. If you do
not want to keep them you can always give them away in a 
BOF (Birds of a Feather) meeting.</p>
<p>You can find here also some <a href="materials/posters/">posters</A>.</p>

<P>For Germany, <a href="mailto:joey@debian.org">Joey</a> has a 
couple of posters he can send to you via yellow post.</p>

<h2>Flyers and Panflets</h2>
<p>People like to take things away from the booths, and even if you can
afford to give away more costly things (see below) you can always
provide flyers. Flyers have the ability to solve many questions
regarding to Debian, can entice people to contribute and for it's
paper they can take notes on it! All in all, they are pretty useful.</p>

<p>You can <a href="materials/flyers/debian_flyer.tar.gz">retrieve</a> the
full source used for building flyers, and you can  also
<a href="materials/flyers/">browse the files</a>. Currently, flyers are
available in English, German and Spanish. Translating to a new language is
as easy as translating the flyer.tex file and following the building
intructions in the <a href="materials/flyers/README">README file</a>.</p>

<p>For pamphlets, there are <a href="materials/pamphlets/">AbiWord files</A>
available for both English and Spanish that can be easily translated for
any other languages.</p>

<p>For Europe, Joey has bilingual (English and German) flyers made by <a
href="http://www.mixad.it/">Mixad</a> he can send around. Even if
your event takes place in a country of which none of the above are native
tongues, you might al<!-- .... ?!??  Uhm, what? TODO!! --></p>

<h2>Stickers</h2>
<p>One of the things people can appreciate most at a booth is the
give away of stickers. Debian stickers are quite handy because they
can be used to put your favorite OS image on laptops, monitors or
servers (Note: stickers with transparent background are quite cooler
than those with white background).</p>

<P>You can use both the <a href="/logos/">logos</A> (under the conditions
outlined) or any of the available <a href="materials/stickers/">stickers</a>.
In the subdirectory <a href="materials/stickers/pages/">pages</a> you will
find a the source for creating a page full of logos which can be useful to
print in a normal (color) printer with adhesive paper.</p>


<h2>Business cards for developers</h2>
<p>Since the people (developers or not) that dedicate quite some time 
to Debian do so out of their spare time (and effort) it is nice to prepare 
them a gift.  A Debian business card is a cool 
thing to do, and fills those people with proud that own one!
Also, people that are in charge of organising events 
and booths and get in touch with many other project leaders and 
coordinators in social events. <!-- I dont understand the previous sentence...
--> Giving out business cards with the Debian
logo contributes to Debians image and is useful to give out important
information that you usually have to scribble down on paper (email address, 
your GPG fingerprint...)</p>
<P>There is a <a href="materials/business-cards/">prototype</A> for 
business cards you can use. Customizing it is easy since you only have 
to edit the <tt>.tex</tt> file with the personal data and run
<tt>latex card.tex</tt>. Check out the
<a href="materials/business-cards/card.ps.gz">result</a>.</p>

<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>If you have to hurriedly hold a talk about ``What is the Debian Project?''
do not worry. You can <a href="materials/slides/debian_mgp_slides.tar.gz">\
retrieve</a> them or <a href="materials/slides/">browse the source</A>
for ideas. In any case, read the <a href="materials/slides/README">README
file</a>.</p>

<h2>Tshirts</h2>
<P>Tshirts are quite costly to do, but are quite good gifts for people
that help out in the booth or to the organisation of the event (if they
are really that helpful). You can take a look at
<a href="materials/tshirts/">some graphics</a> used for tshirts.</p>

<h2>CD-ROMS</h2>
<P>If you buy blank CDs in order to do a CDROM give away you might want
to spend a little more money and do also some CD artwork (covers and
labels) for them. Retrieve some <a href="materials/cdlabels/">sources and
ideas</A>.</p>

<h2>Other Sources</h2>
<P>A good source of ideas and images for use in Debian merchandising
is <a href="http://gnuart.onshore.com/">http://gnuart.onshore.com/</a>.</p>

# I'm not sure we should do this, should we? jfs
#<P>We have made a backup copy of the 
#<a href="gnuart.onshore.com-debian/">material</a>
#there which includes: banners, buttons, capsules and new versions of the
#openlogo.</p>

<P><Strong>Note:</Strong> Some of the sources (like flyers, pamphlets or slides)
might be out of date since they were prepared. If you use them for a new
event be sure to check that the information is uptodate and update them
if needed. If you do so, please submit the changes by sending a bug to
debian-www or by sending a mail to
<a href="mailto:events@debian.org">events@debian.org</a>.</p>
