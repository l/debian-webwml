Banner graphics specific for a particular distribution (i.e. woody,
sarge) should be placed in a directory named after that distribution.
They should be linked from the index.wml file in that particular
directory at least.  If they still refer to the current stable
distribution they should also be referenced in the banner index file.

General banner graphics should be placed in the banner directory
directly and referenced directly.

Warning: When a new distribution becomes stable and hence
<current_release> changes, the new directory will become visible via
the <otherdists> tag.  Hence, there should be an index.wml file in it.
