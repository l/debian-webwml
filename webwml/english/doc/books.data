  <publisher Freexian>

  <description
  <gettext domain="doc">Written by two Debian developers, this free book
  started as a translation of their French best-seller known as Cahier de
  l'admin Debian (published by Eyrolles). Accessible to all, this book
  teaches the essentials to anyone who wants to become an effective and
  independent Debian GNU/Linux administrator.  
  It covers all the topics that a competent Linux administrator should
  master, from the installation and the update of the system, up to the
  creation of packages and the compilation of the kernel, but also
  monitoring, backup and migration, without forgetting advanced topics
  like SELinux setup to secure services, automated installations, or
  virtualization with Xen, KVM or LXC.</gettext>>

  <description
  <gettext domain="doc">This book introduces the concepts and techniques of the Debian
  operating system, explaining their usage and pitfalls, and

  embrace the sophisticated and elegant, sometimes at first slightly
  non-intuitive solutions that have evolved as part of the Debian
  system over the past decade. While targeted at the well-versed
  UNIX/Linux administrator, the book can also serve as an excellent
  resource alongside a standard Linux reference to bootstrap one's
  Linux experience in Debian's bottom-up philosophy.</gettext>>
