  <gettext domain="doc">Written by two Debian developers, this free book
  started as a translation of their French best-seller known as Cahier de
  l'admin Debian (published by Eyrolles). Accessible to all, this book
  teaches the essentials to anyone who wants to become an effective and
  independent Debian GNU/Linux administrator.
  It covers all the topics that a competent Linux administrator should
  master, from the installation and the update of the system, up to the
  creation of packages and the compilation of the kernel, but also
  monitoring, backup and migration, without forgetting advanced topics
  like SELinux setup to secure services, automated installations, or
  virtualization with Xen, KVM or LXC.</gettext>>

  kernel patches, RAMdisks, ARM peculiarities and other ARM resources. It also
  includes extensive tutorial information on GNU/Linux basics for developers
  coming from other platforms.
  It is not specific to Debian, but the Aleph
  ARMLinux distribution is closely based on Debian-ARM and it is assumed you
  will be working from this distribution and preferably have a Debian based
  host machine too.</gettext>>
