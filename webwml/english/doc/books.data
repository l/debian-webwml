  Debian 8 is the must-have handbook for learning Linux. Start on the
  beginners level and learn how to deploy the system with graphical
  interface and terminal.
  This book provides the basic knowledge to grow and become a 'junior'
  systems administrator. Start off with exploring the GNOME desktop
  interface and adjust it to your personal needs. Overcome your fear of
  using the Linux terminal and learn the most essential commands in
  administering Debian. Expand your knowledge of system services (systemd)
  and learn how to adapt them. Get more out of the software in Debian and
  outside of Debian. Manage your home-network with network-manager, etc.
  10 percent of the profits on this book will be donated to the Debian
  Project.</gettext>>

  independent Debian GNU/Linux administrator.
  It covers all the topics that a competent Linux administrator should
  master, from the installation and the update of the system, up to the
  creation of packages and the compilation of the kernel, but also
  monitoring, backup and migration, without forgetting advanced topics
  like SELinux setup to secure services, automated installations, or
  virtualization with Xen, KVM or LXC.</gettext>>
