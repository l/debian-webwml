  <title The Debian System - Concepts and Techniques>
  <author Martin F. Krafft>
  <language english japanese german french>
  <URL "http://debiansystem.info/">
  <email info@debiansystem.info>
  <publisher "<a href="https://www.opensourcepress.de/">Open Source Press</a>">
  <cd-included official Debian GNU/Linux 3.1r0a "sarge" on DVD (i386)>
  <br>
  This book introduces the concepts and techniques of the Debian
  operating system, explaining their usage and pitfalls, and
  illustrating the thinking behind each of the approaches. The goal is
  not to be a reference book, but to give the reader enough insight
  into the workings of the project and operating system to learn and
  embrace the sophisticated and elegant, sometimes at first slightly
  non-intuitive solutions that have evolved as part of the Debian
  system over the past decade. While targeted at the well-versed
  UNIX/Linux administrator, the book can also serve as an excellent
  resource alongside a standard Linux reference to bootstrap one's
  Linux experience in Debian's bottom-up philosophy.
