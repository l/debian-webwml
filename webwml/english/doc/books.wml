# Greetings translators!
# As you may have noticed, we have changed the system for handling this
# list: from now translation of the blurb of books will be managed with
# gettext through the
# doc.XX.po file (where XX is the code of your language), located at
# webwml/$lang/po directory.
# You can add directly there the translation for the description of
# books, and they will be automagically included in the book list page.
# More information about the translation of PO strings of the website are
# available in the README file at webwml/english/po. For any doubt,
# please contact debian-www@lists.debian.org
