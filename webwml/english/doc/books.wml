# The title, author, language, url, available data fields should probably

# needs to be translated as does the intro when I get around to
# writing one and the instructions on how to add new books.
#
# Don't translate the attribute in the <language> tag of books.wml, just
# leave it as it is. It will be translated in your language automatically,
# assuming you've edited the slices in the language_names template.
