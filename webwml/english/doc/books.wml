  It is known as the most "open" of the Linux distributions -- for its
  commitment to the free software principles, and its community-centricism.
  It is also known for its tradition of high-quality packages and package
  management tools, as well as its focus on security issues.  Debian
  GNU/Linux Bible focuses on common apps, GUIs, networking, and system
  administration.

  <BR>
  This book is for developers working with GNU/Linux on ARM processors.
  It covers some devices specifically for quick set-up (LART, Assabet, Psion5).
  It also gives generic information, tools and techniques. The GNU
  toolchain is covered in native and cross-compiler form, as are bootloaders,
  kernel patches, RAMdisks, ARM peculiarities and other ARM resources. It also
  includes extensive tutorial information on GNU/Linux basics for developers
  coming from other platforms. It is not specific to Debian, but the Aleph
  ARMLinux distribution is closely based on Debian-ARM and it is assumed you
  will be working from this distribution and preferably have a Debian based
  host machine too.

  desktop at home, you're sure to find something of interest in this book.

  <title Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to Installation and Usage>
  <author John Goerzen and Ossama Othman>
  <language english>
  <publisher New Riders Publishing>
  <URL "http://www.newriders.com/">
  <email newriders@mcp.com>
  <cd-included one CD>
  <br>
  Debian isn't as intuitively obvious as some other operating systems, like
  Windows 95. GNU/Linux is like a race car, a master chef's kitchen, or a
  classic novel; its power and complexity make it difficult to approach at
  first, but far more rewarding in the long run. This book, in conjunction
  with the software, makes a reader comfortable with the concepts and
  confident enough to start using the operating system with proficiency. 
  <br>
  Released under the General Public License (GPL), Debian GNU/Linux: Guide to
  Installation and Usage contains the full Debian GNU/Linux distribution
  direct from the Debian Organization. This book was published with the
  support of the Debian organization and the Free Software Foundation (FSF). A
  portion of the proceeds from the book is being donated to the FSF.

  <title  Debian GNU/Linux - Grundlagen, Installation, Administration und Anwendung>
  <author Peter Ganten>

  <email ganten@uni-bremen.de>
  <cd-included 2 editions: One with no CD, the other with Official CD (i386, contrib and sources)>
  <br>
  The book covers all steps of planing and installing Debian GNU/Linux on 
  PC based hardware, including important applications like the X Window
  System, window-managers and desktop-environments (KDE, GNOME) and a great
  selection of important system services. UNIX/Linux basics and concepts together
  with system-usage and important components (bash, system-services and important
  commands) will be introduced.
  <br>
  There will be an explanation of Debian's package format and how to
  create packages in this format. Also an overview about standard Linux
  applications  (Networking, Software Development, LaTeX and Office Packages) will
  be given. Strong emphasis will be on networking and system administration
  issues, like the planing and building of a dial-in router or a server for
  windows based clients (SAMBA). Overall, the book will cover important Linux
  concepts to make it possible  -even for Linux beginners with low computer
  knowledge- to get started with Debian GNU/Linux. For experienced users and
  professionals the book will be of great help when setting up a system and
  solving new problems.
