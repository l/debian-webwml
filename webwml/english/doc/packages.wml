#use wml::debian::ddp title="Debian Packages for our Documents"

<p>I suggest the following Debian packages:

<p><table>
<tr><th>Debian Package<th>Documents
<tr valign=top><td>debian-doc
<td>META Manual, Hardware Compatibility List,
Installation Manual, Release Notes, 
FAQ, Debian Tips, User's Manual,
Debian System Administrators Manual,
<tr valign=top><td>debian-policy
<td>Policy Manual
<tr valign=top><td>debian-doc-dev
<td>Project Manual, Developers Reference Manual,
Programmer's Manual, Making a Debian Package, Packaging HOWTO,
Documentation Guidelines, How to get started with SGML
<tr valign=top><td>dpkg-dev
<td>dpkg Reference Manual,
dpkg Internals
</table><p>
Note that I suggest renaming <strong>doc-debian</strong> into
<strong>debian-doc</strong> since I find the latter name much better.
