<p>The Debian Documentation Project stores its web pages and much of the
manual text on the Debian Subversion server at <strong>svn.debian.org</strong>.
svn.debian.org is part of the Gforge installation on alioth.debian.org.
Please read the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Alioth">Alioth documentation</a>
for more information about how this service works.
</p>

<p>Everybody can download the sources from the SVN server. Only members of
the Debian Documentation Project can update files.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="access">Accessing the sources in SVN</toc-add-entry>
  
<p>You can use a web interface to access the files individually and
see changes to them at <url "http://svn.debian.org/wsvn/ddp/manuals/trunk" /></p>

<p>For downloading an entire manual, direct access to the SVN server
is often a better option. You need the
<tt><a href="http://packages.debian.org/subversion">subversion</a></tt> package on your
own machine.</p>

<h3>Connecting anonymously (read-only) to the SVN server</h3>

<p>Use this command to download all the files:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>svn co svn://svn.debian.org/ddp/manuals/trunk manuals</code>
</p>

<p>This will recursively create the directories and populate them.</p>

<p>To update your local copy with any changes made by other people, enter
the <strong>manuals</strong> directory and run the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>svn update</code>
</p>

<h3>Connecting to the SVN server, with update privileges (svn)</h3>

<p>Before accessing the SVN server using this method you have to be
granted write access to it first.  Please read how to <a
href="#obtaining">request</a> update permission first.</p>

<p>Use this command to download all the files:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>svn co svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals/trunk manuals</code>
</p>

<p>This will recursively create the directories and populate them.</p>

<p>To update your local copy with any changes made by other people, enter
the <strong>manuals</strong> directory and run the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>svn update</code>
</p>

<h3>Connecting to the SVN server, with update privileges (git-svn)</h3>

<p>Before accessing the SVN server using this method you have to be
granted write access to it first.  Please read how to <a
href="#obtaining">request</a> update permission first.</p>

<p>Use this command to download all the files:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>git svn clone -s -rHEAD svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/ddp/manuals manuals</code>
</p>

<p>This will recursively create the directories and populate them and also create 
a local git repository without older history which can track alioth SVN server.</p>

<p>To update your local copy with any changes made by other people, enter
the <strong>manuals</strong> directory and run the command:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em">
  <code>git svn rebase</code>
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="obtaining">Obtaining update privileges</toc-add-entry>

<p>Update privileges are available to anyone who wishes to participate in
writing the manuals.  We generally request that you have submitted
a couple of useful patches first.</p>

<p>To obtain update privileges, you need to send a request to the 
<a href="mailto:debian-doc@lists.debian.org">Debian documentation
mailing list</a>. Please explain why you need access. Please indicate
your <a href="http://alioth.debian.org">Alioth</a> login name.
Once your request is approved, you'll be part of the <a
href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/ddp"><q>ddp</q> project</a> (and
Unix group) on Alioth.</p>

<p>The published web pages of the manual text are generated on
www-master.debian.org as part of the regular web site rebuilding process,
which happens every four hours.</p>

<p>The script does a <kbd>svn update</kbd>, and then
<kbd>make -C manuals clean publish</kbd>.</p>

<p>The makefile is set up to rebuild each subdirectory (that contains
maintained documentation), and to install the files from each subdirectory
in <code>doc/manuals/</code> subdirectory of the web site. The subdirectory
makefiles are derived from <code>manuals/standard.makefile</code>.</p>

<p>The documentation files generated by the update script can be found at
<a href="manuals/">http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/</a>.</p>

<p>The log files generated by the update script can be found at
<url "http://www-master.debian.org/build-logs/ddp/" /></p>

<p>Note that this process regenerates the <code>/doc/manuals/</code>
directory. The contents of the <code>/doc/</code> directory is generated
either from <a href="/devel/website/desc">webwml</a> or from other scripts,
such as those which extract certain manuals from their packages.</p>
