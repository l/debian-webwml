#use wml::debian::ddp title="DDP Documentation Policy"

<p>
This manual is quite outdated and there is an effort to fix it in
<email debian-doc@lists.debian.org>.

<p>Here is a list of decisions that were made on our mailing list and
approved by our Documentation Manager, Susan G. Kleinmann.

<br>&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>All manuals of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP) will be
  released under DFSG-compliant licenses, most likely GPL.
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li>We'll use the following directory structure:

  <p>Filesystem:
<pre>
  /usr/share/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>/index.html
  /usr/share/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.ps.gz (optional)
</pre>

  <p>WWW server:
<pre>
  http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>/
</pre>

  <p>FTP server:
<pre>
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.html.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.text.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.dvi.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.ps.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/<var>somemanual</var>.sgml.tar.gz
</pre>

  <p>Please note that this part of the policy hasn't been universally
  accepted yet, so those URIs may not work. The real locations of
  documents may vary for backwards compatibility.

  <br>&nbsp;

  <li>We'll use SGML as source format.

  <p>Note that this does not mean that users have to learn SGML to submit
  changes to our documents. We accept all other formats as well. However,
  they will be translated into SGML by one of the Debian-Doc people.

  <p><small>The other options were: LaTeX, HTML, Texinfo, and several other
  minor formats.</small>
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li>We'll use <strong>debiandoc-sgml</strong> for our documents.

  <p><small>The other options were linuxdoc-sgml or DocBook.  Linuxdoc is
  no longer maintained; DocBook is judged by many to be too big and complex
  and difficult to customize.</small>
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li>Every Debian document will have a single person listed as
  <em>Maintainer</em> and might also have additional people listed as
  <em>Co-Maintainers</em>.

</ul>
