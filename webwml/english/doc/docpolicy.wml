#use wml::debian::ddp title="DDP Documentation Policy"

<p>Here is a list of decisions that were made on our mailing list and
approved by our Documentation Manager, Susan G. Kleinmann.

<p><ul>
  <li>All manuals of the Debian Documentation Project (DDP) will be
  released under DFSG-compliant licenses, most likely GPL.

  <li>We'll use the following directory structure in the filesystem and
  on our servers:
<pre>

 Filesystem:
  /usr/doc/manuals/debian-policy/index.html
  /usr/doc/manuals/debian-policy.ps.gz (optional)

 WWW server:
  http://www.debian.org/manuals/debian-policy/index.html

 FTP server:
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/debian-policy.html.tar.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/debian-policy.text.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/debian-policy.dvi.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/debian-policy.ps.gz
  ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/manuals/debian-policy.sgml.tar.gz

</pre>

  <li>We'll use SGML as source format.

  <p>The other options were: LaTeX, HTML, texinfo, and several other minor
  formats.

  <p>Note that this does not mean that users have to learn SGML to submit
  changes to our documents. We accept all other formats as well. However,
  they will be translated into SGML by one of the Debian DOC people.<p>

  <li>We'll use <strong>debiandoc-sgml</strong> for our documents.

  <p>The other options were linuxdoc-sgml or DocBook.  Linuxdoc is no longer
  maintained; DocBook is judged by many to be too big and complex and
  difficult to customize.

  <li>Every Debian document will have a single person listed as
  <em>Maintainer</em> and might also have additional people listed as
  <em>Co-Maintainers</em>.
</ul>
