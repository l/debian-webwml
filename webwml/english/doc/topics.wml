#use wml::debian::ddp title="Debian Documentation Project (DDP) Current Topics"

<p>The following issues are under immediate or pressing need for
consideration, discussion, or helpful volunteers.

<br>&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li><strong>DDP and www.debian.org integration</strong>
  <p>Jay Treacy has opened a topic on standardizing file locations for
  packages, for the web site, and probably within the DDP.  See
  <a href="todo">Todo</a> for more information.
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li><strong>LDP cooperation</strong>
  <p>We need to be more integrated with the LDP project, since we can't do
  it alone. Some have stepped forward to package some of the LDP
  documents.
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li><strong>Making <tt>debiandoc-sgml</tt> safe for Internationalization</strong>
  <p>It's not entirely clear yet what has to be done for debiandoc-sgml to
  be multi-lingual friendly.  Some have started working on a basic
  grove-based SGML structure extractor, which helps keep structural
  similarity between different translations of one document.  We know
  that file output naming might need to be changed or post-processed for
  documents in content-negotiated web spaces.  Other problems need to be
  identified.
  <br>&nbsp;

  <li><strong>Issues on packaging documentation.</strong>
  <p>The question is how document correlate into packages.  Having one
  package per document has the following advantages:
  <ul>
    <li>Packages will be small. If a single document is updated, one does
    not have to download all documents.
    <li>Things are clearer if the package maintainer is the document
    maintainer (i.e., author).
    <li>One can easily report bugs against documents.
  </ul>
  but also the following disadvantages:
  <ul>
    <li>We already have enough packages and some users already complain that
    there are too many.
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a proposal (which is probably a little obsolete).  Current
  thinking is that manuals should reside in their own packages, unless the
  manuals are very small.  The accountability given by the BTS and the
  ability to ship new versions without fuss seem to outweigh the minor point
  of reducing packages.

  <p>I suggest the following Debian packages:

  <table>
   <tr>
    <th>Debian Package</th>
    <th>Documents</th>
   </tr>
   <tr valign=top>
    <td>debian-doc</td>
    <td>META Manual, Hardware Compatibility List,
        Installation Manual, Release Notes, 
        FAQ, Debian Tips, User's Manual,
        Debian System Administrators Manual</td>
   </tr>
   <tr valign=top>
    <td>debian-policy</td>
    <td>Policy Manual</td>
   </tr>
   <tr valign=top>
    <td>debian-doc-dev</td>
    <td>Project Manual, Developers Reference Manual,
        Programmer's Manual, Making a Debian Package, Packaging HOWTO,
        Documentation Guidelines, How to get started with SGML</td>
   </tr>
   <tr valign=top>
    <td>dpkg-dev</td>
    <td>dpkg Reference Manual, dpkg Internals</td>
   </tr>
  </table>
  
  <p>Note that I suggest renaming <strong>doc-debian</strong> into
  <strong>debian-doc</strong> since I find the latter name much better.

  <p>Do we need any sort of policy statement about this issue?
</ul>
