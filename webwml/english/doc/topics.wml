#use wml::debian::ddp title="DDP Current Topics"

<p>The following issues are under immediate or pressing need for
consideration, discussion, or helpful volunteers.

<p>
<ul>
  <p><li><strong>DDP and www.debian.org integration</strong>
  <p>Jay Treacy has opened a topic on standardizing file locations for
  packages, for the web site, and probably within the DTD.  See
  <a href="todo">Todo</a> for more information.

  <p><li><strong>LDP cooperation</strong>
  <p>We need to be more integrated with the LDP project, since we can't do
  it alone. Some have stepped forward to package some of the LDP
  documents.

  <p><li><strong>Making <tt>debiandoc-sgml</tt> safe for Internationalization</strong>
  <p>It's not entirely clear yet what has to be done for debiandoc-sgml to
  be multi-lingual friendly.  Some have started working on a basic
  grove-based SGML structure extrator, which helps keep structural
  similarity between different translations of one document.  We know
  that file output naming might need to be changed or post-processed for
  documents in content-negotiated web spaces.  Other problems need to be
  identified.

  <p><li><strong>Issues on packaging documentation.</strong>
  <p>The question is how document correlate into packages.  Having one
  package per document has the following advantages:
  <ul>
    <li>Packages will be small. If a single document is updated, one does
    not have to download all documents.
    <li>Things are clearer if the package maintainer is the document
    maintainer (i.e., author).
    <li>One can easily report bugs against documents.
  </ul>
  but also the following disadvantages:
  <ul>
    <li>We already have enough packages and some users already complain that
    there are too many.
  </ul>

  <p>Here is a <a href="packages">proposal</a> (which is probably a
  little obsolete).  Current thinking is that manuals should reside in
  their own packages, unless the manuals are very small.  The
  accountability given by the BTS and the ability to ship new versions
  without fuss seem to outweigh the minor point of reducing packages.

  <p>Do we need any sort of policy statement about this issue?
</ul>
