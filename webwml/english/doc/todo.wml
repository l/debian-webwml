#use wml::debian::ddp title="DDP TODO List"

<H3>Urgent TO-DO list:</H3>

<ul>
  <li>Ruthless stale documentation reaping.

  <li>Stipulate and document a documentation hierarchy.  Basically, complete
  the <a href="docpolicy">Documentation Policy</a> document, with the assent
  and blessing of the Debian Web team.  This involves consistency of file
  location in the web area and in packages. There is a draft available
  <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/ddp-policy/ch-manuals.en.html#s3.5">
  here</A> but needs to be revised yet.

  <li>Add a way to manage translations automatically just as the website's
  WML sources are.

  <li>Determine which information should be included in the CD and 
  <em>automate</em> a method to create the proper index.
  Relevant information is <a href="http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/ddp-policy/ch-manuals.en.html#s3.6">here</A>
  and the CVS holds some 
  <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/ddp/utils/scripts/?cvsroot=debian-doc">scripts</a>
  that need to be polished and added to a cron job.
</ul>

<H3>Ideas:</H3>

<p>The following is just a list of ideas that came up in several threads
on our mailing list. Thus, these may be good and bad ideas. :-)

<br>&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Implement URN's.  This would enable users to check for documentation
  locally, on the web site, or on mirrors.  Local configuration could be
  used to indicate closer or more convenient mirrors or ordering.
  <tt>doc-base</tt> could use URNs to point to documents rather than
  using file names.

  <li>I thought about what output formats we want to include in the debian
  packages (.deb's). We need to include HTML (that's the policy) but
  some people may also want to have PostScript or TEXT versions. So I
  had the idea of distributing the SGML source _only_ and creating the
  formats the user wants to have at runtime (could be installation time
  as well as afterwards). This has several advantages:
    <ul>
      <li>the .debs would be small
      <li>greatest flexibility
      <li>we could even adjust links when compiling the docs, i.e. replacing
          Internet links to local ones if the files are present !!!
      <li>it's probably easier to keep an overall index page up-to-date (a la
          dwww)
    </ul>
  The disadvantages I see:
    <ul>
      <li>people need to have debiandoc-sgml installed (but that's not big)
      <li>formatting will take a few seconds (not too much but simply unpackaging
          would be faster)
    </ul>
  <p><tt>doc-base</tt> could define the fundamentals of this type of
  system, since it tracks metadata for documents.
</ul>
