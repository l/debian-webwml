<H2>Frequently Asked Questions</H2>

If you have a question that you can't figure out on your own, it is most
likely that others had the same question in the past.  The answers of
frequently asked questions are kept in so-called FAQs and guess what: there
is one specially for Debian and another one for Linux in general.

<H2>Debian also has a user run FAQ</H2>
In addition to the traditional FAQ,
Debian has set up a <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/cgi-bin/fom">FAQOMATIC</A>.
It is a FAQ, where users can submit and answer
questions. With a large number of people helping to keep this current
(the entire Debian user base), this is becoming an invaluable resource.
Please check it before asking questions on debian-user.

<P>We are still looking for people to help administer this. If interested,
please contact Igor Grobman &lt;<A HREF="mailto:igor@debian.org">igor@debian.org</A>&gt;.

HOWTO</A>.

<HR>
<H2>Debian User's Manual</H2>

*This is a work on progress *<BR>
Work is under way to create a
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/~hp/debian-tutorial.html">user tutorial</A>
for Debian. It is incomplete, but should still be useful.

<HR>
<H2>The Debian Documentation Project</H2>

The Debian Documentation Project was formed to coordinate the effort
of several Debian developers to write more and better documentation
for the Debian system. If you are interested, you can have a look at
the <a href="http://www.debian.org/~elphick/ddp/">DDP home page</a>.
