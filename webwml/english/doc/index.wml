#use wml::debian::template title="User Documentation"

<P>An important part of any operating system is documentation, as there is
no way to make use of something you can't operate. Debian is making every
effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation, in an easily
accessible form.

<P>The <A HREF="ddp">Debian Documentation Project</A> pages contain
general information about the status of most Debian-related documentation
in our distribution, and links to most of the documents.

<H2>Finding answers</H2>

<P>Information on installing Debian GNU/Linux can be found on the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/#new-inst">stable release</a> page. Before
installation, you should check the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html">Linux Hardware
Compatibility HOWTO</A>.

<P>There are two user-oriented manuals for Debian GNU/Linux, the
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/~hp/debian-tutorial.html">Debian Tutorial</A> and
the <A HREF="http://www.newriders.com/debian/html/noframes/">Debian Guide</A>.

<P>If you have a question that you can't figure out on your own, it is most
likely that others had the same question in the past.  The answers of
frequently asked questions are kept in so-called FAQs.

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ/index.html">Linux
FAQ</A> contains information regarding Linux in general. Questions
specifically related to Debian are answered in the <A HREF="FAQ/">Debian
GNU/Linux FAQ</A>.

<P>In addition to the traditional FAQ, Debian has set up a
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/cgi-bin/fom">Faq-O-Matic</A>, a FAQ where
users can submit and answer questions. It is becoming an invaluable resource,
as the large number of people, Debian developers and users, are helping to
keep this current.

<H2><A HREF="http://www.linux.org/help/howto.html">Linux HOWTO's</A></H2>

<P>As there are so many configurations possible for the setup and
maintenance of a Linux systems, knowledgeable people have provided
comprehensive instructions on how to do many specific tasks. For good reason
they are called HOWTOs. If you need your Debian system to do something that
isn't covered by the normal Debian setup, this is a good resource to check.

<P>The HOWTO's are actually part of the Linux Documentation Project. They
are also available for installation on your machine in the doc-linux-text
package.

<H2><A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A></H2>

<P>Linux documentation is coordinated through the efforts of the
<A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">Linux Documentation Project</A>.
The overall goal of the LDP is to collaborate in taking care of all of
the issues of Linux documentation, ranging from online docs (man
pages, texinfo docs, and so on) to printed manuals covering topics
such as installing, using, and running Linux. For more information about
LDP, please visit their <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">web pages</A>.

<P>The LDP has so far produced a number of Linux documents and manuals, and
some of the most popular ones are:

<UL>
  <LI>The <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/LDP/gs/gs.html">Linux
      Installation and Getting Started</a>, by Matt Welsh and others.
