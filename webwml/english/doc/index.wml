#use wml::debian::template title="User Documentation"

<P>An important part of any operating system is documentation, as there is
no way to make use of something you can't operate. Debian is making every
effort to provide all of its users with proper documentation, in an easily
accessible form.

<P>Information on installing Debian GNU/Linux can be found on the
<a href="../releases/stable/#new-inst">stable release</a> page. Before
installation, you should check the
<A HREF="http://metalab.unc.edu/mdw/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO.html">Linux Hardware
Compatibility HOWTO</A>.

<P>There are two user-oriented manuals for Debian GNU/Linux, the
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/~hp/debian-tutorial.html">Debian Tutorial</A> and
the <A HREF="http://www.newriders.com/debian/html/noframes/">Debian Guide</A>.

<HR>

<P>If you have a question that you can't figure out on your own, it is most
likely that others had the same question in the past.  The answers of
frequently asked questions are kept in so-called FAQs.

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.linuxdoc.org/FAQ/Linux-FAQ/index.html">Linux
FAQ</A> contains information regarding Linux in general. Questions
specifically related to Debian are answered in the <A HREF="FAQ/">Debian
GNU/Linux FAQ</A>.

<P>In addition to the traditional FAQ, Debian has set up a
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/cgi-bin/fom">Faq-O-Matic</A>, a FAQ where
users can submit and answer questions. It is becoming an invaluable resource,
as the large number of people, Debian developers and users, are helping to
keep this current. Please check it before asking questions on the debian-user
mailing list.

<HR>

<P>The <A HREF="ddp">Debian Documentation Project</A> pages contain
general information about the status of most Debian-related documentation
in our distribution, and links to most of the documents.
