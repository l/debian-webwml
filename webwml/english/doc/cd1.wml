#   This file is used to generate index files for
#       ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/
#   Links are only right when these pages are put together
#   in debian-cd, so do not try to fix them, this would be
#   a very bad idea!


<h2><a href="../install/doc/index.en.html">Manuals</a></h2>
#   Translators:  these manuals are installed on CDs by the
#   boot-floppies package; they are installed under /install/doc/,
#   and other languages differ from English, translated index files
#   are available at <a href="../install/doc/xx/index.xx.html">

<p>Please read these before you begin, especially if you are new to
Linux.  These manuals are designed to get you started quickly by
explaining things you could not possibly already know without previous
experience with Linux and with the Debian GNU/Linux distribution.  It
will save you hours of frustration if you begin here and patiently read
the fine manual from cover to cover.</p>

<h2><a href="en/html/faq/">FAQ</a></h2>
#   Translators:  this link is not processed, put a link either to
#   your translation or to english document

<p>There are quite many questions that people that do not know what is
really Debian ask themselves once in a while. The FAQ of Debian tries to
answer all these. Even if manuals or other documentation will take an
in-depth look to many of these issues, you might find it worthwhile
reading it.</p>
