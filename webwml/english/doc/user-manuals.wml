<document "Securing Debian Manual" "securing">

<div class="centerblock">
<p>
  This manual describes the security of the Debian GNU/Linux 
  operating system and within the Debian project. It starts
  with the process of securing and hardening the default Debian GNU/Linux
  installation (both manually and automatically), covers some of the 
  common tasks involved in setting up a secure user and network environment,
  gives information on the security tools available, steps to take
  before and after a compromise and also describes how security is
  enforced in Debian by the security team. The document includes
  a step by step hardening guide and within the appendix there
  is detailed information on how to setup an intrusion detection
  system and a bridge firewall with Debian GNU/Linux.
