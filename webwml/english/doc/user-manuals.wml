<document "Debian User Reference Manual" "userref">

<blockquote>
  This manual provides at least an overview of everything a user should know
  about his Debian GNU/Linux system (i.e. setting up X, how to configure
  network, accessing floppy disks, etc.). It is intended to bridge the gap
  between the Debian Tutorial and the detailed manual and info pages
  supplied with each package.

  <p>It is also intended to give some idea of how to combine commands, on
  the general Unix principle, that <em>there is always more than one way to
  do it</em>.

<document "Debian Tips" "tips">

<blockquote>
  "I'd really like to see a Debian tips package (documentation only).  It
  would include stuff that people had figured out and would like to share. 
  Maybe we could even put some scripts into it.  We could also have a
  debian-tips mailing-list to make it easy for people to suggest new tips."

#  <p>Here are a few example tips:
#  <ul>
#    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/~elphick/ddp/tips/less.txt">setting up less as a default pager</a>
#    <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/~elphick/ddp/tips/exmh.txt">getting the picons database to work with exmh</a>
