This manual is for a new Linux user, to help such a user get acquainted

<h2><a name="userref">Debian User Reference Manual</a></h2>
<blockquote>
This manual provides at least an overview of everything a user should know about his Debian
GNU/Linux system (i.e. setting up X, how to configure network, accessing
floppy disks, etc.). It is intended to bridge the gap between the Debian
Tutorial and the detailed manual and info pages supplied with each package.
<p>
It is also intended to give some idea of how to combine commands, on the
general Unix principle, that <em>there is always more than one way to do it</em>.

<h2><a name="tips">Debian Tips</a></h2>
<blockquote>
Jim Pick: I'd really like to see a Debian tips package (documentation only).  It would
include stuff that people had figured out and would like to share.  Maybe we
could even put some scripts into it.  We could also have a debian-tips
mailing-list to make it easy for people to suggest new tips.
<p>
Here are a few example tips:
<ul>
<li><a href="tips/less.txt">setting up less as a default pager</a>
<li><a href="tips/exmh.txt">getting the picons database to work with exmh</a>
</ul>
