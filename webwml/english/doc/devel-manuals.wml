<document "Debian Policy Manual" "policy">

<blockquote>
  This manual describes the policy requirements for the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution. This includes the structure and contents of the Debian
  archive, several design issues of the operating system, as well as
  technical requirements that each package must satisfy to be included
  in the distribution.

<document "Debian Packaging Manual" "packman">

<blockquote>
  This manual describes the technical aspects of creating Debian binary
  and source packages. It also documents the interface between dselect
  and its access method scripts. It does not deal with the Debian
  Project policy requirements, and it assumes familiarity with dpkg's
  functions from the system administrator's perspective.

  <authors "Ian Jackson, Klee Dienes, David A. Morris, Christian Schwarz">
  <status>
  Parts that were de facto policy were recently merged into debian-policy;
  the rest is planned to be included in a new `dpkg packaging manual', to
  be written by Wichert Akkerman.

<document "Debian Developer's Reference" "devref">

<blockquote>
  This manual describes procedures and resources for Debian maintainers.
  It describes how to become a new developer, the upload procedure, how
  to handle our bug tracking system, the mailing lists, Internet
  servers, etc.

  <p>This manual is thought as a <em>reference manual</em> for all Debian
  developers (newbies and old pros).

<document "Debian New Maintainers' Guide" "maint-guide">

<blockquote>
  This document will try to describe building of a Debian GNU/Linux package
  to the common Debian user (and wannabe developer) in common language, and
  well covered with working examples.

  <p>Unlike previous attempts, this one is based on <code>debhelper</code>
  and the new tools available to maintainers.  The author is making every
  attempt to incorporate and unify previous efforts.

<document "Debian Menu System" "menu">

<blockquote>
  This manual describes the Debian Menu System and the <strong>menu</strong>
  package.

  <p>The menu package was inspired by the install-fvwm2-menu program from
  the old fvwm2 package. However, menu tries to provide a more general
  interface for menu building. With the update-menus command from this
  package, no package needs to be modified for every X window manager again,
  and it provides a unified interface for both text- and X-oriented
  programs.

<document "Introduction to i18n" "i18n">

<blockquote>
  This document describes basic idea and howto of l10n (localization),
  i18n (internationalization), and m17n (multilingualization) for
  programmers and package maintainers.

  <p>The aim of this document is to make more packages support i18n
  and to make Debian a more internationalized distribution.
  Contributions from all over the world will be welcome, because
  the original author is Japanese-speaker and this document would be
  on Japanization if there were no contributions.
