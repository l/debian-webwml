        <dt><strong><a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/">Debian Policy Manual</a></strong></dt>
        <dd>
        This manual describes the policy requirements for the Debian GNU/Linux
        distribution. This includes the structure and contents of the Debian
        archive, several design issues of the operating system, as well as
        technical requirements that each package must satisfy to be included in
        the distribution.

        <p>In short, you <strong>need</strong> to read it.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>There are several documents related to the Policy that you might be
      interested in, such as:
      <ul type=disc>
        <li><a href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a> (FHS)
        <br>The FHS is a list of directories (or files) where things have
            to be put, and compatibility with it is required by Policy
            3.x.
        <li>List of <a href="$(DOC)/packaging-manuals/build-essential">build-essential packages</a>
        <br>The build-essential packages are packages you are expected to
            have before you try to build any package, or a set of packages
            that you don't have to include in your package's
            <code>Build-Depends</code> line.
        <li><a href="$(DOC)/packaging-manuals/menu.html/">Menu system</a>
        <br>Programs that have an interface that need not be passed any
            special command line arguments for normal operation should
            have a menu entry registered.
        <li><a href="$(DOC)/packaging-manuals/debian-emacs-policy">Emacs policy</a>
        <br>The packages related to Emacs are expected to abide by their
            own sub-policy document.
        <li><a href="http://people.debian.org/~opal/java/policy.html">Java policy</a>
        <br>The proposed equivalent for the above, for Java-related packages.
        <li><a href="http://people.debian.org/~bod/perl-policy/">Perl policy</a>
        <br>A sub-policy that covers everything regarding Perl packaging.
      </ul>

      <p>Take a look at <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/debian-policy">
      proposed updates to Policy</a>, too.

      <p>Note that the old Packaging Manual has mostly been integrated into
      the recent versions of the Policy Manual.

        language, and is well covered with working examples. If you are a
        wannabe developer (packager), you will most definitely want to read
        this.
