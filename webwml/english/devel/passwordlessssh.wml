#use wml::debian::template title="How to set up ssh so you aren't asked for a password" BARETITLE=true

<p>You can create a RSA authentication key to be able to log into a remote
site from your account, without having to type your password.

<p>Note that once you've set this up, if an intruder breaks into your
account/site, they are given access to the site you are mirroring, too!
For this reason, this should <strong>never</strong> be done from root.

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>ssh-keygen</code> on your machine, and just hit enter when
      asked for a password.
  <li>Next, add the contents of <code>~/.ssh/identity.pub</code> from your
      machine to <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the mirror site (the
      file should be mode 600). If you are using the version 2 of the ssh
      protocol, that will be <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code> and
      <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys2</code>, respectively.
</ul>

<p>You should then be able to use ssh to log in to the remote server
without being asked for a password.
