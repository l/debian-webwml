<p>You can create a RSA authentication key to be able to log into a remote
site from your account, without having to type your password.

<p>Note that once you've set this up, if an intruder breaks into your
account/site, they are given access to the site you are allowed in without a
password, too!
For this reason, this should <strong>never</strong> be done from root.

<ul>
  <li>Run <code>ssh-keygen</code> on your machine, and just hit enter when
      asked for a password.
      <br>
      With older SSH versions, this will generate
      <code>~/.ssh/identity.pub</code>; with newer ones, it will generate
      <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>.
  <li>Next, add the contents of the aforementioned file into
      <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> on the remote site (the file
      should be mode 600).
      <br>
      If you are a developer and you want to access debian.org systems with
      such a key, it's possible to have the developer database propagate
      your key to all of the debian.org machines. See the
      <a href="http://db.debian.org/doc-mail.html">LDAP gateway
      documentation</a>.
</ul>

<p>You should then be able to use ssh to log in to the remote server
without being asked for a password.
