<H1>How You Can Help?</H1>

<P>Debian is produced entirely by volunteers.
We are generally looking for new developers who have some
technical knowledge, an interest in free software and some free time.
If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<A HREF="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</A>
in our
<A HREF="../social_contract">Social Contract</A>.

<P>Next, you should
<A HREF="../support#mail_lists">subscribe</A> to the debian-devel mailing list
for a while and look at the <A HREF="../doc/prospective-packages.html">Work-Needing
and Prospective Packages</A> document to see what packages need developers.
Taking over someone else's package is the best way to start out as a developer
as you can learn from what the previous maintainer has already done.
Finally, if you see an area that you can help out, read the
<A HREF="../doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Developers-Reference</A> for
instructions on how to join Debian.

<P>Besides the many developers, Debian also needs
<A HREF="../donations">donations</A> of money and use of machines for
development and connectivity. We are still looking for
<A HREF="mirror">mirrors</A> in some parts of the world.

<P>Even if you don't have time to maintain packages or aren't in a
position to make monetary or equipment donations to Debian you can
still help out by filing
<A HREF="../Bugs/">bug reports</A> against packages that have errors in them.
To make it easier to file bugs, there is even a
<A HREF="../Packages/stable/utils/bug.html">bug program</A>
to make filing reports easy.

<HR>
<P>Back to the <A HREF="../">Debian GNU/Linux homepage</A>.
