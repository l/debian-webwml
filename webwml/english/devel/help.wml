<P>Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed
entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new developers who
have some technical knowledge, an interest in free software, and some free
time. If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<A HREF="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</A>
in our
<A HREF="../social_contract">Social Contract</A>.

<P>You need to <A HREF="../support#mail_lists">subscribe</A> to the
debian-devel-announce mailing list, preferrably also debian-devel and
debian-news (and any others you may be interested in), and read them for
a while, so you get a general feeling of who we are and what we do.
Look at the <A HREF="../doc/prospective-packages.html">Work-Needing and
Prospective Packages</A> list to see what packages need maintainers. Taking
over someone else's package is the best way to start out as a developer as
you can learn from what the previous maintainer has already done.

<P>Finally, if you see an area that you can help out, read the
<A HREF="../doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Developer's
Reference</A> for instructions on how to join Debian. If you're still
in the queue for becoming an official developer, check out our
<A HREF="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/">sponsorship
program</a>.

<P>Besides the many developers, Debian also needs
<A HREF="../donations">donations</A> of money and use of machines for
development and connectivity. We are still looking for
<A HREF="mirror">mirrors</A> in some parts of the world.

<P>Even if you don't have time to maintain packages or aren't in a
position to make monetary or equipment donations to Debian, you can
still help out by filing <A HREF="../Bugs/">bug reports</A> against
packages that have errors in them.
To make it easier to file bugs, we have made programs such as 
<A HREF="../Packages/unstable/utils/bug.html">bug</A> and
<A HREF="../Packages/unstable/utils/reportbug.html">reportbug</A>
which make filing bug reports very easy.
