#use wml::debian::template title="Advocating a prospective developer"

<p>Before advocating a prospective developer, you should check that they
satisfy all things listed on the <a href="./nm-checklist">NM checklist</a>.
</p>

<p>You should <em>only</em> advocate someone if you think that they are
ready to be a developer. This means that you should have known them for
some time and can judge their work. It is important that prospective
developers have been working in the project for some time, by maintaining
a package, helping users and sending patches. They should be familiar
with Debian's special ways of doing things and have contributed some
work to the project. Just ask yourself if you want to see them in Debian
&ndash; if you think they should be a Debian developer then go ahead and 
recommend them.
</p>

<p>Next carry out the following steps: Agree with the prospective developer
to recommend them and let them <a href="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">sign
up</a>. After that, you have to click on their name in the <a
href="http://nm.debian.org/nmlist.php">listing of Applicants</a>
and go the "Advocate this application" page. Enter your debian login
and press the "Advocate" button. You then will receive an e-mail with an
auth key which you have to return PGP/GPG signed. After this, the 
Applicant is added to the queue for an Application Manager with whom
he will go through all steps of the New Maintainer checks.
