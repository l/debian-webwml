#use wml::debian::template title="Advocating a prospective member"

<p>Before advocating a prospective member, you should check that they
satisfy all things listed on the <a href="./nm-checklist">NM checklist</a>.
</p>

<p>You should <em>only</em> advocate someone if you think that they are
ready to be a project member. This means that you should have known them for
some time and can judge their work. It is important that prospective
members have been working in the project for some time.  Some ways
prospective members might be contributing include:</p>

<ul>
<li>maintaining a package (or several),</li>
<li>helping users,</li>
<li>publicity work,</li>
<li>translations,</li>
<li>organizing work for debconf,</li>
<li>sending patches,</li>
<li>contributing bug reports,</li>
<li>... and much more!</li>
</ul>

<p>These ways of helping are not mutually exclusive, of course!  Many
prospective members will have done work in several areas of the
project, and not everyone must be a packager.  Remember, <a
href="https://www.debian.org/vote/2010/vote_002">Debian welcomes
non-packaging contributors as project members</a>.  For a wider
overview of a given contributor, you may be interested in <a
href="http://ddportfolio.debian.net/">tools which aggregate some
publicly-visible parts of the project</a>.  Your personal knowledge of
the applicant is also important here.
</p>

<p>The prospective member should be familiar with Debian's special
ways of doing things and should have already contributed actively and
effectively to the project.  Most importantly, they should be
committed to the ideals and structure of the Debian project.  Ask
yourself if you want to see them in Debian &ndash; if you think they
should be a Debian Developer then go ahead and encourage them to apply.
</p>

<p>Next carry out the following steps: Agree with the prospective member
to recommend them and let them <a href="https://nm.debian.org/public/newnm">sign
up</a>. After that, you have to click on their name in the <a
href="https://nm.debian.org/public/nmlist">listing of Applicants</a>
and go the <q>Advocate this application</q> page. Enter your Debian login
and press the <q>Advocate</q> button. You then will receive an e-mail with an
auth key which you have to return PGP/GPG signed. After this, the 
Applicant is added to the queue for an Application Manager with whom
they will go through all steps of the New Member checks.
