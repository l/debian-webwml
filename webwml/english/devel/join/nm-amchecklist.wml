<A NAME="identification"><H2>Identification Check</H2></A>

<P>If the applicant supplies a signed key, the photo and name and address
   information can be forwarded to the person who signed the key for
   verification. If you can not see what is the provided document itself,
   you can always ask the helps from other members in the NM-Committee.
   You should note that the required information is just "handshake" and
   "eye-ball" portion of the introduction. Please refer the
   <A HREF="./nm-step2">Identification</A> page in our checklist.
</P>

<P>
Additional verification options can be exercised if there is some doubt
about any particular information or the person who provided it.
In the US there are web sites that can do "reverse lookup" of a phone number 
and give you the subscriber, and the address. 
Using these services to cross check the validity of the information provided
by the applicant, can turn up inconsistencies, but the existence of these
inconsistencies does not automatically reject the applicant. Some degree of
negotiation room should be applied to these situations.
</P>

<P>
For instance, if the reverse lookup search turns up another name than
the applicant, you can ask the applicant who's phone number he has given you.
He may say: "It's my room mate's phone/It's my Dad's phone/It's the dorm phone"
which then gives you another point of contact. If you can verify
the information provided by the applicant, the the required contact point
is obtained.
</P>

<P>
As a last resort, when the applicant only misses one point, and it is 
from lack of knowledge, rather than a rejection of the identity,
(i.e. the contact person says they don't think they know this person)
we can use the applicant's ISP to help resolve the issue.
In most cases the applicant will have to give the ISP permission
to release address and phone information. 
Then simply contact the ISP and ask for verification of this info.

<P>
There are two steps involved in the AM's final report on an applicant.

<OL>
  <LI>An e-mail to
      <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A> explaining how the steps
      in the check list have been satisfied. </LI>
  <LI>The same report sent to 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk &lt;new-maintainer@debian.org&gt;</A>
      and 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the DA Manager &lt;da-manager@debian.org&gt;</A>
      with the addition of 
      <UL>
         <LI>The applicants photo ID which is digitized and signed by the applicant</LI>
         <LI>The applicants GPG (or PGP if needed) public key</LI>
         <LI>Logs of the discussions with the applicant to satisfy steps 2-4 in
             <A HREF="./nm-checklist">the checklist</A>.</LI>

<P>
This completes the AM's responsibilities in the application process. 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The DA Manager</A>
must now decide whether the application is successfully completed.
