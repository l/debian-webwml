<H2>AM Checklist for Identification:</H2>
<OL>
    <LI>
  <P>If the applicant supplies a signed key, the photo and name and address
    information should be forwarded to the person who signed the key for
    verification. The key signer should at least be able to say: 
    "Yes I recognize the picture as being the person I met when I signed the key."
  </P>
  <P>If the key signer is a Debian member, an affirmative reply counts
    for two (2) contact points. All other key signers validations are worth 
    one (1) point.
  </P>
  <P>Failure to validate by the signer of the key should be considered grounds
  for rejecting the application, as the remaining points will not be
  sufficient to qualify, and this is considered the most key verification item
  that we can have.
  </P>

Assuming Primary Documentation was presented by the applicant, and step 1
was successful, said documents can be taken as valid on their face. The only
reason to return to these documents is if one of the next steps appears to
end in failure. Depending on the location of the applicant and the manager,
it may be necessary to bring a "local manager" into the process to verify
the existence of the producer of the primary documentation in question, and
possibly the desired applicant information.
</P>
<P>
If the residency documentation is in the form of an affidavit, the one who
signed the affidavit is contacted with the photo and name information, and a
request to verify that this person is resident at the described address.
</P>
<P>
Successful completion of this step gains the applicant one (1) more contact
point.
</P>

    </LI>
    <LI>
<P>
Even a Debian-member-signed-key needs one more point, to be obtained through
a contact person supplied by the applicant. Again, this person must
recognize a photo of the applicant as being the person that they know to be
the applicant.
</P>
<P>
All others have multiple contacts, up to a possible total of three (3) for
those folks with no Primary Documentation. Each of these contacts must make
some positive statements about their knowledge of the identity of the
applicant. While an "I don't think I know this person." reply is not
positive, it can be counter-balanced by other forms of validation.
</P>

    </LI>
    <LI>
<P>
Additional verification options can be exercised if there is some doubt
about any particular information or the person who provided it. In the US
there are web sites that can do "reverse lookup" of a phone number and give
you the subscriber, and the address. Using these services to cross check the
validity of the information provided by the applicant, can turn up
inconsistencies, but the existence of these inconsistencies does not
automatically reject the applicant. Some degree of negotiation room should
be applied to these situations.
</P>
<P>
For instance, if the reverse lookup search turns up another name than the
applicant, you ask the applicant who's phone number he has given you. He
says: "It's my room mate's phone/It's my Dad's phone/It's the dorm phone"
which then gives you another point of contact. If you can verify the
information provided by the applicant, the the required contact point is
obtained.
</P>

    </LI>
    <LI>
<P>
As a last resort, when the applicant only misses one point, and it is from
lack of knowledge, rather than a rejection of the identity, (i.e. the
contact person says they don't think they know this person) we can use the
applicant's ISP to help resolve the issue. In most cases the applicant will
have to give the ISP permission to release address and phone information.
Then simply contact the ISP and ask for verification of this info.
</P>

    </LI>
    <LI>
<P>
If the applicant still doesn't have four (4) points at this stage of the
process, the AM will contact the rest of the AM team for a decision as to
how to proceed with this applicant.
