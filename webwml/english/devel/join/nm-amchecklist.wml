too.

<H2><A NAME="identification">Identification Check</A></H2>

<P>If the applicant supplies a public key which has been signed by 
   a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
   then the identification process is complete.  Only if the key is
   not signed by any current Debian member, the additional photo-ID
   of the applicant will be required.
   Please refer the <A HREF="./nm-step2">Identification</A> page in the 
   checklist.
</P>

<P>There is a compatibility problem with some versions of GnuPG. Please refer
to the section on <A HREF="#gpgversion">GnuPG version compatibilities</A>.</P>

<P>Please also see <A HREF="#signverify">these notes</A> for important
information regarding signature verification.</P>

<P>If your applicant needs the old key for verification purposes, 
they can send it with the new key.</P>

<P>Similarly, if the applicant only has a PGP key which is signed by a
Debian member, they can use it for verification.
</P>

<P>
Additional verification options can be exercised if there is some doubt
about any particular information or the person who provided it.
In the US there are web sites that can do "reverse lookup" of a phone number 
and give you the subscriber, and the address. 
Using these services to cross check the validity of the information provided
by the applicant, can turn up inconsistencies, but the existence of these
inconsistencies does not automatically reject the applicant. Some degree of
negotiation room should be applied to these situations.
</P>

<P>
For instance, if the reverse lookup search turns up another name than
the applicant, you can ask the applicant whose phone number they have given you.
They may say: "It's my roommate's phone" or "It's my Dad's phone" or "It's the
dorm phone" which then gives you another point of contact. If you can verify
the information provided by the applicant, the required contact point
is obtained.
</P>

<P>
As a last resort, when the applicant only misses one point, and it is 
from lack of knowledge, rather than a rejection of the identity,
(i.e. the contact person says they don't think they know this person)
we can use the applicant's ISP to help resolve the issue.
In most cases the applicant will have to give the ISP permission
to release address and phone information. 
Then simply contact the ISP and ask for verification of this info.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="philosophy">Philosophy and Procedures</A></H2>

<p>There isn't much to be said about the philosophy check. See the part of
the <a href="nm-amhowto#ap3">mini-HOWTO</a> that talks about this.

<p>Checking that the applicant knows the procedures for working in Debian
should probably be based on verifying if they know what the Developers'
Reference says about a particular procedure, e.g. closing bugs, doing NMUs,
etc.

<H2><A NAME="skills">Skills and Tasks</A></H2>

<p>If an applicant is joining Debian <I>as a packager</I>, they must
have a package in the archive.  They can do so via the sponsorship
program.  The DAM will <strong>not</strong> accept
applicants who are <em>maybe</em> going to package something at some
unspecified date in the future.

<p>If an applicant is joining Debian <em>to write documentation</em>, it is
also recommended that they have a clear vision on what kind of documents to
write or improve in Debian. (Inspection of documentation previously written
by the applicant is advisable, if any.)

<H2><A NAME="finalreport">Final report from an Application Manager to the NM-Committee:</A></H2>

<P>
There are two steps involved in the AM's final report on an applicant.
</P>
<OL>
  <LI>An e-mail to
      <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A> explaining how the steps
      in the check list have been satisfied. </LI>
  <LI>The same report sent to 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk &lt;new-maintainer@debian.org&gt;</A>
      and 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#DAM">the DA Manager &lt;da-manager@debian.org&gt;</A>
      with the addition of 
      <UL>
	 <LI>The applicants GPG public key <A HREF="#keynote">[1]</A>
              (RSA/IDEA key created by PGP is not accepted now) for 
              incorporation into the Debian keyring
	   <UL>
             <LI>If the GPG key above is not signed by any current Debian member,
                 but the applicant have the signed PGP key, then that PGP public
                 key can be used for Identification</LI>
             <LI>If the applicant has no key signed by any current Debian member,
                 then some Photo-ID of applicants which is digitized and signed
                  by the applicant can be used for Identification</LI>
           </UL>
         </LI>
         <LI>Logs of the discussions with the applicant to satisfy steps 2-4 in
             <A HREF="./nm-checklist">the checklist</A>.</LI>
	 <LI>The request from the applicant for their account name on Debian
             (used as &lt;account&gt;@debian.org) <A HREF="#account">[2]</A></LI>
	 <LI>The request from the applicant for the email address which will
	     be used to forward the emails at &lt;account&gt;@debian.org.</LI>
      </UL>
      <P><A NAME="keynote">[1] Applicants may NOT (repeat: NOT) have a sign only key.</A>
         You can check for this by looking at their key with
         "gpg --list-key &lt;applicant's name or key ID&gt;".
         If you see only a "&lt;number&gt;D/" (usually 1024) and
         no "&lt;number&gt;E/keyID", "&lt;number&gt;e/keyID", nor
         "&lt;number&gt;g/keyID", then it's a sign only DSA key.
         In this case, you AM do have to ask your applicant to generate 
         a proper key.  This is essential to be registered.</P>

      <P><A NAME="account">[2]</A> Account names must be &gt;= 2 characters, 
         3 is better.</P>

  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
This completes the AM's responsibilities in the application process. 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAM">The DA Manager</A>
must now decide whether the application is successfully completed.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="onhold">How to place an applicant on hold</A></H2>

<P>background:
Currently the only reasonable way to put the application "on hold" is 
to reject it with comments. When the applicant is more prepared to work 
on their application they need only send a request to their last AM.
</P>
<P>Note: 
all AM rejections are procedural. At any time that the applicant
feels they can better satisfy the requirements of the application, 
they are free to re-apply, and try again.
</P>

<DL>
  <DT>First, when should an application be placed on hold by an AM?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>Whenever a checklist item is not satisfied.</LI>
       <LI>Whenever too much time has passed without activities from the applicant.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
  <DT>Second, how does an AM do this?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>First leave the "AM Confirms Assignment" field set to "yes",
           do not change this field to "no" or you indicate another AM 
           needs to be assigned to this applicant, which is not the case.</LI>
       <LI>Next set the "AM approves" field to "no", and give details 
           for the rejection in the "Application Manager Comments" field.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
</DL>

<P>
All AMs: 
Feel free to place on hold any applicant that is not ready, willing, and 
able to aggressively pursue their application, as well as those who don't 
have the skills or intentions required by the checklist.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="gpgversion">Version compatibility problem in GnuPG with ElGamal keys handling</A></H2>
<P>&lt;Here is a note from our DAM about GnuPG incompatibility problem.&gt;</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Unfortunately due to a bug in GnuPG with ElGamal key handling there
is now a nasty compatibility problem.
</P>

<P>
The confusing version is: ElG keys created using GnuPG &lt;= 1.0.1 may
erroneously generate BAD signatures, if checked with GnuPG &gt;= 1.0.2.
And vice versa, ElG keys created using GnuPG &gt;= 1.0.2 may erroneously
generate BAD signatures if check with GnuPG &lt;= 1.0.1.
</P>

<P>
The non-confusing version: all AMs should upgrade to GnuPG 1.0.4
 (it's in 2.2 r2 and in woody. Note 1.0.3 has also some bugs, and
anyone using GnuPG should upgrade to 1.0.4); if you have problems
verifying signatures from an applicant,
try adding "--emulate-md-encode-bug" to the command line.
If this fixes it, your applicant has a buggy ElG key.  Get them to
install GnuPG 1.0.2 and generate another one.
(If they need the old one for verification purposes, simply include
both of them in the report to da-manager@)
</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2><A NAME="signverify">Important Notes regarding signature
verification</A></H2>

<P>It is <B>essential</B> that you use --check-sigs for verifying
signatures on keys of applicants, and <B>not</B> --list-sigs, as this does
not validate the signatures.
<P>Also remember that it is always better to refer to the fingerprint of a key
rather than the shortened key ID, the probability of a collision is
significantly less due to the larger namespace.
