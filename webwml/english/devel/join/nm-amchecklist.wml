<H2><A NAME="identification">Identification Check</A></H2>

<P>If the applicant supplies a public key which has been signed by 
   a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
   then the identification process is complete.  Only if the key is
   not signed by any current Debian member, the additional photo-ID
   of the applicant will be required.
   Please refer the <A HREF="./nm-step2">Identification</A> page in the 
   checklist.
</P>

<P>
Additional verification options can be exercised if there is some doubt
about any particular information or the person who provided it.
In the US there are web sites that can do "reverse lookup" of a phone number 
and give you the subscriber, and the address. 
Using these services to cross check the validity of the information provided
by the applicant, can turn up inconsistencies, but the existence of these
inconsistencies does not automatically reject the applicant. Some degree of
negotiation room should be applied to these situations.
</P>

<P>
For instance, if the reverse lookup search turns up another name than
the applicant, you can ask the applicant who's phone number he has given you.
He may say: "It's my room mate's phone/It's my Dad's phone/It's the dorm phone"
which then gives you another point of contact. If you can verify
the information provided by the applicant, the the required contact point
is obtained.
</P>

<P>
As a last resort, when the applicant only misses one point, and it is 
from lack of knowledge, rather than a rejection of the identity,
(i.e. the contact person says they don't think they know this person)
we can use the applicant's ISP to help resolve the issue.
In most cases the applicant will have to give the ISP permission
to release address and phone information. 
Then simply contact the ISP and ask for verification of this info.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="finalreport">Final report from an Application Manager to the NM-Committee:</A></H2>

      with the addition of 
      <UL>
	 <LI>The applicants GPG public key (RSA/IDEA key created by PGP is

         <LI>If the GPG key above is not signed by any current Debian member,

         <LI>The applicants photo-ID which is digitized and signed by

</P>

<P>
This completes the AM's responsibilities in the application process. 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The DA Manager</A>
must now decide whether the application is successfully completed.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="onhold">How to place an applicant on hold</A></H2>

<P>background:
Currently the only reasonable way to put the application "on hold" is 
to reject it with comments. When the applicant is more prepared to work 
on his application he need only send a request to his last AM.
</P>
<P>Note: 
all AM rejections are procedural. At any time that the applicant
feels they can better satisfy the requirements of the application, 
they are free to re-apply, and try again.
</P>

<P>
 <DL>
  <DT>First, when should an application be placed on hold by an AM?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>Whenever a checklist item is not satisfied.</LI>
       <LI>Whenever too much time has passed without activities from the applicant.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
  <DT>Second, how does an AM do this?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>First leave the "AM Confirms Assignment" field set to "yes",
           do not change this field to "no" or you indicate another AM 
           needs to be assigned to this applicant, which is not the case.</LI>
       <LI>Next set the "AM approves" field to "no", and give details 
           for the rejection in the "Application Manager Comments" field.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
 </DL>
</P>

<P>
All AMs: 
Feel free to place on hold any applicant that is not ready, willing, and 
able to agressively persue their application, as well as those who don't 
have the skills or intentions required by the checklist.
</P>
