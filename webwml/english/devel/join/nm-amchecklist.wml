<H2><A NAME="identification">Identification Check</A></H2>

<P>If the applicant supplies a signed key, the photo and name and address
   information can be forwarded to the person who signed the key for
   verification. If you can not see what is the provided document itself,
   you can always ask the helps from other members in the NM-Committee.
   You should note that the required information is just "handshake" and
   "eye-ball" portion of the introduction. Please refer the
   <A HREF="./nm-step2">Identification</A> page in our checklist.
</P>

<P>
Additional verification options can be exercised if there is some doubt
about any particular information or the person who provided it.
In the US there are web sites that can do "reverse lookup" of a phone number 
and give you the subscriber, and the address. 
Using these services to cross check the validity of the information provided
by the applicant, can turn up inconsistencies, but the existence of these
inconsistencies does not automatically reject the applicant. Some degree of
negotiation room should be applied to these situations.
</P>

<P>
For instance, if the reverse lookup search turns up another name than
the applicant, you can ask the applicant who's phone number he has given you.
He may say: "It's my room mate's phone/It's my Dad's phone/It's the dorm phone"
which then gives you another point of contact. If you can verify
the information provided by the applicant, the the required contact point
is obtained.
</P>

<P>
As a last resort, when the applicant only misses one point, and it is 
from lack of knowledge, rather than a rejection of the identity,
(i.e. the contact person says they don't think they know this person)
we can use the applicant's ISP to help resolve the issue.
In most cases the applicant will have to give the ISP permission
to release address and phone information. 
Then simply contact the ISP and ask for verification of this info.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="finalreport">Final report from an Application Manager to the NM-Committee:</A></H2>

<P>
There are two steps involved in the AM's final report on an applicant.
</P>
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>An e-mail to
      <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A> explaining how the steps
      in the check list have been satisfied. </LI>
  <LI>The same report sent to 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk &lt;new-maintainer@debian.org&gt;</A>
      and 
      <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the DA Manager &lt;da-manager@debian.org&gt;</A>
      with the addition of 
      <UL>
         <LI>The applicants photo ID which is digitized and signed by the applicant</LI>
         <LI>The applicants GPG (or PGP if needed) public key for Identification</LI>
         <LI>Logs of the discussions with the applicant to satisfy steps 2-4 in
             <A HREF="./nm-checklist">the checklist</A>.</LI>
      </UL>
      and
      <UL>
	 <LI>The applicants GPG public key (RSA/IDEA keys created by PGP is 
             not accepted now) to sign his (or her) Debian packages.
             This will be incorporated into the Keyring of Debian</LI>
	 <LI>The request from the applicant for their account name on Debian
             (used as &lt;account&gt;@debian.org)</LI>
	 <LI>The request from the applicant for the email address which will
	     be used to forward the emails at &lt;account&gt;@debian.org.</LI>
      </UL>
  </LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>
This completes the AM's responsibilities in the application process. 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The DA Manager</A>
must now decide whether the application is successfully completed.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="rejection"></A>How to reject an applicant</H2>

<P>background:
Currently the only reasonable way to put the application "on hold" is 
to reject it with comments. When the applicant is more prepared to work 
on his application he need only send a request to his last AM.
</P>
<P>Note: 
all AM rejections are procedural. At any time that the applicant
feels they can better satisfy the requirements of the application, 
they are free to re-apply, and try again.
</P>

<P>
 <DL>
  <DT>First, when should an application be rejected by an AM?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>Whenever a checklist item is not satisfied.</LI>
       <LI>Whenever too much time has passed without activities from the applicant.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
  <DT>Second, how does an AM do this?</DT>
   <DD>
     <UL>
       <LI>First leave the "AM confirms assignment" field set to "yes",
           do not change this field to "no" or you indicate another AM 
           needs to be assigned to this applicant, which is not the case.</LI>
       <LI>Next set the "AM accepts" field to "no", and give details 
           for the rejection in the "AM comments" field.</LI>
     </UL>
   </DD>
 </DL>
</P>

<P>
All AMs: 
Feel free to reject any applicant that is not ready, willing, and able to 
agressively persue their application, as well as those who don't have the 
skills or intentions required by the checklist. This looks like a cheap 
"slash and burn" approach to the glut of applicants, but it appears to be 
a neccessary addition currently.
