<H2>Step 10: The Phone Contact</H2>
<P>
The Developer Accounts Managers have one job to do before the accounts can
be created, and the mailing lists subscribed. That is the phone contact
with the applicant.
</P>
<P>
The DA Managers will determine how this phone contact will be done. The 
usual method will be for the DA Manager to provide a phone number to the
applicant, which will be used to contact the DA Manager. The applicant
can then provide a number for a "call back" by the DA Manager.
</P>
<P>
The DA Managers may delegate this job to a "local manager" at their
discretion. In either case the DA Manager will determine the scope of the
conversation with the applicant.
</P>
<P>
This phone conversation should cover the following ideas:
<OL>
     <LI>Does the applicant understand the Social Contract and the DFSG?</LI>
     <LI>Does the applicant understand our policies and procedures?</LI>
     <LI>In addition to understanding, is there a degree of commitment
        to these principles.</LI>
     <LI>Gain a general understanding of the applicant's skills.</LI>
</OL>
