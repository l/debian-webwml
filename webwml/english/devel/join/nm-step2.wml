<P>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to future Debian developers.</P>

<H2>Step 2: Identification</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">Debian</A>
is an association or a club, much like your local LUG or Rotary,
with the principle exception being that we hardly ever meet face-to-face.
This poses a problem for the initial introduction process with Debian.
At your LUG, everyone meets from time to time in a cozy location where 
everyone can shake hands and "eyeball" the other member.
As Debian lacks many opportunities for this eye/hand connection,
the identification process must close the loop between hand and eye.
</P>

<P>
The prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
must be able to provide his/her GPG public key and some kind of ID
at some stage. 
Please check <A HREF="#conditions">Conditions</A> below for details.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
supplies a GPG public key which has been signed by a current 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
then the identification process is complete since that member
who signed his/her key must have checked some kind of ID at that time.
See <A HREF="#key_signature">tips for getting your key signed</A>.
</LI>

<LI>Additional photo-ID will only be required if his/her key is not signed
by a current Debian member.</LI>

</UL>

<P>
GPG public key is important.  Please read the README file in the 
<code>debian-keyring</code> package for a detailed background.
</P>

<P>
Please make sure that your GPG public key can be found on one of the
<A HREF="http://wwwkeys.us.pgp.net/">public key servers</A>.  You can
export your public key using:</P>
<pre>
gpg --send-key --keyserver germany.keyserver.net  yourkeyid
</pre>


<P>Note: ElGamal signatures generated by GPG &lt;= 1.0.1 are
incompatible with later versions.  Such signatures must be
regenerated by GPG &gt;= 1.0.2.

ElGamal keys themselves do <em>not</em> need to be regenerated.
Only the signatures created by ElGamal keys.</P>

<P>
You should upgrade GPG to version &gt;= 1.0.4, since the older
version has serious bugs which could lead to false signature
verification results.  See
<code>/usr/share/doc/gnupg/changelog.Debian.gz</code>
in the gnupg package for details.</P>

<P>
The ID image file itself must be signed using the applicant's key 
and delivered, along with a copy of the applicant's public key, to
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
assigned by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>.
</P>

<P>
Note that hiding irrelevant information on the image for privacy reasons is
allowed. The important thing about this photo-ID is that the name and photo
are legible. Also, please make sure that you've reduced the size of the
image file before sending it.
</P>

<P>
If the applicant does <strong>not</strong> have any photo-ID such as a
drivers license or a passport, then any photo of him would do.  But in such
a case, the trusted verification path (such as an employer, or faculty
member) needs to be provided, and the final report needs to explain that.
</P>

<HR>

<H3><A name="conditions">Conditions:</A></H3>
<P>
The above items, when delivered to the Application Manager (AM),
constitute the "handshake" portion of the introduction. 
The "eye-ball" portion of the introduction can be 
satisfied by meeting one of several possible conditions.
</P>

<P>Note: The primary and vastly preferred method of passing the ID 
check for applicants is to have a Debian developer's signature on their
GPG public key. The AM should always check to see if it's possible
for the applicant to get his key signed by meeting another developer.
See <A HREF="#key_signature">tips for getting your key signed</A>.
</P>

<P>Obviously, if the applicant is our first developer from the Antarctic,
then it'll be infeasible to require him to get his key signed. However,
applicants living in major American cities, for example, where there surely
are some Debian developers, should try to find someone to sign their key.</P>

<P>If an applicant has tried and failed to get their public key signed by a
Debian member, the AM should explain the situation in the final report to
the DAM.</P>


<OL>
  <LI> If your GPG (or PGP in some cases) key has been signed by 
       a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
       your identification is complete.  In this case, the signed key 
       need not be accompanied by additional photo-ID, since the Debian 
       member signing the key must have seen and verified either a passport
       or some other picture ID document (The AM may or may not ask the
       developer who signed the applicant's key about their impression of
       that applicant).
  </LI>

  <LI> The applicant may provide a contact person who can verify that
       the person on the picture (provided by the applicant) is really
       who they say they are.
  </LI>
       
  <LI> The applicant and the AM may work out some other mechanism to
       "close the eye-ball loop", presuming that it is acceptable to 
       the rest of <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A>.
  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Satisfaction of the identification requirements can happen in parallel with 
the other activities required of the applicant, but it must be complete before
the application can be completed.
</P>


<H3><A name="key_signature">How to get signatures on your GPG key</A></H3>
<P>
Usually, requests and announces of key signing party are seen on
debian-devel list, so you should check/post there carefully.</P>
<P>
If you are looking for developers in any specific areas to sign your
GPG public key, the
<A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/gpg.php">key signing
coordination page</A> may be of help.</P>

<P>You can also send e-mail to <kbd>gpg-coord@nm.debian.org</kbd> telling us where
you live exactly (plus naming some big cities close to you), then we
can check in the developer database for developers who are near you.</P>

<P>Once you find someone to sign your key, you should follow the steps
in the <A HREF="$(HOME)/events/keysigning">Keysigning Mini-HOWTO</A>.</P>
