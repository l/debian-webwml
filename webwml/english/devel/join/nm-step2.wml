<H2>Step 2: Identification</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">Debian</A>
is an association or club, much like your local LUG or Rotary,
with the principle exception being that we hardly ever meet face-to-face.
This poses a problem for the initial introduction process with Debian.
At your LUG, everyone meets from time to time in a cozy location where 
everyone can shake hands and "eyeball" the other member.
As Debian lacks many opportunities for this eye/hand connection,
the identification process must close the loop between hand and eye.
</P>

<P>
The prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
must be able to provide his/her GPG public key and some kind of ID
at some stage. 
Please check <A HREF="#conditions">Conditions</A> below for more detail.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
supplies a GPG public key which has been signed by a current 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
then the identification process is complete since that member
who signed his/her key must have checked some kind of ID at that time.
If you are looking for developers in any specific areas to sign your
GPG public key, the
<A HREF="http://oink.cc.ntu.edu.tw/~cklin/signing/">key signing
coordination page</A> may be of help.
</LI>

<LI>Only if the key is not signed by any current Debian member, 
the additional photo-ID of the applicant will be required.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
GPG public key is important.  Please check the README file in the 
debian-keyring package to know the detail backgrounds.
</P>
<P>Note: ElGamal keys must be generated by GPG &gt;= 1.0.2</P>
   
<P>
The ID image file itself must be signed using the applicant's key 
and delivered, along with a copy of the applicant's public key to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
assigned by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>.
</P>
<P>
Note that there is no problem about hiding the irrelevant informations
in order to keep your privacy.  The important thing in this photo-ID 
is that the name and photo are legible.  And also please take care to 
reduce the size of image file with enough resolution bofore sending it 
in your mail.
</P>
<P>
If the applicant does NOT have any photo-ID such as a drivers license
or Passport, then any photo of him would do.  But in such a case, the
trusted verification path (such as an employer, or faculty member) may
be provided, and the final report may explain that.
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A name="conditions">Conditions:</A></H3>
<P>
The above items, when delivered to the Application Manager (AM),
constitute the "handshake" portion of the introduction. 
The "eye-ball" portion of the introduction can be 
satisfied by meeting one of several possible conditions.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI> If your GPG (or PGP in some cases) key has been signed by 
       a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
       your identification is complete.  In this case, the signed key 
       need not be accompanied by additional photo-ID, as the Debian 
       member signing the key has seen and verified either a Passport 
       or some other picture ID document (The AM may or may not ask
       the signing member about the impression of that applicant).
  </LI>

  <LI> The applicant may provide a contact person who can verify,
       from the image file provided, that they recognize this person 
       by image and by name.
  </LI>
       
  <LI> Any other mechanism that the applicant and their AM may 
       work out to "close the eye-ball loop" that is acceptable to 
       the rest of 
       <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">the NM-Committee</A>
       may be used to complete the identification.

  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Satisfaction of the identification requirements can happen in parallel with 
the other activities required of the applicant, but it must be complete before
the application can be completed.
