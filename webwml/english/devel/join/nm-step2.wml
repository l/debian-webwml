<H2>Step 2: Identification</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">Debian</A>
is an association or club, much like your local LUG or Rotary,
with the principle exception being that we hardly ever meet face-to-face.
This poses a problem for the initial introduction process with Debian.
At your LUG, everyone meets from time to time in a cozy location where 
everyone can shake hands and "eyeball" the other member.
As Debian lacks many opportunities for this eye/hand connection,
the identification process must close the loop between hand and eye.
</P>

<P>
The prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
must be able to provide his/her GPG public key and some kind of ID
at some stage. 
Please check <A HREF="#conditions">Conditions</A> below for more detail.
</P>

<UL>
<LI>If the prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
supplies a GPG public key which has been signed by a current 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
then the identification process is complete since that member
who signed his/her key must have checked some kind of ID at that time.
See <A HREF="#key_signature">tips for getting signature</A>.
</LI>

<LI>Only if the key is not signed by any current Debian member, 
the additional photo-ID of the applicant will be required.</LI>
</UL>

<P>
GPG public key is important.  Please check the README file in the 
debian-keyring package to know the detail backgrounds.
</P>

<P>
Please make sure that your GPG public key can be found on one of the
<A HREF="http://wwwkeys.us.pgp.net/">public key servers</A>.  You can
export your public key using:
<pre>
gpg --send-key --keyserver germany.keyserver.net  yourkeyid
</pre>
</P>

<P>Note: ElGamal signatures generated by GPG &lt;= 1.0.1 are
incompatible with later versions.  Such signatures must be
regenerated by GPG &gt;= 1.0.2.

ElGamal keys themselves do <em>not</em> need to be regenerated.
Only the signatures created by ElGamal keys.</P>

<P>
You should upgrade GPG to version &gt;= 1.0.4, since the older
version has serious bugs which could lead to false signature
verification results.  See changelog.Debian in gnupg package
for details.</P>

<P>
The ID image file itself must be signed using the applicant's key 
and delivered, along with a copy of the applicant's public key to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
assigned by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>.
</P>
<P>
Note that there is no problem about hiding the irrelevant informations
in order to keep your privacy.  The important thing in this photo-ID 
is that the name and photo are legible.  And also please take care to 
reduce the size of image file with enough resolution before sending it 
in your mail.
</P>
<P>
If the applicant does NOT have any photo-ID such as a drivers license
or Passport, then any photo of him would do.  But in such a case, the
trusted verification path (such as an employer, or faculty member) may
be provided, and the final report may explain that.
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A name="conditions">Conditions:</A></H3>
<P>
The above items, when delivered to the Application Manager (AM),
constitute the "handshake" portion of the introduction. 
The "eye-ball" portion of the introduction can be 
satisfied by meeting one of several possible conditions.
</P>

<P>Note: The primary and vastly preferred method of passing the ID 
check is to have a Debian developer's signature on the public key of
the applicant.  The AM should always check to see if it's possible
for the applicant to get his key signed by meeting another developer.
See <A HREF="#key_signature">tips for getting signature</A>.
Obviously if the applicant is our first developer from the Antarctic,
then it'll be infeasible to require him to get his key signed, but
applicants in, e.g. major American cities where it is supposed that
there are current Debian developers, should try to find someone to 
sign on their key, and should not fall back on the scanned ID thing
without even trying.  And the AM should explain clearly the case in
the final report to the DAM when the applicant has tried but failed
to get signature of Debian member on his/her public key.</P>


<OL>
  <LI> If your GPG (or PGP in some cases) key has been signed by 
       a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
       your identification is complete.  In this case, the signed key 
       need not be accompanied by additional photo-ID, since the Debian 
       member signing the key should (&amp; must) have seen and verified
       either a Passport or some other picture ID document (The AM may 
       or may not ask the signing member about the impression of that 
       applicant).
  </LI>

  <LI> The applicant may provide a contact person who can verify,
       from the image file provided, that they recognize this person 
       by image and by name.
  </LI>
       
  <LI> Any other mechanism that the applicant and their AM may 
       work out to "close the eye-ball loop" that is acceptable to 
       the rest of 
       <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A>
       may be used to complete the identification.

  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Satisfaction of the identification requirements can happen in parallel with 
the other activities required of the applicant, but it must be complete before
the application can be completed.

<P>
Usually, requests and announces of key signing party are seen on
debian-devel list, so you should check/post there carefully.</P>
<P>
If you are looking for developers in any specific areas to sign your
GPG public key, the
<A HREF="http://oink.cc.ntu.edu.tw/~cklin/signing/">key signing
coordination page</A> may be of help.</P>
