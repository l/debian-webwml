<H2>Step 2: Identification</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">Debian</A>
is an association or club, much like your local LUG or Rotary,
with the principle exception being that we hardly ever meet face-to-face.
This poses a problem for the initial introduction process with Debian.
At your LUG, everyone meets from time to time in a cozy location where 
everyone can shake hands and "eyeball" the other member.
As Debian lacks many opportunities for this eye/hand connection,
the identification process must close the loop between hand and eye.
</P>

<P>
The prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
must be able to produce two items:
</P>
<OL>
 <LI>A digital GPG public key, suitable for inclusion on a key-ring.</LI>
 <LI>An image file of an appropriate piece of photo-identification
     when required (see <A HREF="#conditions">Conditions</A> below).</LI>
</OL>

<P>
GPG public key is important.  Please check the README file in the 
debian-keyring package to know the detail backgrounds (You should
aviod RSA/IDEA patent problem).  Also note that some compatability 
problem between GnuPG &lt;= 1.0.1 and &gt;= 1.0.2 has been reported about
ElGamal key handling.  If you use ElGamal key,  you should install
GnuPG &gt;= 1.0.2 (the package is in woody) and generate another key.
If you need the old one for verification purposes, you can send it
with the new key.  Similarly, if you have only PGP key which is 
signed by current Debian member, you can use it for verification.
</P>
   
<P>
The ID image file itself must be signed using the applicant's key 
and delivered, along with a copy of the applicant's public key to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
assigned by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>.
</P>
<P>
Note that there is no problem about hiding the irrelevant informations
in order to keep your privacy.  The important thing in this photo-ID 
is that the name and photo are legible.  And also please take care to 
reduce the size of image file with enough resolution bofore sending it 
in your mail.
</P>
<P>
If the applicant does NOT have any photo-ID such as a drivers license
or Passport, then any photo of him would do.  But in such a case, the
trusted verification path (such as an employer, or faculty member) may
be provided, and the final report may explain that.
</P>
<HR>
<H3><A name="conditions">Conditions:</A></H3>
<P>
The above items, when delivered to the Application Manager (AM),
constitute the "handshake" portion of the introduction. 
The "eye-ball" portion of the introduction can be 
satisfied by meeting one of several possible conditions.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI> If your GPG (or PGP in some cases) key has been signed by 
       a current <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
       your identification is complete.  In this case, the signed key 
       need not be accompanied by additional photo-ID, as the Debian 
       member signing the key has seen and verified either a Passport 
       or some other picture ID document (The AM may or may not ask
       the signing member about the impression of that applicant).
  </LI>

  <LI> The applicant may provide a contact person who can verify,
       from the image file provided, that they recognize this person 
       by image and by name.
  </LI>
       
  <LI> Any other mechanism that the applicant and their AM may 
       work out to "close the eye-ball loop" that is acceptable to 
       the rest of 
       <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">the NM-Committee</A>
       may be used to complete the identification.

  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Satisfaction of the identification requirements can happen in parallel with 
the other activities required of the applicant, but it must be complete before
the application can be completed.
