be of interest to future Debian developers.</p>


<h2>Step 2: Identification</h2>

<h3>Why OpenPGP?</h3>

<p>Debian makes extensive use of OpenPGP because <a 
href="newmaint#Member">Debian members</a> are located all over the world
(see the <a href="$(DEVEL)/developers.loc">developer locations</a>) and rarely
meet each other in person. This means trust cannot be built up by
personal contact and other means are necessary. All Debian developers
are identified by their <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">OpenPGP</a>
key. These keys make it possible to authenticate messages and
other data by signing it. For more information on OpenPGP keys
see the README file in the <code>debian-keyring</code> package.</p>

<h3>Providing a key</h3>

<p>Each <a href="newmaint#Applicant">Applicant</a> must provide an
OpenPGP version 4 public key with encryption capabilities. The 
preferred way to do this is to export it to one of the public key
servers, such as <tt>subkeys.pgp.net</tt>.
Public keys can be exported using:</p>
<pre>
gpg --send-key --keyserver &lt;server address&gt; &lt;yourkeyid&gt;
</pre>

<p>If your key has no encryption capability, you can simply add
an encryption subkey.</p>

<p>See <a href="http://keyring.debian.org/">keyring.debian.org</a>
for more information on key formats and properties.</p>


<h3>Verification</h3>

<p>Since anyone can upload a public key to the servers it needs
to be verified that the key belongs to the Applicant.</p>

<p>To accomplish this the public key itself must be signed by two other 
<a href="newmaint#Member">Debian members</a>. Therefore the
Applicant must meet this Debian member in person and must 
identify himself (by providing a passport, a driver's license 
or some other ID).</p>


<h4><a name="key_signature">How to get your OpenPGP key signed</a></h4>

<p>There are several ways to find a Debian member for a key
exchange. You should try them in the order listed below:</p>

<ol>

<li>Announcements of key signing parties are usually posted on the
<code>debian-devel</code> mailing list, so check there first.</li>

<li><p>You can look for developers in specific areas through the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Keysigning">key signing coordination page</a>:</p>

<ul>
      <li>First you should check the list of key signing offers for a Debian
	member near you.</li>
      <li>If you cannot find a Debian member among the key signing offers,
	you can register your key signing request.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>If no one has reacted to your request for several weeks, send an
e-mail to <email debian-private@lists.debian.org> telling them exactly
where you live (plus naming some big cities close to you),
then they can check in the developer database for developers who are
near you.</li>

</ol>

<p>Once you find someone to sign your key, you should follow the steps
in the <a href="$(HOME)/events/keysigning">Keysigning Mini-HOWTO</a>.</p>

<p>It is recommended that you also sign the Debian Developer's
key. This is not necessary for your ID check but it strengthens the
web of trust.</p>


<h4>When you can't get your key signed</h4>

<p>If all of the steps above fail, please contact the 
<a href="newmaint#FrontDesk">Front Desk</a> and ask for help. They may
offer you an alternate way of identification.</p>
