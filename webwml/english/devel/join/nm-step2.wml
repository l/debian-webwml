<H1>-- NOTE:This is unofficial private test page --</H1>
<P>Please do not rely on the information in this page.
These are subject to change without notice.</P>

<P>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to Debian developers in future.</P>

<H2>Step 2: The reply from the Front Desk</H2>
<P>
In response to the initial contact by the applicant, the person manning
the "Front Desk" will send instructions on how to prepare and submit 
identification materials to the applicant. The requested information will 
be returned to the Front Desk using e-mail, with the image of the scanned 
documents attached to that e-mail. When such scans are not available the
applicant will mail these documents to the address provided by the Front 
Desk.
</P>
<H3>Identification Materials</H3>
<P>
The applicant must supply two items of identification:
<OL>
   <LI>A pgp or gpg encoded key.</LI>
   <LI>Supporting Identification Documents.</LI>
</OL>
</P>    
<H3>Security Keys:</H3>
<P>
The level of security provided by a pgp or gpg key depends upon how,
and if, it has been signed. The application process recognizes three 
types of key signing, in order of preference:
<OL>
     <LI>Key is signed by a current Debian member.</LI>
     <LI>Key is signed by a current citizen of the Internet.</LI>
     <LI>Key is unsigned.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<H3>Supporting Identification Documents:</H3>
<P>
The Supporting Identification Documents along with the key, must provide
4 points of contact. A key, signed by a Debian member, constitutes 2 points
of contact, while any other signature provided constitutes 1 point of contact.
</P>
<P>
Multiple signatures do not increase the number of points acquired, so two
Debian members signing the applicant's key still only deliver 2 contact points.
Two or more signatures from non-Debian members still only counts as 1 point.
</P>
<P>
An unsigned key does not count toward contact points as it only represents
the applicant, who is not considered a "point of contact" for identification 
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The application process recognizes two forms of SID: primary and secondary.
</P>
<H3>Primary Documentation:</H3>
<P>
Primary Documentation consists of paperwork not created by the applicant.
The following constitute the necessary components of Primary Documentation:
<OL>
    <LI>Either a passport, a photo drivers license, or official photo ID.</LI>
    <LI>Either a rent receipt, utility/phone bill, or credit card bill.
	<P>
          This document must contain the applicant's name and address.
	  Any security information other than name and address may be
	  blacked out by the applicant, to insure privacy.
	</P>
   </LI>
</OL>
Providing one document from each of the two areas described above, provides 
one (1) point of contact.
</P>
<H3>Secondary Documentation:</H3>
<P>
Secondary Documentation consists of paperwork created by the applicant.
Under circumstances where there is no Primary Documentation, the following
information is mandatory:
<UL>
    <LI>Photograph of applicant.</LI>
    <LI>Name of applicant.</LI>
    <LI>Permanent Address.</LI>
    <LI>Current address, if different from Permanent.</LI>
    <LI>At least one phone number for personal contact.</LI>
</UL>
This information will be corroborated by other points of contact which the
applicant will supply, and thus constitutes zero (0) points of contact.
</P>
<P>
An additional point of contact can be obtained by providing a rent, utility,
or phone bill/receipt that includes the applicants name, and one of either 
the phone number or address information. A statement of residence, signed by
either a landlord, dorm counselor, or other such person as can attest to
the residence of the applicant, will constitute a rent receipt, as long
as the address of the signator is provided.
</P>
<P>
Up to three (3) additional contact points can be produced by providing the
name and address of a person we can contact who knows the applicant well 
enough to be willing to act as an emergency contact for the applicant.
Only one of these contact points can be co-resident with the applicant. 
(i.e. Mother, Mother-in-law, Wife, Girl Friend, Room Mate, etc...)
</P>
<P>
The best application consists of:
<OL>
     <LI>A pgp/gpg key signed by a Debian member.</LI>
     <LI>Complete Primary Documentation.</LI>
     <LI>One additional contact person.</LI>
</OL>
This application can be processed in a minimal amount of time.
</P>
<P>
The minimum acceptable application consists of:
<OL>
     <LI>An unsigned pgp/gpg key.</LI>
     <LI>Secondary personal identification information.</LI>
     <LI>A rent/utility/phone receipt, or affidavit.</LI>
     <LI>Three additional contact persons.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>
This application identification could take several weeks to a month to 
process, and while this can run in parallel to the other activities of the
applicant, it will most certainly slow down the process. The team will do 
what it can to move the process along, but many of the details are in the 
hands of others, and delays will be inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Once the identification material has been submitted, the applicant can move 
on to the next step.
