<H2>Step 2: Identification</H2>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">Debian</A>
is an association or club, much like your local LUG or Rotary,
with the principle exception being that we hardly ever meet face-to-face.
This poses a problem for the initial introduction process with Debian.
At your LUG, everyone meets from time to time in a cozy location where 
everyone can shake hands and "eyeball" the other member.
As Debian lacks many opportunities for this eye/hand connection,
the identification process must close the loop between hand and eye.
</P>

<P>
The prospective 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>
must be able to produce two items:
</P>
<OL>
 <LI>An image file of an appropriate piece of photo-identification.</LI>
 <LI>A digital gpg (or pgp if needed) public key, suitable for inclusion on a key-ring.</LI>
</OL>
   
<P>
The ID image file must be signed using the applicant's key and delivered,
along with a copy of the applicant's public key to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
assigned by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>.
It is insufficient to sign the mail which includes the photo-ID as a whole.
You should make sure to sign the ID image file itself.
</P>
<P>
Note that there is no problem about hiding the irrelevant informations
in order to keep your privacy.  The important thing in this photo-ID is 
that the name and photo are legible.
</P>
<P>
If the applicant does NOT have any photo-ID such as a drivers license
or Passport, then any photo of him would do.  But in such a case, the
trusted verification path (such as some current members of Debian) may
be provided, and the final report may explain that.
</P>
<HR>
<H3>Conditions:</H3>
<P>
The above items, when delivered to the Application Manager (AM),
constitute the "handshake" portion of the introduction. 
The "eye-ball" portion of the introduction can be 
satisfied by meeting one of several possible conditions.
</P>

<OL>
  <LI> If your gpg (or pgp if needed) key has been signed by a current 
       <A HREF="./newmaint#Member">member</A> of Debian,
       your identification is complete, when that key is
       among the two required items mentioned above.

  </LI>

  <LI> The applicant may provide a contact person who can verify,
       from the image file provided, that they recognize this person 
       by image and by name.

  </LI>
       
  <LI> Any other mechanism that the applicant and their AM may 
       work out to "close the eye-ball loop" that is acceptable to 
       the rest of 
       <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">the NM-Committee</A>
       may be used to complete the identification.

  </LI>
</OL>

<P>
Satisfaction of the identification requirements can happen in parallel with 
the other activities required of the applicant, but it must be complete before
the application can be completed.
