<h2>Step 7: Debian Account Manager check and account creation</h2>

<p>The <a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Manager</a> has to make
the final decision about the account creation. If any major problems 
in the application are found, it is either directly rejected or given
back to the <a href="./newmaint#FrontDesk">Front Desk</a>, which decides
how to complete the application.</p>

<p>There are some problems that always lead to a rejection:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Failure to provide adequate identification.</li>
 <li>Failure to agree to our principles and procedures.</li>
 <li>Failure to complete the tasks the Applicant agreed to do with
     their Application Manager.</li>
</ul>
	    
<p>When the <a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Managers</a> are
satisfied with the complete application, they ask the Debian Keyring maintainers
to add the Applicant's key, and the Debian System Administrators to create the
necessary accounts for the Applicant and subscribe the Applicant to
the debian-private mailing list.</p>

<p>Once all the final details of membership have been completed by the 
<a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Managers</a>, the Applicant,
their AM and the debian-project mailing list will be informed.</p>
