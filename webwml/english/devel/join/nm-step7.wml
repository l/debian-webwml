<H2>Step 7: Manager's Report</H2>
<P>
When the applicant has completed the performance tests, expressed an
understanding of the DFSG and Debian policies and procedures, and been
properly identified, it is time for the Application Manager to make a 
report to The Committee.
</P>
<P>
This report should include the information that provides the 4 points of 
contact that verify the identity and residence of the applicant. At least 
a sample of the discussion detailing the applicants understanding of the
DFSG and the Social Contract should be included in the report. The details 
of the performance testing are the final points to be listed in this report. 
</P>
<P>
This list may include packages delivered, documentation written or updated, 
QA work completed, or whatever task the applicant and manager have determined
adequately test the performance of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
The Application Manager will include a recommendation for either acceptance of
the applicant, or their rejection. This recommendation should come with 
specific reasons for the rejection or acceptance of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
The Application Manager will deliver the report to The Committee for assessment. 
</P>
<P>
All submitted electronic identification documents will be sent to the Front
Desk for archival.
