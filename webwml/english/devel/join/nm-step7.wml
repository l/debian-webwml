<h2>Step 7: Debian Account Manager check and account creation</h2>

<p>The <a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Manager</a> has to make
the final decision about the account creation. If any major problems 
in the application are found, it is either directly rejected or given
back to the <a href="./newmaint#FrontDesk">Front Desk</a>, which decides
how to complete the application.</p>

<p>There are some problems that always lead to a rejection:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Failure to provide adequate identification.</li>
 <li>Failure to agree to our principles and procedures.</li>
 <li>Failure to complete the tasks the Applicant agreed to do with
     their Application Manager.</li>
</ul>
	    
<p>When the <a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Managers</a> are
satisfied with the complete application, they will create the 
necessary accounts for the Applicant and subscribe the Applicant to
the debian-private mailing lists.</p>

<p>Once all the final details of membership have been completed by the 
<a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Managers</a>, the Applicant,
their AM and the debian-project mailing list will be informed.</p>
