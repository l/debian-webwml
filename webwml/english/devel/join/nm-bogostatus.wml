<H2>Current Bogo Status</H2>
<P>
Here is a temporary work around until we can use the "real" status board.
The information on this page are delayed for several days, or worse
(maybe a few weeks), but it may be better than nothing.
</P>
<P>
I hope we can use the "real" status board soon, so I don't want
to put too much work on this page. If you can do work for status page,
then please help the task for our "real" status board.
