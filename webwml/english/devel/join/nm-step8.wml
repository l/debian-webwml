<H2>Step 8: Committee Determination</H2>
<P>
The Committee now has the responsibility to determine from the Manager's
report whether or not all the requirements have been met. This is simply
a check of the report to verify that all the required information has 
been completed.
</P>
<P>
The Committee may make recommendations or requests for additional information
or some other demonstration of skill if the report does not seem complete.
</P>
<P>
Only if any of the critical items can not be completed by the applicant, will
the application be rejected. These include:
<UL>
    <LI>Failure to provide adequate identification.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to agree to our principles and procedures.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to deliver mutually agreed upon projects.</LI>
</UL>
While failure to meet deadlines may indicate incapability, but some extension 
of these deadlines is certainly reasonable. However, considering that the 
applicant will have significant input in the setting of these deadlines, 
large slippage may cause that project to fail to meet the designated 
criterion for acceptance. Even under these circumstances a second 
opportunity to succeed will be provided to the applicant.
