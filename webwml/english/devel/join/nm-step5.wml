<H2>Step 5: Evaluation and Check-in</H2>
<P>
When <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>
has completed the performance tests, expressed an understanding of 
<A HREF="../../social_contract">"The Social Contract"</A>,
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">"The Debian Free Software Guidelines"</A>
and Debian policies and procedures, and been properly identified, 
it is time for <A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A> 
to make 
<A HREF="./nm-amchecklist#finalreport">a final report</A>
to <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A>.
</P>
<P>
This report should include the completed identification information, 
a sample of the discussions about the Social Contract and the DFSG, 
and details of the performance testing.
</P>
<P>
This report should include packages delivered, which documentation was written 
or updated, the QA work completed, or whatever task the applicant and manager 
have determined will adequately test the performance of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager</A> will include 
a recommendation for either acceptance of the applicant, or rejection. 
This recommendation should come with specific reasons for the acceptance 
or rejection of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager</A> will deliver 
the report to <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">the NM-Committee</A> for assessment,
and then the same report with the additional documents should be sent to
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the FrontDesk</A> and
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the DA Manager</A>.
</P>
<P>
For details on the additional documents in final report for
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the FrontDesk</A> and
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the DA Manager</A>,
please refer <A HREF="./nm-amchecklist#finalreport">the Final report</A>
section in <A HREF="./nm-amchecklist">Note for Application Managers</A> page.
</P>

<H3>A. Evaluation</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">The NM-Committee</A> now has 
the responsibility to determine from the Manager's report 
whether or not all the requirements have been met. 
This is simply a check of the report to verify that all the required criterion 
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">The NM-Committee</A> may make recommendations 
or requests for additional information or some other demonstration of skill 
if the report does not seem complete.
</P>
<P>
Only if any of the critical items can not be completed by the applicant, 
will the application be rejected. These include:
<UL>
    <LI>Failure to provide adequate identification.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to agree to our principles and procedures.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to deliver mutually agreed upon projects.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
While deadlines are important, some extension of deadlines is certainly 
reasonable.  However, considering that the applicant has considerable input 
into the creation of the schedule, long delays increase the likelihood of
the application being put on hold.  When a project fails to be delivered, 
or the time for delivery was determined to be too long, the applicant will
be given one additional opportunity to succeed at a similar task.
</P>

<H3>B. Check-in</H3>
<P>
The <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">Developer Accounts Manager (DAM)</A> receives
the report of the applicant from his Application Manager.  If the Developer
Accounts Manager needs more information, they might contact the applicant by
phone or ask the AM to send them more information about the applicant.
</P>

<P>
When <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the Developer Accounts Managers</A> 
are satisfied that the application is complete, they will create 
the necessary accounts in the applicant's name and subscribe 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> to 
the requisite mailing lists.
</P>

<P>
Once all the final details of membership have been completed by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the Developer Accounts (DA) Managers</A>, 
the applicant and the rest of the NM-Committee will be notified 
and the applicant will be welcomed aboard.
</P>
