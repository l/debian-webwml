<H2>Step 5: Identity Validation</H2>
<P>
The Application Manager (AM) will follow the 
<A HREF="./nm-amchecklist">AM Checklist for Identification</A>
and process the identification documentation to verify the identity of
the applicant.
</P>
<P>
This process does not obstruct the remaining steps in the application,
and can be done in parallel with the other activities in the process.
The remaining steps can continue without the completion of this step.
Hoever, the application will not be complete until the identity of
the applicant has been verified.
