<H2>Step 5: Evaluation and Check-in</H2>
<P>
When <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>
has completed the performance tests, expressed an understanding of 
<A HREF="../../social_contract">"The Social Contract"</A>,
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">"The Debian Free Software Guidelines"</A>
and Debian policies and procedures, and been properly identified, 
it is time for <A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A> 
to make a final report to <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A>.
</P>
<P>
This report should include the completed identification information, 
a sample of the discussions about the Social Contract and the DFSG, 
and details of the performance testing.
</P>
<P>
This report should include packages delivered, which documentation was written 
or updated, the QA work completed, or whatever task the applicant and manager 
have determined will adequately test the performance of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager</A> will include 
a recommendation for either acceptance of the applicant, or their rejection. 
This recommendation should come with specific reasons for the rejection 
or acceptance of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager</A> will deliver 
the report to <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A> for assessment. 
</P>
<P>
All submitted electronic identification documents will be sent to the Front
Desk for archival.
</P>

<H3>A. Evaluation</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A> now has 
the responsibility to determine from the Manager's report 
whether or not all the requirements have been met. 
This is simply a check of the report to verify that all the required criterion 
have been completed.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A> may make recommendations 
or requests for additional information or some other demonstration of skill 
if the report does not seem complete.
</P>
<P>
Only if any of the critical items can not be completed by the applicant, 
will the application be rejected. These include:
<UL>
    <LI>Failure to provide adequate identification.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to agree to our principles and procedures.</LI>
    <LI>Failure to deliver mutually agreed upon projects.</LI>
</UL>
</P>    
<P>
While deadlines are important, some extension of deadlines is certainly 
reasonable. However, considering that the applicant has considerable input 
into the creation of the schedule, long delays increase the likelihood of
the application being rejected. When a project fails to be delivered, or the
time for delivery was determined to be too long, the applicant will be given
one additional opportunity to succeed at a similar task.
</P>

<H3>B. Check-in</H3>
<P>
Once <A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">the Committee</A> has made its 
determination, the success or failure of the application will be 
communicated to the <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A>.
If the applicant has been determined to have failed to complete 
the application, the notification of The Committee will include 
those points which must be repaired before the application can be 
successfully completed.
</P>
<P>
If the application has been completed successfully, 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> will be notified 
to contact <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The Developer Accounts Managers</A>
for the final check-in that will complete the application process. 
The Developer Accounts Manager will be previously notified of 
the applicant's success, and will be expecting the applicant's contact attempts.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The Developer Accounts (DA) Managers</A> have 
one job to do before the accounts can be created, and the mailing lists 
subscribed. That is the phone contact with 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The DA Managers</A> will determine 
how this phone contact will be done. The usual method will be 
for the DA Manager to provide a phone number to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>.
which will be used to contact the DA Manager. The applicant can 
then provide a number for a "call back" by the DA Manager.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">The DA Managers</A> may delegate this job 
to a "local manager" at their discretion. 
In either case the DA Managers will determine the scope of 
the conversation with the applicant.
</P>
<P>
This phone conversation should cover the following ideas:
<OL>
     <LI>Does the applicant understand the Social Contract and the DFSG?</LI>
     <LI>Does the applicant understand our policies and procedures?</LI>
     <LI>In addition to understanding, is there a degree of commitment
        to these principles.</LI>
     <LI>Gain a general understanding of the applicant's skills.</LI>
</OL></P>
<P>
When <A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the Developer Accounts Managers</A> 
are satisfied that the application is complete, they will create 
the necessary accounts in the applicant's name and subscribe 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> to 
the requisite mailing lists.
</P>

<P>
Once all the final details of membership have been completed by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DAMan">the Developer Accounts (DA) Managers</A>, 
the applicant and the rest of The Committee will be notified 
and the applicant will be welcomed aboard.
</P>
