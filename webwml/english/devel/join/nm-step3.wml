<H2>Step 3: Submitting Identification Information</H2>
<P>
The preferred form for submitting Supporting Identification Documents is a 
pgp/gpg signed digital image file produced by scanning the desired documents.
This signed digital image will be e-mailed to the address provided by the 
Front Desk. Receipt of this document will complete this step.
</P>
<P>
In the case where a digital scan of these documents is not possible,
a photocopy of the documentation can be mailed to an address provided by
the Front Desk. In addition to the required documentation, this photocopy
must include a copy of the pgp/gpg fingerprint and the physical signature
of the applicant. This option is to be used as a last resort, as it is
much more time consuming. Receipt of this document will complete this step.
