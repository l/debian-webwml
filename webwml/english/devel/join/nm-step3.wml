<H2>Step 3: Philosophy and Procedures</H2>
<P>
<H3>A. Philosophy</H3>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">The applicant</A> is expected 
to agree with the Debian philosophy as expressed in
<A HREF="../../social_contract">"The Social Contract"</A> and
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">"The Debian Free Software Guidelines"</A>. 
This requires that the applicant understand these documents well enough to
express these ideas and ideals in their own words. Just exactly how this
understanding is accomplished and communicated is left up to the applicant
and their manager to determine. The following are only intended as suggested
methods, and are not required, but are examples of ways to resolve this
step of the process. Several opportunities will be provided for the
applicant to show understanding in these areas.
</P>
<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager (AM)</A> 
will decide when the criterion for each step have 
been satisfied. These guidelines only provide useful examples. 
The AM and <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the Applicant</A> 
may decide on other tasks than the ones specified here. 
Those tasks must be documented clearly for the rest of 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">the committee</A>.

<DL>
    <DT>1. <A HREF="../../social_contract">The Social Contract</A></DT>
    <DD><P>
    The Social Contract declares Debian's goals and aspirations. 
    It also tries to express our self-imposed responsibilities to 
    the rest of the community. 
    A proper understanding of the priorities we give to these various
    responsibilities and agreement with them is essential for any
    applicant.</P>
    <P><DL>
    <DT>a. </DT>
       <DD>
       Recorded discussions with the AM about the various "terms" in 
       The Social Contract, expressing an understanding of their proper 
       relationship within the Debian organization, may provide enough
       information about the applicants understanding of these issues.
       </DD>
       
    <DT>b. </DT>
       <DD>
       A recorded discussion about the applicant's personal goals for 
       the project, and how they fit in with The Social Contract, could 
       also provide adequate proof of the applicant's understanding.
      </DD>
    </DL></P>
    </DD>

    <DT>2. <A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">The Debian Free Software Guidelines</A></DT>
    <DD>
    <P>
    Without being a lawyer, each applicant should be able to express an
    understanding of the basic principles set forth in these guidelines.
    While these principles act as guidelines for determining the freedom
    delivered by a particular license, some people have trouble determining 
    whether any given license fits the criterion.
    </P>
    <P><DL>
     <DT>a. </DT>
       <DD>
       The DFSG clearly "calls out" several licenses, other than the GPL
       as free licenses. A discussion between the AM and the applicant
       detailing why the applicant feels these licenses fit the guidelines
       even thought they have "objectionable" clauses. 
       The three freedoms: the freedom to modify, 
       the freedom to distribute those modifications, 
       and the freedom to access and distribute source code;
       are fundamental ones we require of any license
       in order to be considered free.
       An ability to declare a license free,
       from these fundamental principles is a clear indication that the 
       applicant understand these principles.
       </DD>
     <DT>b. </DT>
       <DD>
       A simple description of the principles cited above and their
       importance in securing the freedoms we desire, would also go a long
       way toward identifying the applicants understanding of these
       principles.
       </DD>
   </DL></P>
   </DD>
</P>
       
<P>
What ever method is used, the applicant must express an agreement with these
principles, as well as an understanding of their meaning and content.
</P>

<P>
Failure to agree to these terms will terminate the application process.
</P>

<H3>B. Procedures</H3>

<P>
The Procedures and Policies important to any particular applicant will vary
depending upon the tasks that the applicant is volunteering to provide.
However, every 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">applicant</A> 
will be required to know where the general policy
is recorded, how it is arrived at, as well as how to carry out their
individual responsibilities within the structure of the project.
</P>

<P>
This section is more of a communication of information from 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A> 
to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>. 
This should be done with some "stock" form documents that outline 
the general structure of our policies and procedures.
The form of this document will be maintained by the Application Managers
and will be delivered to and discussed with the applicant to verify that 
they know where to look for information and how to proceed with their jobs.
</P>

<P>
When <A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A> 
considers these questions properly answered, a report of the
details of this discussion will be delivered to
<A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A>.
</P>

<P>
<A HREF="./newmaint#Commitee">The Committee</A> 
will determine when 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> 
has demonstrated both
understanding and acceptance of these terms, by examining the material in the
report delivered by 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the AM</A>. 
The Committee may ask for additional information from the applicant 
before this step can be completed.
</P>
