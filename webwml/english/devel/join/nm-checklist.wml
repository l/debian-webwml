<p>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to future Debian Developers.</p>

<h3>0. Contributing</h3>

Before you decide to apply, you should already be contributing to Debian by
providing packages, translations, documentation, or any other activity. Usually
you are already registered as a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">Debian Maintainer</a>, and have
been uploading your packages for six months.

<p>The current registration process of New Maintainers is divided 
into 4 parts:</p>

<h3>1. Application and Advocation</h3>
<p>Normally, the process is started with an application through the 
<a href="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer Application
web interface</a>.
<br>
After this step, the Applicant is known to the system and the Debian
New Maintainer Front Desk is the primary contact for questions
concerning the Application. The Front Desk manages or supervises
all other steps and will try to help with all upcoming issues.
</p>
 
<p>After the application is submitted to the system, an official Debian
Developer who has worked with the Applicant advocates them. This is
done with a signed email, containing a short text about the Applicant.
Normally, this mail covers topics like the background of the Applicant,
what (s)he has done for Debian and a few bits about future plans.</p>

<p>Then the Front Desk has a look to what the Applicant has already done
in the project. For the NM process to be the most efficient, Applicants
should have already contributed significantly to Debian. This can be done
through packaging, documentation, Quality Assurance, ...</p>

<h3>2. AM checks</h3>
<p>As soon as an Application Manager is available, the Front Desk
assigns one to the Applicant. The Application Manager's task is to
collect the information needed as a foundation for the decision
of the Debian Account Manager. This is divided into 4 parts:</p>

<h4>ID check</h4>
<p>To maintain the strong Web of Trust that connects all Debian
Developers, Applicants need to identify themselves by providing an
OpenPGP key that is signed by at least one official Developer. To
further ensure their identity, signatures by other people (who do not
need to be DDs, but should be well connected in the overall Web of
Trust) are strongly recommended.</p>

<p><a href="./nm-step2">More ...</a></p>

<h4>Philosophy and Procedures checks</h4>
<p>As Debian is known for its strong ethical and philosophical
background, Applicants have to explain their own view about the
topic of Free Software. Debian has also evolved quite complicated
standard procedures to handle the problems of working in a large
group, so Applicants need to show that they know them and are
able to apply them to concrete situations.</p>

<p><a href="./nm-step3">More ...</a></p>

<h4>Tasks and Skills checks</h4>
<p>To ensure the overall quality of the Debian distribution,
Applicants need to show that they know their tasks in the area
they plan to work on (either documentation and internationalisation
or package maintenance).
#We have more areas, I'm sure of that - but I can't remember them now: FIXME
They also have to show their skills by submitting examples of their
work and answering some questions about it.</p>

<p><a href="./nm-step4">More ...</a></p>

<h4>Recommendation</h4>
<p>If the Application Manager is satisfied with the performance
of the Applicant, an Application Report is prepared and submitted
to the Front Desk and Debian Account Managers.</p>

<p><a href="./nm-step5">More ...</a></p>

<h3>3. Front Desk check</h3>
<p>The Application Report is checked by a member of the Debian Front Desk
for formal problems. If these are grave, the report is rejected and
the Application Manager has to correct the issue. If there are only minor
errors, these are reported to the Applicant and Application Manager.</p>

<p><a href="./nm-step6">More ...</a></p>

<h3>4. Debian Account Manager check and Account creation</h3>
<p>At this last stage of the process, the Application Report is judged.
If needed, further checks are either done by the Account Manager or
an Application Manager is asked to carry out a recheck. Sometimes
a Phone Call is required to finish the application.</p>

<p>If all possible problems are resolved, the Debian Account Managers
assign an account to the Applicant and add their OpenPGP key to the
Debian keyring.</p>
