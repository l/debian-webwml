<P>Current registration process of New Maintainers are handled by the <A
HREF="./newmaint#Committee">NM-Committee</A>. Normally, the process is
started with an application through the <A
HREF="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer Application</A>
webpage interface.  Then an existing Debian developer (an <A
HREF="./newmaint#Advocate">Advocate</A>) has to verify the application.
After this an <A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">Application Manager</A> is
assigned for each applicant, to collect the required information for
registration and to form the final report.  Finally, the <A
HREF="./newmaint#DAM">Developer Accounts Managers</A> judge the final
report from the Application Manager, do additional checks such as phone
contact if required, and complete the process by assigning accounts to the
new maintainer.  </P>
