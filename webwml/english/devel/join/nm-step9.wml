<P>
Once The Committee has made its determination, the success or failure of the
application will be communicated to the applicant. If the applicant has been 
determined to have failed to complete the application, the notification of
The Committee will include those points which must be repaired before the
application can be successfully completed.
</P>
<P>
If the application has been completed successfully, the applicant will be
notified to contact the Developer Accounts Managers for the final steps in
completing the application process. The Committee will previously have
notified the Developer Accounts Managers to expect contact from the
applicant.
