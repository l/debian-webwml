#use wml::debian::template title="How You Can Help"

<H1>-- NOTE:This is unofficial private test page --</H1>
<P>Please do not rely on the information in this page.
These are subject to change without notice</P>

<P>The Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed
entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new developers who
have some technical knowledge, an interest in free software, and some free
time. If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</A>
and our
<A HREF="../../social_contract">Social Contract</A>.

<P>A lot of communication in the project happens on our 
<A HREF="../../support#mail_lists">mailing lists</A>. 
Lists you really need to subscribe to include 
debian-devel-announce, and debian-news, as they are both 
low-volume and often contain important information. 
Other interesting lists might be debian-devel, debian-project,
debian-mentors etc, see 
<A HREF="../../MailingLists/subscribe">Mailing List Subscription</A>
page for the complete listing.</P>
 
<P>(For those who wish to reduce the number of mails, there are "-digest"
lists as read-only, digestified versions for some high-traffic lists.
It's worth to know that You can use the
<A HREF="../../Lists-Archives/">Mailing List Archives</A> page 
to read the mails on various lists with your web browsers.)</P>

<P>If you are interested in maintaining packages, then you should look at 
<A HREF="../../doc/prospective-packages.html">"the Work-Needing and Prospective Packages (WNPP)"</A>
list to see what packages need maintainers. Taking over someone else's
package is the best way to start out as a developer as you can learn
from what the previous maintainer has already done.<P>

<P>You should check the
<A HREF="http://qa.debian.org/howto.html">Debian Quality Assurance</A>
page too, and try to provide the patch to solve the problem. 
Testing and Bug fixing is another better way to contribute 
the whole of Debian.

<P>There are tasks other than package maintainance in Debian,
such as documentation, web maintainance, translation (i18n &amp; l10n), 
publicity, legal support.</P>

<P>Finally, if you see an area that you can help with, 
Go to the <A HREF="newmaint">New Maintainers' Corner</A> page.
If you're still in the queue for becoming an official developer, check out
our <A HREF="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/">sponsorship
program</a>. And if you have not read the
<A HREF="../../doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Developer's Reference</A>,
then You may want to do so. It is a useful overview of 
the recommended procedures and the available resources for 
Debian developers.</P>

<P>Besides the many developers, Debian also needs
<A HREF="../../donations">donations</A> of money and use of machines for
development and connectivity. We are still looking for
<A HREF="../mirror">mirrors</A> in some parts of the world.</P>

<P>Even if you don't have time to maintain packages or aren't in a
position to make monetary or equipment donations to Debian, you can
still help out by filing <A HREF="../../Bugs/">bug reports</A> against
packages that have errors in them.
To make it easier to file bugs, we have packages such as 
<A HREF="../../Packages/unstable/utils/bug.html">bug</A> and
<A HREF="../../Packages/unstable/utils/reportbug.html">reportbug</A>
which make filing bug reports very easy.</P>
