#use wml::debian::template title="How You Can Help"

<P>The Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed
entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new developers who
have some technical knowledge, an interest in free software, and some free
time.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</A>
and our
<A HREF="../../social_contract">Social Contract</A>.</P>

<P>A lot of communication in the project happens on our 
<A HREF="../../MailingLists/">mailing lists</A>.
Lists you really need to subscribe to include debian-devel-announce, and
debian-news, as they are both low-volume and often contain important
information. Other interesting lists might be debian-devel, debian-project,
debian-mentors etc, see the
<A HREF="../../MailingLists/subscribe">Mailing List Subscription</A>
page for the complete listing.</P>
 
<P>(For those who wish to reduce the number of mails, there are "-digest"
lists as read-only, digestified versions for some high-traffic lists.
It's worth to know that you can use the
<A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/">Mailing List Archives</A> page 
to read the mails on various lists with your web browsers.)</P>

<P>If you are interested in maintaining packages, then you should look at
our <A HREF="../wnpp/">Work-Needing and Prospective Packages</A> list to see
what packages need maintainers. Taking over someone else's package is the
best way to start out as a developer as you can learn from what the previous
maintainer has already done.</P>

<P>There are several things, other than package maintenance, you can
contribute to in Debian. Testing and reporting/fixing bugs is great help to
us, along with helping in writing good documentation, or doing web
maintenance, translation (i18n &amp; l10n), publicity, legal support...
our <A HREF="http://qa.debian.org/howto.html">quality assurance</A> web page
lists several possible ways to help.</P>

<P>Besides the many developers, Debian also needs
<A HREF="../../donations">donations</A> of money and use of machines for
development and connectivity. We are still looking for
<A HREF="../../mirror/">mirrors</A> in some parts of the world.</P>

<P>Finally, if you see an area that you can help with, and it involves being
a registered developer, go to the <A HREF="newmaint">New Maintainers' Corner</A>
page, to find out how to apply for official developer status. Please read the
<A HREF="../../doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Developer's
Reference</A>, it's a useful overview of the recommended procedures and the
available resources for Debian developers.</P>

<P>Note: if you're still in the queue for becoming an official developer,
check out our <A HREF="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/">
sponsorship program</a>.</P>
