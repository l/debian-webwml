#use wml::debian::template title="How You Can Help"

<P>The Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed
entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new developers who
have some technical knowledge, an interest in free software, and some free
time.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<A HREF="../../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</A>
and our
<A HREF="../../social_contract">Social Contract</A>.</P>

<P>A lot of communication in the project happens on our 
<A HREF="../../MailingLists/">mailing lists</A>.
Some of the lists to which you really should subscribe are debian-devel-announce
and debian-news. Those lists are both low-volume and often contain important
information. Other interesting lists are debian-devel, debian-project,
debian-mentors, and others. See the
<a href="../../MailingLists/subscribe">Mailing List Subscription</a> page for a
complete listing.</p>
 
<P>(For those who wish to reduce the number of mails, there are "-digest"
lists as read-only, digestified versions for some high-traffic lists.
It's worth to know that you can use the
<A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/">Mailing List Archives</A> page 
to read the mails on various lists with your web browsers.)</P>

<P>If you are interested in maintaining packages, then you should look at
our <A HREF="../wnpp/">Work-Needing and Prospective Packages</A> list to see
what packages need maintainers. Taking over an abandoned package is the
best way to start out as a developer - not only does it aid Debian in keeping
its packages well maintained, but it gives you the opportunity to learn from
the previous maintainer.</p>

<p>Aside from package maintenance, you can contribute to Debian in a variety
of ways. Testing packages, as well as reporting and fixing bugs, is a great
help to us. You can also aid by writing good
<a href="$(HOME)/doc/">documentation</a>, or doing
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/">web site maintenance</a>.
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/">Translation</a> (i18n &amp; l10n), publicity,
legal support... our <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">Quality
Assurance</a> site lists several other possibilities.

<P>Besides the many developers, Debian also needs
<A HREF="../../donations">donations</A> of money and use of machines for
development and connectivity. We are still looking for
<A HREF="../../mirror/">mirrors</A> in some parts of the world.</P>

<P>Finally, if you see an area that you can help with, and it involves being
a registered developer, go to the <A HREF="newmaint">New Maintainers' Corner</A>
page, to find out how to apply for official developer status. Please read the
<A HREF="../../doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/">Developer's
Reference</A>, it's a useful overview of the recommended procedures and the
available resources for Debian developers.</P>

<P>Note: if you're still in the queue for becoming an official developer,
check out our <A HREF="http://www.internatif.org/bortzmeyer/debian/sponsor/">
sponsorship program</a>.</P>
