#use wml::debian::template title="How You Can Join"

<p>The Debian Project consists of volunteers, and our products are developed
entirely by volunteers. We are generally looking for new developers who
have some technical knowledge, an interest in free software, and some free
time.</p>

<p>If you haven't already, you should read through most of the web pages
to get a better understanding of what we are trying to do.
Pay particular attention to the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>
and our
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>.</p>

<p>A lot of communication in the project happens on our 
<a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/">mailing lists</a>.
If you want to get a feeling for the inner workings of the Debian project,
you should at least subscribe to the debian-devel-announce and debian-news
lists. Both are very low-volume and document what's going on in the
community. The Debian Project News (published on debian-news) summarizes
recent discussions from Debian related maillists and blogs and provides
links to them.
As a prospective developer, you should also subscribe to debian-mentors,
an open forum trying to help New Maintainers (and also, though less often,
people who are new to the Project and want to help with something else
than package maintenance).
Other interesting lists are debian-devel, debian-project, debian-release,
debian-qa and, depending on your interests, a lot of others. See the
<a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">Mailing List Subscription</a> page
for a complete listing.
(For those who wish to reduce the number of mails, there are "-digest"
lists as read-only, digestified versions for some high-traffic lists.
It's also worth knowing that you can use the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">Mailing List Archives</a> page 
to read the mails on various lists with your web browsers.)</p>

<p><b>Contributing.</b>
If you are interested in maintaining packages, then you should look at
our <a href="$(DEVEL)/wnpp/">Work-Needing and Prospective Packages</a> list to see
which packages need maintainers. Taking over an abandoned package is the
best way to start out as a maintainer &ndash; not only does it aid
Debian in keeping its packages well maintained, but it gives you the
opportunity to learn from the previous maintainer.</p>

<p>You can also aid by contributing to the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/">writing
of documentation</a>, doing <a href="$(HOME)/devel/website/">web site
maintenance</a>, <a href="$(HOME)/intl/">translation</a> (i18n &amp; 
l10n), publicity, legal support or other roles in the Debian community.
Our <a href="http://qa.debian.org/">Quality Assurance</a> site lists several
other possibilities.
</p>

<p>You don't need to be an official Debian Developer to carry out just 
 about all of these tasks. Existing Debian Developers acting as 
 <a href="newmaint#Sponsor">sponsors</a> can integrate your work into the 
 project. It is generally best to try and find a developer who is working
 in the same area as you and has an interest in what you have done.</p>

<p>Finally, Debian provides many <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Teams">teams</a> of developers working
together on common tasks. Anybody can participate on a team, whether
an official Debian Developer or not. Working together with a team is
an excellent way to gain experience before starting the <a
href="newmaint">New Maintainer Process</a> and is one of the best
places to find package sponsors. So find a team that suits your
interests and jump right in.
</p>

<p>
<b>Joining.</b>
After you have contributed for some time and are sure about your involvement
in the Debian project, you can join Debian in a more official role. There
are two different roles in which you might join Debian:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Debian Maintainer (DM): The first step in which you can upload packages to
the Debian archive yourself some Debian Developer has previously sponsored for
you.</li>
<li>Debian Developer (DD): The traditional full membership role in Debian. A DD
can upload any package and can participate in Debian elections. Before applying
as DD, you should have been a DM for about six months.</li>
</ul>

<p>In spite of the fact that many of the rights and responsibilities
of a DM and a DD are identical, there are currently independent
processes for applying for either role. See the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">Debian Maintainer wiki
page</a> for details on becoming a Debian Maintainer. And see the <a
href="newmaint">New Maintainers' Corner</a> page to find out how to
apply for official Debian Developer status.</p>

<p>Note that during much of Debian's history, the Debian Developer
role was the only role; the Debian Maintainer role was introduced on
5th August 2007. This is why you see the term "maintainer" used in a
historical sense where the term Debian Developer would be more
precise. For example, the process of applying to become a Debian
Developer is still known as the "Debian New Maintainer" process.</p>

<p>Regardless of which role you choose to apply for, you should be
familiar with Debian's procedures, so it is recommended to read the <a
href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a> and the <a
href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/">Developer's
Reference</a> before applying.</p>

<p>Besides the many developers, there's many areas you
<a href="$(HOME)/intro/help">can help Debian</a> with, including testing,
documentation, porting, <a href="$(HOME)/donations">donations</a> of money and
use of machines for development and connectivity. We are constantly looking for
<a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">mirrors</a> in some parts of the world.</p>
