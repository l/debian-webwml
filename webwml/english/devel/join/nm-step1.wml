be of interest to Debian developers in future.</P>

<H2>Step 1: Initial Contact</H2>
<P>
Anyone desiring to become involved with the Debian Project, either as
a package maintainer, or in some other capacity, may submit their intention
to The New Maintainer Team, by sending an e-mail to:
<address>new-maintainer@debian.org</address>
</P>

<P>
They can also enter using the 
<A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer Application</A>
web page.  This is much faster than the e-mail approach, as it automaticly 
enters the applicant into the new-maintainer database.</P>

<P>
Please include the areas you would be interested in working on,
and provide an e-mail address that can be used to handle all
further contact.</P>

<P>
When sending e-mail to the new-maintainer address, always include
the phrase [new-application] in the subject line.</P>

<P>
Upon receiving this application notice, 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>
will assign someone as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>
for
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A>
as soon as someone becomes available to help.
Unless communications fail, all other communication will be 
between the applicant and their Application Manager (AM).
</P>
