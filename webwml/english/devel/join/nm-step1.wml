<P>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to future Debian developers.</P>

<H2>Step 1: Initial Contact</H2>
<P>
Anyone can apply to become actively involved with the Debian Project, either
as a package maintainer or some other way. Send e-mail explaining your
intentions to the New Maintainer Team at
<address>new-maintainer@debian.org</address>.
</P>

<P>
They can also enter using the 
<A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer Application</A>
web page.  This is much faster than the e-mail approach, as it automatically 
enters the applicant into the new-maintainer database.</P>

<P>
Please include the areas you would be interested in working on in your
application, and provide an e-mail address that can be used to handle all
further contact.</P>

<P>
When sending e-mail to the new-maintainer address, always include
the phrase [new-application] in the subject line.</P>

<P>
Upon receiving the notice of application, 
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>
will assign someone as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A>
for
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> (i.e. you)
as soon as someone becomes available to help.
All further communication will happen between the applicant and their
Application Manager, unless of course any problems occur.
</P>
