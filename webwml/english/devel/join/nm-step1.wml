be of interest to future Debian developers.</P>

<H2>Step 1: Initial Contact</H2>
<P>
Anyone can apply to become actively involved with the Debian Project, either
as a package maintainer or some other way.  You can
<A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">apply</A> on the New Maintainer
(NM) pages.  In order to apply, <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the
applicant</A> must have done some preparations already.  You need:

<UL>
<LI>an existing developer who thinks that the applicant has sufficient
knowledge to start the New Maintainer process.  This
developer (called an <A HREF="./newmaint#Advocate">Advocate</A>) can be
found by getting involved in Debian development -- by helping tackle some
of the many open bugs against existing packages, or doing QA work, or
adopting an orphaned package, or working on the installer, or perhaps by
packaging useful software or providing useful and significant
documentation that's not yet part of Debian.  Creating new packages is
an easy way to demonstrate that one has many of the skills required to
be a Debian developer (DD), but more is demanded of DDs than just raw
skill.
<LI>After signing up on NM pages, the advocate has to
fill out a web form and thereby verify the applicant's application (More
information about the Advocate system can be found in the
<A HREF="./nm-advocate">guidelines for advocates</A>).
<LI>a way to <A HREF = "./nm-step2">identify</A> himself (preferably by
having a GPG key signed by an existing Debian Developer or, alternatively,
by sending in a photo of his drivers license or passport signed digitally
with his GPG key).
<LI>enough experience in order to become an official Debian Developer
(the preferred way is to have a package
<A HREF ="./newmaint#Sponsor">sponsored</A> by a Debian developer; of course,
involvement in other free software projects counts as well).
</UL>

<P>
Upon receiving the notice of application,
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>
will assign someone as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A>
for
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> (i.e. you)
as soon as someone becomes available to help.
All further communication will happen between the applicant and their
Application Manager, unless of course any problems occur.
</P>
