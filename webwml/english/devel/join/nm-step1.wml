<H2>Step 1: Initial Contact</H2>
<P>
Anyone can apply to become actively involved with the Debian Project, either
as a package maintainer or some other way.  You can
<A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">apply</A> on the NM pages.  In
order to apply, <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> must
have done some preparations already.  You need:

<UL>
<LI>an existing developer who thinks that the applicant has sufficient
knowledge to start the New Maintainer process.  After signing up, this
developer (called an <A HREF="./newmaint#Advocate">Advocate</A>) has to
fill out a web form and thereby verify the applicant's application (More
information about the Advocate system can be found in the
<A HREF="./nm-advocate">guidelines for advocates</A>).
<LI>a way to <A HREF = "./nm-step2">identify</A> himself (preferably by
having a GPG key signed by an existing Debian Developer or, alternatively,
by sending in a photo of his drivers license or passport signed digitally
with his GPG key)
<LI>enough experience in order to become an official Debian Developer
(the preferred way is to have a package
<A HREF =./newmaint#Sponsor">sponsored</A> by a Debian developer; of course,
involvement in other free software projects counts as well).
</UL>

<P>
Upon receiving the notice of application,
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>
will assign someone as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A>
for
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> (i.e. you)
as soon as someone becomes available to help.
All further communication will happen between the applicant and their
Application Manager, unless of course any problems occur.
</P>
