<p>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to future Debian developers.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Application</h2>

<p>Before applying, prospective New Maintainers should check that they are
prepared for all parts of the checks. To make this as easy as possible,
the most important prerequisites are listed below:</p>

<ul>
 <li><h4>The Applicant needs to agree with Debian's Philosophy</h4>
  <p>It is needed that Applicants have read the 
   <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a> and the 
   <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software 
   Guidelines</a> and agree to abide by them in their Debian-related work.
  </p>
 </li>

 <li><h4>The Applicant's identity needs to be verified</h4>
  <p>This is usually done by having at least one signature on the Applicant's
   OpenPGP key from a Debian Developer. It is also strongly recommended to have
   more signatures from people who are well connected in the web of trust.
  </p>

  <p>If the Applicant's location makes it <em>impossible</em> to get a key
   signed by another Debian Developer, a scanned photo of their drivers license
   or passport signed with their GPG key can be accepted as an alternative
   method of identification.
  </p>
 </li>

 <li><h4>The Applicant needs to be able to perform their duties as a 
  developer</h4>
  <p>This means that the Applicant should have experience of packaging and
   package maintenance or experience of documenting or translating, depending
   on the area they want to work in.
  </p>
  
  <p>It's recommended that Applicants get a <a href="newmaint#Sponsor">sponsor</a>
  to help them achieve this.</p>
 </li>

 <li><h4>The Applicant needs to have read the developer documentation</h4>
  <p>Later on in the process, the <a href="newmaint#AppMan">Application
   Manager</a> will test the Applicant's knowledge of concepts described in
   <a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>,
   <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/">Developers' Reference</a>,
   <a href="$(DOC)/maint-guide/">New Maintainers' Guide</a> etc.
  </p>
 </li>

 <li><h4>The Applicant needs to have enough free time</h4>
  <p>Finishing the New Maintainer Checks and being a Debian Developer
   requires to invest time on a regular basis. Maintaining packages
   in the main archive is a big commitment and can require quite
   a lot of time.</p>
 </li>

 <li><h4>The Applicant needs to have an <a href="newmaint#Advocate">\
  Advocate</a></h4>
  <p>In order to persuade a developer to be your advocate, an Applicant should
   get involved in Debian development &ndash; help tackle open bugs
   against existing packages, adopt an orphaned package, work on the
   installer, package useful new software, write or update documentation
   etc.
  </p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the Applicant has satisfied the above standards, they
can submit their <a href="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer
Application</a>.</p>

<p>After receiving the application, the <a href="./newmaint#FrontDesk">
Front Desk</a> manages the application. As soon as someone is available
(this can take some weeks), it will assign them as the <a 
href="./newmaint#AppMan">Application Manager</a> (AM) for the <a
href="./newmaint#Applicant">Applicant</a> (i.e. you).</p>

<p>All further communication should happen between the Applicant and their
Application Manager, but if problems arise, the Front Desk is your primary
contact point.</p>
