<P>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to future Debian developers.</P>

<H2>Step 1: Initial Contact</H2>

<p>These are the prerequisites for becoming an <a href="newmaint#Applicant">\
applicant</a> in the Debian New Maintainer process:</p>

<ul>

<li>The applicant needs to read and understand the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a> and the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> and agree to abide by them in their Debian-related work.

<br>&nbsp;

<li>The applicant's identity needs to be verified.

<p>This is usually done by having at least one signature on the applicant's
GPG key from a Debian Developer. If the applicant's location makes it
impossible to get a key signed by another Debian Developer, a scanned photo
of their drivers license or passport signed with their GPG key can be
accepted as an alternative method of identification.</p>

<li>The applicant needs to be able to perform their duties as a developer.

<p>This means that the applicant should have experience in packaging if they
want to make packages, or experience in coding if they want to code patches,
or experience in documenting if they want to write documents, etc.
It's recommended that the applicants get a
<a href="newmaint#Sponsor">sponsor</a> to help them achieve this.</p>

<li>The applicant needs to have read the documentation on the
<a href="$(DEVEL)/">Developers' Corner</a>.

<p>Later on in the process, the <a href="newmaint#AppMan">application
manager</a> will test the applicant's knowledge of concepts described in
<a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>,
<a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/">Developers' Reference</a>,
<a href="$(DOC)/maint-guide/">New Maintainers' Guide</a> etc.</p>

<li>An existing developer needs to <a href="newmaint#Advocate">advocate</a>
the applicant.

<p>In order to persuade a developer to be your advocate, an applicant should
get involved in Debian development -- help tackle open bugs against existing
packages, adopt an orphaned package, work on the installer, package useful
new software, write or update documentation etc.</p>

</ul>

<p>Once the applicant has satisfied the above standards, they
can submit their <a href="http://nm.debian.org/newnm.php">New Maintainer
Application</a>.</p>

<P>
Upon receiving the notice of application,
<A HREF="./newmaint#FrontDesk">the Front Desk</A>
will assign someone as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A>
for
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> (i.e. you)
as soon as someone becomes available to help.
All further communication will happen between the applicant and their
Application Manager, unless of course any problems occur.
</P>
