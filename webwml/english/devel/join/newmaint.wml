<p>The Debian New Maintainer process is a series of required proceedings to
become a Debian developer. On these web pages, prospective Debian developers
can find all the details of applying, the process details, and how to track
the progress of ongoing applications.</p>

<p>Many people wish to contribute to Debian and first try to become official
developers, even though that's not necessary. In fact, we recommend that
people start contributing as soon as possible, and then later proceed to
make their developer status official.</p>

<p>If you want to maintain one or more packages for Debian, you should
try to find a <a href="#Sponsor">sponsor</a> for them. The 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/">debian-mentors</a>
mailing list is a good starting point. You should
read the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/">list
archives</a> and the 
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~mpalmer/debian-mentors_FAQ.html">list's 
FAQ</a> to familiarize you with the sponsorship system.</p>

<p>It's also possible to contribute to Debian in other ways, such as
<a href="./">donating resources, helping with bug reports, writing and/or
translating documentation and software, etc</a>. Some of these things can
help Debian even more than packaging, and they usually don't require going
through the complex process of becoming an official developer.</p>

     <DD>A sponsor is an existing Debian Developer (see <A HREF =
         "#Member">Member</A>) who acts as the mentor of an Applicant:
         they check packages done by the applicant and help them
         improve the packaging.  When the sponsor is satisfied with
         the package, they upload it on behalf of the applicant to the
         Debian archive. The Applicant is recorded as the maintainer of
         such a package, despite the fact applicants aren't allowed to
         upload packages themselves.

         <p>Applicants can find a sponsor by
         sending an email to <email debian-mentors@lists.debian.org>
         describing their package and asking for a sponsor.
         Developers can find more information on how to be a sponsor
         in the <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/ch-beyond-pkging#s-newmaint">\
