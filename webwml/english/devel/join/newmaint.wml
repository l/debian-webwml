<p>The Debian New Maintainer process is a series of required proceedings to
become a Debian developer. On these web pages, prospective Debian developers
can find all the details of applying, the process details, and how to track
the progress of ongoing applications.</p>

<p>If you want to do something for Debian but without becoming a developer,
there are several other ways <a href="./">in which you can help</a>.

    <DD>An organization of free software developers spread around the world
        with a common goal, to produce a completely free operating system.
        See <a href="$(HOME)/">Debian WWW pages</a> for more information.
    </DD>

  <DT><A name="Member">Member, Developer</A>:</DT>
    <DD>A <a href="#DebianProject">Debian Project</a> member.</DD>

  <DT><A name="Applicant">Applicant</A>:</DT>
    <DD>A person requesting membership in the <a href="#DebianProject">Debian
        Project</a>; prospective Debian developer.</DD>

  <DT><A name="Advocate">Advocate</A>:</DT>
    <DD>An existing Debian developer who recommends an Applicant.
        An Applicant can only go through the NM process after an
        Advocate has verified his application.  The <A HREF =
        "#Sponsor">Sponsor</A> of an Applicant often acts as his
        Advocate once he is satisfied with the Applicant's skills.</DD>

  <DT><A name="Committee">The NM-Committee</A>: <email debian-newmaint@lists.debian.org></DT>
    <DD>The NM-Committee is a body of people who control the New Maintainer
        process. It is composed of the Front Desk, the Application Managers,
        and the Developer Accounts Managers.</DD>

  <DT><A name="FrontDesk">Front Desk</A>: <email new-maintainer@debian.org></DT>
    <DD>This person receives new application requests and passes them to
        appropriate Application Managers.  This is "the contact of last
        resort" when other committee contacts fail to respond.
	<br>
        A person from the NM-Committee is assigned this task.  Currently,
        this is Dale Scheetz with the assistance of Martin Michlmayr.
    </DD>

  <DT><A name="AppMan">Application Manager</A>:</DT>
    <DD>A Debian developer who is assigned to an Applicant in order to
        monitor their progress through the application process.
        <br>
        The number of Application Managers isn't fixed. See the
        <a href="http://nm.debian.org/whoisam.php">list of current
        Application Managers</A>.
	<br>
        One person can be the application manager for several applicants.
    </DD>

  <DT><A name="DAMan">Developer Accounts Managers</A>: <email da-manager@debian.org></DT>
    <DD>These are the people who manage user accounts on Debian machines,
        and finalize the details of membership by assigning accounts to new
        developers. They are delegates appointed by the Debian project
        leader, as described in the <a href="../constitution">Debian
        Constitution</a>.
	<br>
        The current DAM is James Troup.  Martin (Joey) Schulze acts as
        a backup.
    </DD>
   <DT><A name="Sponsor">Sponsor</A>:</DT>
     <DD>A sponsor is an existing Debian Developer (see <A HREF =
         "#Member">Member</A>) who acts as the mentor of an Applicant:
         he checks the package done by the applicant and helps him
         improving the packaging.  When the sponsor is satisfied with
         the package, he uploads it on behalf of the applicant to the
         Debian archive.  The package is called a <I>sponsored package</I>
         which means that the applicant is the official maintainer but
         that a member has uploaded it (since applicants are not allowed
         yet to upload packages themselves).  You can find a sponsor by
         sending an email to <email debian-mentors@lists.debian.org>
         describing your package and asking for a sponsor.
     </DD>
