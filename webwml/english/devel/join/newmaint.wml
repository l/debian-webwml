#use wml::debian::template title="Debian New Maintainers' Corner" BARETITLE="true"

<p>The Debian New Maintainer process, is the process of becoming an official 
Debian Developer (DD). These webpages are the place were prospective Debian
Developers can find all the details on applying to become a DD, the 
different steps of the process, and how to track the process of their ongoing 
application.</p>

<p>(<em>Note:</em> the 'developer' in DD basically means 'someone involved with
improving Debian in some way'. This might mean package maintainer, 
translator, documentation writer, website maintainer, etc)</p>

<p>The first important point to make is that you do <em>not</em> need to be an
official Debian developer in order to help improving Debian. In fact, you should
already have a track record of earlier contributions to Debian before you apply for
the New Maintainer process.</p>

<p><a name="#non-maintainer-contributions"></a>Debian is an open community and
welcomes everyone who wants to use or help improve our distribution. As a
non-developer you can:</p>

<ul> 
  <li>maintain packages through a <a href="#Sponsor">sponsor</a></li>
  <li>create and/or review translations</li>
  <li>create or improve documentation</li>
  <li><a href="../website">help maintain the website</a></li>
  <li>help with handling bugs (by providing patches, filing	good bugs,
	  confirming the existence of the bug, finding ways to	reproduce the
	  problem, ...)</li>
  <li>being an active member of a packaging team (e.g. debian-qt-kde or debian-gnome)</li>
  <li>being an active member of a subproject (e.g. debian-installer, or debian-desktop)</li>
  <li>etc</li> 
</ul>
        
<p>It is important to understand that the New Maintainer process is part of
Debian's Quality Assurance efforts. It is hard to find developers who can spend
enough time on their Debian tasks, so we find it important to checking that
applicants are able to sustain their work, and do it well. Therefor we require
that prospective developers have been actively involved in Debian for some time
already.</p>

<p><a name="#developer-priveleges"></a>Every Debian Developer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is associated with Debian;</li>
  <li>is allowed to vote about issues regarding the whole project;</li>
  <li>can log in on most systems that keep Debian running;</li>
  <li>has upload permissions for <em>all</em> packages;</li>
  <li>has access to the debian-private mailing list.</li>
</ul>	

<p>In other words, becoming a Debian Developer grants you several important
privileges regarding the project's infrastructure. Obviously this requires a
great deal of trust in and commitment by the applicant.</p>

<p>Consequently the whole NM process is very strict and thorough. This is not
meant to discourage people interested in becoming a registered developer, but
it does explain why the New Maintainer process takes so much time.</p>
