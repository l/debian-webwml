<p>The Debian New Maintainer process, is the process of becoming an official 
Debian Developer (DD). These webpages are the place where prospective Debian
Developers can find all the details on applying to become a DD, the 
different steps of the process, and how to track the process of their ongoing 
application.</p>

<p>The first important point to make is that you do <em>not</em> need
to be an official Debian Developer in order to help improving
Debian. In fact, you should already have a track record of earlier
contributions to Debian before you apply for
the New Maintainer process. It is highly recommended that you become
familiar with the role of
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMaintainer">Debian Maintainer</a> and
apply for this role before applying to become a Debian
Developer.</p>

<p><a name="non-maintainer-contributions"></a>Debian is an open community and
welcomes everyone who wants to use or help improve our distribution. As a
non-developer you can:</p>

<ul> 
  <li>maintain packages through a <a href="#Sponsor">sponsor</a></li>
  <li>create and/or review translations</li>
  <li>create or improve documentation</li>
  <li><a href="../website">help maintain the website</a></li>
  <li>help with handling bugs (by providing patches, filing good bugs,
	  confirming the existence of the bug, finding ways to reproduce the
	  problem, ...)</li>
  <li>be an active member of a packaging team (e.g. debian-qt-kde or debian-gnome)</li>
  <li>be an active member of a subproject (e.g. debian-installer or debian-desktop)</li>
  <li>etc</li> 
</ul>

<p>The <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/new-maintainer">Debian
Developer's Reference</a> contains several concrete suggestions on how
to do several of these tasks (in particular, how to find willing
sponsors).</p>

<p>It is important to understand that the New Maintainer process is part of
Debian's Quality Assurance efforts. It is hard to find developers who can spend
enough time on their Debian tasks, so we find it important to checking that
applicants are able to sustain their work, and do it well. Therefore we require
that prospective developers have been actively involved in Debian for some time
already.</p>

<p><a name="developer-priveleges"></a>Every Debian Developer:</p>
<ul>
  <li>is associated with Debian;</li>
  <li>is allowed to vote about issues regarding the whole project;</li>
  <li>can log in on most systems that keep Debian running;</li>
  <li>has upload permissions for <em>all</em> packages;</li>
  <li>has access to the debian-private mailing list.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, becoming a Debian Developer grants you several important
privileges regarding the project's infrastructure. Obviously this requires a
great deal of trust in and commitment by the applicant.</p>

<p>Consequently the whole NM process is very strict and thorough. This is not
meant to discourage people interested in becoming a registered developer, but
it does explain why the New Maintainer process takes so much time.</p>
