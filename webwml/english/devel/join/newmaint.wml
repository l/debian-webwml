<p>The Debian New Maintainer process is a series of required proceedings to
become a Debian Developer. On these web pages, prospective Debian Developers
can find all the details of applying, the process details, and how to track
the progress of ongoing applications.</p>

<p>Many people wish to contribute to Debian, though not all know that you
<em>don't</em> need to be an official developer to do so.
<a href="#Sponsor">Sponsors</a> can integrate work of non-developers and
do so on a frequent basis. Some ways of contributing (translating,
writing documentation and reporting bugs) can be done by everyone and
don't require developer status.</p>

   The Debian design process is open to ensure that the system is of the
   highest quality and that it reflects the needs of the user community.

<p>The Debian Project is an open community and welcomes everyone who wants
to use our distribution or even tries to help us. Nevertheless, appointing
new developers is controlled by a very strict and thorough process: Every
official Debian developer is associated with Debian, is allowed to vote
about issues regarding the whole project, can log in on most systems
that keep Debian running and has upload permissions for <em>all packages</em>.
Giving this kind of access is accompanied by a great deal of trust, as we
heavily depend on our secure infrastructure.
<br />
This is not meant to discourage people interested in becoming a registered
developer, but it is meant to explain why we want people to contribute
before applying and why the New Maintainer checks take so much time.
<br />
It's also important to understand that the New Maintainer process is part
of Debian's Quality Assurance efforts. Prospective developers doing a lot
of good work in a short time haven't shown that they are able to do this
in the long term. Finding developers who don't have enough free time for
their Debian tasks is complicated, so checking that Applicants are able
to sustain their work is important. 
</p>

<p>
To ease the process, it is important to already be familiar with Debian,
so we require that prospective developers have already contributed &ndash; in
the form of translations, documentation, sending patches or package
maintenance.
<br />
Non-Developers can maintain one or more packages for Debian through
a <a href="#Sponsor">sponsor</a>. As sponsors check the packages they
want to upload, common problems are easily noticed and can be corrected
before ending up in the real archive. The sponsoring process also helps
to understand Debian's procedures and is a kind of mentoring program.
