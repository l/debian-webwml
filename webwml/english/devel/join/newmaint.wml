<p>The Debian New Maintainer process is a series of required proceedings to
become a Debian developer. On these web pages, prospective Debian developers
can find all the details of applying, the process details, and how to track
the progress of ongoing applications.</p>

<p>If you want to do something for Debian but without becoming a developer,
there are several other ways <a href="./">in which you can help</a>.
