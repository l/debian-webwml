<P>
The fount of all knowledge is the New Maintainer pages.  Start at
<A HREF="newmaint">http://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint</A> and look around until you
are familiar with the contents.  Your responsibilities as an AM are
described there.</P>
<P>
As an AM, you should get subscribed to the New Maintainer mailing list:
debian-newmaint@lists.debian.org.  Please feel free to ask for
help there; we are a friendly list all trying to get volunteers into
the project!  Note that as this is an archived public list, questions
of a highly personal nature should be asked to the Front Desk
privately.  Also, please do not send anything like photo IDs to this
list.</P>
<P>
The other crucial web page is the database: <A HREF="http://nm.debian.org/">http://nm.debian.org/</A>.
You will have received a login there (and it's not encrypted, so
please don't use a sensitive password); see the bottom of that page.
This database is used to record the progress of your applicants.  You
are also able to specify how many applicants you are willing to
process at once (go to the link at the side "Your profile" to do
so).  If you ever do not have enough time to take on more applicants,
simply change this number to zero.</P>
<P>
The rest of the database pages are fairly self-explanatory.  If you
ever have an applicant who is taking too long to respond or who needs
to wait for a couple of months (vacation or whatever), you can always
put them "on hold" so that you can take on another applicant.  There
is a text field "AM Comments" for noting the reasons for such things,
or for noting any other significant information for the front desk and
DAM to note.</P>

<P>The three email addresses of note are:</P>
<DL>
  <DT>NM list: debian-newmaint@lists.debian.org</DT>
     <DD>This mailing list covers all aspects of the New Maintainer process,
        it is used by the New Maintainer group (Front Desk, Application
        Managers, Debian Account Manager, etc.) and others to discuss
        administrative issues, applicants and the New Maintainer process.
        This mailing list is public and archived so please don't post very
        personal information here.</DD>

  <DT>Front Desk: new-maintainer@debian.org</DT>
     <DD>Where initial applications get sent, and where the final full
     report gets sent.  Any personal questions about individual
     applications which are inappropriate for a public forum should be
     directed here as well.</DD>

  <DT>Debian Account Managers (DAMs): da-manager@debian.org</DT>
     <DD>Where the final report is also sent.  The DAMs are responsible
     for creating the accounts on the Debian machines and adding the
     GPG keys to the keyring.  They also get to make the final
     decision on each application, as the official New Maintainer
     delegates of the Debian Project Leader.  Don't hassle the DAMs,
     they are usually very busy!</DD>

letters, and these are attached below as follows:</P>

Hello *****!

I have just been appointed Application Manager for your Debian
maintainership application.

As a first step, have you checked out the New Maintainer corner of the
website?  Have a look at http://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint,
and especially at the checklist referred to from there.  That's what
we'll have to work through together.

So, if you can start by letting me have the following, we should be
able to progress fairly quickly:
 - GPG key (preferably signed by a current developer or certification
   authority)
 - If your GPG is not signed by a current developer, you will need to
   also provide a piece of GPG-signed digitally photo ID (let me know
   if this is a problem; there are other ways to handle this step, but
   this is the easiest)
 - your preferred account name for the Debian machines
 - the email address you would like to be subscribed to debian-private

Finally, please tell me about about yourself and what you intend to do
for Debian (and how this fits in with The Social Contract).  Also, how
you came to Linux and free software, and why you want to volunteer your
time.

If you have packaged an application for Debian already, please give
me an URL where I can get the sources (the .diff and .orig) and the
package itself (the .deb).

Looking forward to helping you through the process.  The next step is
"Philosophy and Procedures" -- I will ask you a few questions by e-mail
which you have to answer.

<H3><A NAME="ap2">APPENDIX 2: SAMPLE EMAIL ABOUT SKILLS, TASKS AND INTRO TO PHILOSOPHY</A></H3>
<PRE>
"Skills" and "Philosophy".

The next thing we have to figure is whether you yet know enough to
maintain a Debian package, and if not, let me help you!  You've said
what you intend to package; have you attempted to do so yet?  It's
often easiest if you take over an existing package at first: then you
get to see how someone else has done it.  You should also read how the
Bug Tracking System (BTS) works: see /usr/share/doc/debian/bug* or
http://bugs.debian.org/.

A word on mailing lists: there are quite a lot of Debian mailing lists
now and packaging-related packages, and I'd just like to check with
you whether you know about the key ones.  I think all of the packages
are listed as dependencies of task-debian-devel, but you may not be
aware of what you have got.

Packages:
  dpkg-dev   All of the primary tools needed to put a Debian package
             together: dpkg-buildpackage, dpkg-source, etc.
  debhelper  A very useful set of scripts designed to make
             debian/rules files more readable and uniform.
  debian-policy
             Describe the policy relating to packages and details of
             the packaging mechanism.  Cover everything from
             required gcc options to the way the maintainer scripts
             (postinst etc.) work, package sections and priorities,
             etc.  An absolute must-read.  Also useful is the file
             /usr/share/doc/debian-policy/upgrading-checklist.txt,
             which lists changes between versions of policy.
  doc-debian Lots of useful Debian-specific documentation: the
             constitution and DFSG, explanation of the Bug Tracking
             System (BTS), etc.
  maint-guide
             The New Maintainer's Guide to making Debian packages.
  devscripts Lots of useful (and not-so-useful) scripts to help build
             packages.
  developers-reference
             Lots of information on procedures and the like.
  dupload    Automatically upload packages to the archive once they
  or dput    are built.
  fakeroot   Build packages without having to be root.

It's not half as bad as it seems at first, but the long-term
advantages to the maintainer and user of having such detailed
descriptions of package building should be clear ;-)

And as for mailing lists, you do not really need to read lots, but the
most significant ones are probably:

debian-announce: Major public announcements
debian-devel-announce: Major announcements to the developer community

These two lists are must-subscribes.  Everything else is optional.  I
abbreviate 'debian-' to '-' from now on!

-security-announce:
          security updates to stable
-private: you'll be subscribed automatically when your new-maintainer
          application is accepted; sensitive discussions, flamewars
          etc.  You can unsubscribe if you wish.
-devel:   general mailing list for developer issues
-policy:  where possible changes to debian-policy are discussed

There are many others; check the mailing list page on the web site
for details.

The other thing we have to discuss is "philosophy".

Have you read the Debian Social Contract
(/usr/share/doc/debian/social-contract.txt)?  Do you agree to follow
it in your Debian-related work?  We'll ask some more detailed
questions next time around.

</PRE>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="ap3">APPENDIX 3: SAMPLE QUESTIONS ON PHILOSOPHY</A></H3>
<PRE>
Philosophy
----------

We have to check that you understand the Social Contract and the Debian
Free Software Guidelines (DFSG).  Have you read them?  If not, please
do so.  You can find them in /usr/share/doc/debian or on
http://www.debian.org

First, please explain the key points of the Social Contract and the
DFSG _in your own words_ (15-20 lines).

Secondly, a few questions, based on them:

 - Donald Knuth, author of TeX, insists that no-one has the right to
modify the source code of TeX, and that any changes must be made using
"change files" (a sort of patch file).  Is this allowed for a program
for the main section of Debian?

 - What is Debian's (current) approach to non-free software?  Why?  Is
non-free part of the Debian System?

 - Debian was offered a Debian-specific license to package a certain
piece of software (I forget which).  Would we put it in main?

 - Do you know (and can you explain) the difference between free speech
and free beer?  Is Debian mainly about free speech or free beer?

 - The e-mail client pine is in non-free.  Can you tell me the
difference between main, contrib and non-free?  Do you know what's
wrong with Pine's current license in regard to the DFSG? (If you
don't know this, never mind).

 - At http://people.debian.org/~wolfie/mpg123_copyright you can
find the license of mpg123.  Can you tell me why this program
is non-free according to the DFSG?

Do you agree to uphold the Social Contract and the DFSG?

If you are accepted as a Debian developer, you will get accounts
on the Debian machines.  Have you read the Debian Machine Usage
Policies (DMUP) at http://www.debian.org/devel/dmup ?  Do you
accept them?


I'm sure you have read the Debian Developers' Reference at
http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/

 - What are Non-Maintainer Uploads (NMUs) and when would you do an NMU?

 - Tell me 3 different methods to close a bug in the BTS.

 - What would you do if a bug was reported against your package and
   you are not able to fix it yourself?

 - You've just heard about this great program and you would like to package
   it. What would you do?

 - Do you know what 'lintian' is?  Why is it useful?

 - What does version 3.4-2.1 mean? What Debian control file would you
   put this in? (Hint: NMU)

 - You have a package in contrib, why would it have to go there? What could
   you do (in theory at least) to get it into main?

 - If you had a file in your package which usually gets changed by a system
   administrator for local settings, how would you make sure your next
   version of the package doesn't overwrite it?

 - What would you do if you wanted to retire from the project and let
   other developers maintain your packages?
