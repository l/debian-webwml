<h2>Documentation and Infrastructure for Application Managers</h2>

<p>The basic information needed by Application Manager is provided
here, in the <a href="newmaint">New Members Corner</a>. Start
to look around until you're familiar with the process and all 
requirements for Applicants.</p>

<p>There are three important mail addresses for Application Managers:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>The New Member mailing list: <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-newmaint">
  debian-newmaint@lists.debian.org</a></dt>
  <dd>This mailing list covers all aspects of the New Member process
   and is used by the New Member group (Front Desk, Application
   Managers, Debian Account Manager) and others to discuss 
   administrative issues and the New Member process.
   If you have any questions regarding the NM process, you can ask
   for help there. Please note that the list is archived publicly, so
   questions of a highly personal nature shouldn't be discussed there.
   Instead, you can ask the Front Desk privately.</dd>

 <dt>New Member Front Desk: nm@debian.org</dt>
  <dd>This is where the initial applications, advocation messages and final
   application reports get sent. Any personal questions about individual
   applications which are inappropriate for a public forum should be
   directed here as well.</dd>

 <dt>Debian Account Managers (DAMs): da-manager@debian.org</dt>
  <dd>Normally, this address is only important to submit the final
   application report. The DAMs are responsible for creating new accounts
   on the Debian machines and adding New Members' OpenPGP keys to
   the keyring. They also get to make the final decision on each 
   application, as the official New Member delegates of the Debian
   Project Leader.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The coordination of the NM process happens on <url
"https://nm.debian.org/"/>, where a website provides an interface to a
database containing all important information about NM applications.
Applicants can use the site to track their application status and 
Application Managers can use it to organize their work.</p>

<p>As Application Manager, you can log in over a secure https connection,
but please note that the password used on nm.debian.org is <em>not</em> the
one used for your normal Debian account (unless you change them to
match, but that's your business). You can record what you have done
with an Applicant and how many applicants you want to process at the
same time.</p>

<p>To put someone on hold, you need to go to the applicant's status
page after you logged in and mark the "No" radio button for "AM approves
and submits report". You should also put a line into the AM comment field
to document why you did this.</p>

<p>The rest of the pages is fairly self-explanatory. Some statistics
about all Application Managers are available, you can see an unsorted
list of all Applicants and change your AM profile.</p>

<h2>Notes about the NM checks</h2>

<p>As the NM-oriented documentation already provides enough information
about the requirements of the checks, nothing of that will be repeated
here. If you're unsure how to manage an applicant, use the excellent
templates provided by Joerg Jaspert's <a 
href="http://anonscm.debian.org/viewvc/nm/trunk/nm-templates/">nm-templates</a>
project. Questions should be asked on debian-newmaint@l.d.o or sent
to the Front Desk.</p>

<h3>Putting an application on hold</h3>

<p>Applicants that are either not able or not willing to invest enough 
time into the New Member checks to finish them in a reasonable time
span (&sim; 6 to 9 months) should be put on hold. That's not a problem or an
assessment of the Applicant's skills, but a simple reaction to the lack
of time. Many people want to join Debian, so Applicants shouldn't block
AM spots.</p>

<p>You should discuss the possibility of setting an application on hold
when you get the feeling that it isn't moving forward, either because
the Applicant doesn't answer or because their only answer is "Yeah, will
do it soon". Emphasize the fact that getting off hold when they have
more time is no problem.</p>

<h3>Other important notes</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Applicants should provide a short biography which can be sent to
  debian-project@lists.debian.org in the regular "New Members"
  email. That's very useful to introduce new members to the project.
  Please note that the Applicant <em>has</em> to agree to the
  publishing of this biography.</li>

 <li>Get some background information about the Applicant and put it
  into the report &mdash; use your favourite search engine, private mail
  archives, the BTS and all other means that come to your mind. 
  Sometimes the application process is too short to get a proper 
  impression of the Applicant's personality, so try to find out what
  they did in the past.</li>

 <li>Ask sponsors and other people who worked closely together with
  the Applicant to provide short statements about them. As more and
  more packages are team-maintained, you can almost always find someone
  who's able to tell you more about an Applicant. Include these
  statements in the report.</li>

 <li>When checking the performance of a packaging Applicant, you should
  be aware that one tiny package in the archive is not enough to
  satisfy the Skills part of the T&amp;S checks. The package should
  have had more than one upload, some users (check popcon) and some
  (closed, if possible) bug reports. This is important to see how an
  Applicant interacts with users.</li>
</ul>
