<h2>Step 4: Tasks and Skills</h2>

<p>Most of the current members of the <a href="./newmaint#DebianProject">
Debian Project</a> maintain one or more packages for the distribution. 
However there are many other jobs that need to be done that do not 
involve package management.</p>

<p>The <a href="./newmaint#AppMan">Application Manager</a> will
work out with the <a href="./newmaint#Applicant">Applicant</a>
which tasks the Applicant volunteers to perform. After that, the
Applicant will need to demonstrate his skills in this area.</p>

<p>The following tasks are obvious examples of the various jobs available
to the Applicant, but they don't necessarily include everything an 
Applicant may find interesting and productive for the group. Additional
tasks may be defined by the AM and the Applicant.</p>

<p>Some example tasks are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><h4>Package Management</h4>
  By maintaining a package, a prospective Developer can show his
  understanding of the <a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/">Debian Policy</a>
  and how he works with Debian users and bug submitters.
 </li>

 <li><h4>Documentation</h4>
  The Applicant can demonstrate his skills in this area by writing
  man pages for executables that don't have one, by updating an outdated
  document and by creating new documentation that is required by
  users, but still missing from the distribution.
 </li>

 <li><h4>Debugging, Testing and Patching</h4>
  The Applicant can show skills in this area either by working on
  fixing bugs with the QA team, or by testing installation process or
  individual packages working with the testing team.  The Applicant
  can fix bugs in existing Debian packages or file bug reports in
  the Debian BTS describing problems and enclosing patches.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>Alternative demonstration tasks can be worked out between the
Applicant and the Application Manager. Such alternative tasks need to
be coordinated with the <a href="./newmaint#FrontDesk">Front Desk</a>
and the <a href="./newmaint#DAM">Debian Account Manager</a>.</p>
