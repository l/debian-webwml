<H2>Step 4: Application Manager Assignment</H2>
<P>
Once the identification docuements have been recieved, the Front Desk will 
assign an Application Manager to the applicant, and deliver the docuementation 
to the manager for authentication.
</P>
<P>
The Application Manager (AM) will notify the applicant of the assignment,
and mark this step complete. The AM will begin the work of verifying
the ID information provided by the applicant, and will start the applicant
on the remaining steps to complete the application.
</P>
<P>
At this point the Front Desk will continue to help in
the ID verification process, but the remainder of the process
will be directed by the Application Manager, with periodic reports
to the web page interface to track the applicant's progress.
