<H2>Step 4: Tasks and Skills</H2>

<H3>A. Tasks</H3>
<P>
Most of the current membership in 
<A HREF="./newmaint#DebianProject">the Debian Project</A>
maintain one or more packages for the distribution. 
However there are many other jobs that need to be done 
that do not involve package management. 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">The Application Manager</A> will 
work out with <A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> 
just which tasks the applicant wishes to volunteer to perform. 
The following tasks are obvious examples of the various jobs 
available to the applicant, but they don't necessarily include everything an applicant
may find interesting and productive for the group. Additional tasks may be
defined by the AM and the applicant, but must be presented to 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">The NM-Committee</A> for approval.
</P>
<P>
The example tasks are:</P>
<UL>
    <LI>Package Management</LI>
    <LI>Documentation</LI>
    <LI>Debugging and Testing</LI>
    <LI>Infrastructure</LI>
</UL>

<H3>B. Skills</H3>
<P>
What is required of the applicant will depend on what task is to be done.
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">The applicant</A> must provide assurance 
that they can, in fact, do the job for which they have volunteered. 
The following are examples only, and can be modified as 
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager (AM)</A> and 
the applicant see fit, so long as the required skills are demonstrated.
</P>
<DL>
     <DT>A. Package Management:</DT>
     <DD><P>
     If the applicant intends to maintain packages for Debian, some
     demonstration of those skills will be required. The first choice is
     to have the applicant take over one of the "orphaned" packages, but
     any other useful package would qualify as well.</P></DD>
     
     <DT>B. Documentation:</DT>
     <DD><P>
     The applicant may demonstrate skills in this area by producing a man
     page for a package that doesn't have one; by editing an outdated document
     to bring it up-to-date; or by producing other documentation required
     but missing from the distribution.</P></DD>
     
     <DT>C. Debugging and Testing</DT>
     <DD><P>
     The applicant will demonstrate skills in this area either by working
     on fixing bugs with the QA team, or by testing installation process or
     individual packages working with the testing team.  The applicant
     can fix bugs in existing Debian packages and file a bug report in
     the Debian BTS describing the problem and enclosing the patch.  Or
     they can fix a bug which has already been filed and send a patch to
     the BTS.</P></DD>
     
     <DT>D. Infrastructure:</DT>
     <DD><P>
     Applying for these jobs is more complex than applying for any of the
     others, because it will require cooperation from the current members
     doing the job that the applicant wishes to help with. Some skill
     testing will be worked out between the current team, the Application
     Manager, and the applicant.</P></DD>
</DL>
<P>     
Alternative demonstration tasks can be worked out between 
<A HREF="./newmaint#Applicant">the applicant</A> and
<A HREF="./newmaint#AppMan">the Application Manager</A>. 
Such alternative tasks will require the permission of the
rest of <A HREF="./newmaint#Committee">The NM-Committee</A>.
