#use wml::debian::template title="The Qualifications Checklist"

<H1>-- NOTE:This is unofficial private test page --</H1>
<P>Please do not rely on the information in this page.
These are subject to change without notice.</P>

<P>The information on this page, while public, will primarily
be of interest to Debian developers in future.</P>

<H2>Step 6: The Qualifications Checklist</H2>
<P>
There are three general areas of qualification that the applicant is 
responsible for: Understanding and agreeing to the Debian Free Software
Guidelines, and the Social Contract; A general understanding of the
Policy documents, and how to apply them; A practical demonstration of
skills required for the work the applicant proposes to do for Debian.
</P>

<P>
In each of these areas several opportunities will be provided for the
applicant to choose from. The Application Manager will decide when the
criterion for each step has been satisfied. These guidelines only provide
useful examples. The AM and the Applicant may decide on other tasks than
the ones specified here, but those tasks must be documented clearly for
the rest of the committee.
</P>

<H3>1. The DFSG and the Social Contract</H3>

<P>
The desire here is to be assured by the applicant that their understanding
of the DFSG and the Social Contract are accurate and complete. In addition
there must be agreement that the applicant will abide by this philosophy.
</P>

<DL>
    <DT>A. Analyze a license:</DT>
    
    <DD>Provide a license (i.e. The Artistic License), and ask several questions
    about that license, like: What clause in the license might be considered
    a restriction on distribution freedoms. (the no-pay clause); and why is
    this clause still acceptable under the DFSG (loophole for costs).</DD>
    
    <DT>B. Explain Social Contract:</DT>
    
    <DD>Ask for a description of the reasoning behind Debian's support of 
    non-free for our users. Get a clear picture from the applicant that there
    is understanding of the key points in the contract.</DD>
</DL>

<H3>2. Debian Policy and Procedures</H3>

<P>
This step is intended to establish the applicant's understanding of current
Debian Policy and the procedures for keeping up with that policy.
</P>

<DL>
     <DT>A. Awareness of Policy:</DT>
     
     <DD>The applicant should be able to express the Policy that applies to
     the task they intend to perform for Debian. They should know the location
     of the policy statements, the mailing lists that are used to govern this
     policy.</DD>
     
     <DT>B. Procedures:</DT>
     
     <DD>Communicate to the applicant information about mailing lists, and how to
     subscribe. Make it clear to the applicant the etiquette for posting to 
     these lists, and the type of discussion that goes on there. Include a
     detailed discussion of the applicants responsibilities with respect to
     their chosen volunteer task within Debian.</DD>
</DL>

<P>     
There should be a great deal of flexibility in the way that this information
is acquired from the applicant. Specially in the case of an applicant with 
limited English skills. For those competent to write an Essay, that form of
delivery is acceptable, but for those who are not fluent enough to take on
this job, a series of e-mail questions and answers can be collected together
to provide an alternative form of delivery. Whatever the form, the
"document" produced will be kept on "record" for the duration of the 
application process, and delivered as part of the final acceptance 
procedure.
</P>
     
<H3>3. Practical Demonstration</H3>

<P>
What is required of the applicant for this step will depend on what tasks
are being volunteered for. The following steps are examples only, and can
be modified as the AM and the applicant see fit, so long as the required
skills are demonstrated.
</P>

<DL>
     <DT>A. Package Management:</DT>
     
     <DD>If the applicant is intending to maintain packages for Debian,
     some demonstration of those skills will be required. The first choice
     is to have the applicant take over on of the "orphaned" packages, but
     any other "useful" package.</DD>
     
     <DT>B. Documentation:</DT>
     
     <DD>The applicant may demonstrate skills in this area by producing a man
     page for a package that doesn't have one; by editing a current document
     to bring it up-to-date; or by producing other documentation required
     but missing from the distribution.</DD>
     
     <DT>C. Debugging and Testing:</DT>
     
     <DD>The applicant will demonstrate skills in this area by working with 
     either the QA team fixing bugs, or by working with the testing team
     testing installation process or individual packages.</DD>
     
     <DT>D. Infrastructure:</DT>
     
     <DD>The opening for these jobs are more complex than either of the others
     and will require cooperation from the current members doing the job 
     that the applicant wishes to help with. Some skills test will be worked
     out between the current team, the Application Manager, and the
     applicant.</DD>
</DL>
     
<P>
Alternative demonstration tasks can be worked out between the applicant and
the Application Manager. Such alternative tasks will require the OK of the
rest of The Committee.
