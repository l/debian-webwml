<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Accessibility is an internal project to develop Debian into an
   operating system that is particularly well fit for the requirements of
   people with disabilities.
   The goal of Debian-Accessibility is a completely accessible system
   which offers users with disabilities the highest possible amount
   of independence, built completely on free software.
</p>
<p>We envisage that Debian-Accessibility will add value to existing
   packages by providing patches to fix problems very specific
   to certain user groups or conducting Accessibility validation tests and
   providing modification suggestions based on the results.
</p>

<h2><a id="email-list" name="email-list">Email List</a></h2>

<p>The Debian-Accessibility mailing list is the central point of communication
   for Debian-Accessibility.  It serves as a forum for potential, as
   well as current, users of the Debian system who do have special needs.
   Additionally, it is used to coordinate development efforts around the various
   topics of Accessibility.  You can subscribe to and unsubscribe from it using
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility/">the list web
   page</a>, and also read the
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-accessibility/">list archives</a>.
</p>

<h2><a id="projects" name="projects">Relevant Software</a></h2>

<p>The first attempt to put the software into categories might be not the
   best. Send any suggestions for improvements to <a href="#email-list">the
   mailing list</a>, or to <a href="mailto:mlang@debian.org">Mario Lang</a>.

<h2><a id="goals" name="goals">Project goals</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Provide information and documentation of Accessibility.</li>
  <li>Ensure that Accessibility software like drivers for specialized
      peripheral devices can be loaded if necessary as early as possible in the
      system startup phase, including the Debian installation process. This is
      to ensure that people with special needs retain a high level of
      independence during maintenance of their own systems.</li>
  <li>Verify and ensure that Debian core infrastructure like our Web site does
      comply with Accessibility Guidelines.</li>
  <li>Bring authors of different projects with similar goals together.</li>
  <li>Help upstream authors to get their products packaged for Debian.</li>
  <li>Show commercial assistive technology vendors the strengths of Free
      Software based systems and make them consider to port their software to
      Linux or even to switch to Open Source.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="help" name="help">What can I do to help?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work on enhancing and translating these web pages.</li>
  <li>Create a logo.</li>
  <li>Documentation and translation.</li>
  <li>Internationalization (which is more than just translating, see
      <a href="software#i18nspeech">internationalized speech
      synthesis</a> for some ideas).</li>
  <li>Verify that the debian.org web site is Accessible according to
      established Accessibility Guidelines and submit enhancement suggestions
      based on your findings.  It could eventually be desirable to apply for
      something like Bobby Approval at some point.</li>
