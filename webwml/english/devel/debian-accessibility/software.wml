<a11y-pkg name="EFlite" tag=eflite url="http://eflite.sourceforge.net/">
<P>
  A speech server for <A href="#emacspeak">Emacspeak</A> and
  <A href="#yasr">yasr</A> (or other screen readers) that allows them to
  interface with <A href="#flite">Festival Lite</A>, a free text-to-speech
  engine developed at the CMU Speech Center as an off-shoot of
  <A href="#festival">Festival</A>.
</P>
<P>
  Due to limitations inherited from its backend, EFlite does only provide
  support for the English language at the moment.
</P>
</a11y-pkg>
<a11y-pkg name="Festival Lite" tag=flite>
<P>
  A small fast run-time speech synthesis engine.  It is the latest
  addition to the suite of free software synthesis tools including
  University of Edinburgh's Festival Speech Synthesis System and
  Carnegie Mellon University's FestVox project, tools, scripts and 
  documentation for building synthetic voices.  However, flite itself
  does not require either of these systems to run.
</P>
<P>
  It currently only supports the English language.

<a11y-pkg name="Festival" tag="festival"
          url="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">
<P>
  A general multi-lingual speech synthesis system developed
  at the <A href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/">CSTR</A> [<i>C</i>entre for
  <i>S</i>peech <i>T</i>echnology <i>R</i>esearch] of
  <A href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/text.html">University of Edinburgh</A>.
</P>
<P>
  Festival offers a full text to speech system with various APIs, as well an
  environment for development and research of speech synthesis techniques.
  It is written in C++ with a Scheme-based command interpreter for general
  control.
</P>
<P>
  Besides research into speech synthesis, festival is useful as a stand-alone
  speech synthesis program. It is capable of producing clearly understandable
  speech from text.
</P>
</a11y-pkg>
<a11y-pkg name="recite" tag="recite">
<P>
  Recite is a program to do speech synthesis.  The quality of sound produced
  is not terribly good, but it should be adequate for reporting the occasional
  error message verbally.
</P>
<P>
  Given some English text, recite will convert it to a series of phonemes,
  then convert the phonemes to a sequence of vocal tract parameters, and
  then synthesis the sound a vocal tract would make to say the sentence.
  Recite can perform a subset of these operations, so it can be used to
  convert text into phonemes, or to produce an utterance based on vocal
  tract parameters computed by another program.

<P>
  Provides a device independent layer for speech synthesis.
  It supports various software and hardware speech synthesizers as
  backends and provides a generic layer for synthesizing speech and
  playing back PCM data via those different backends to applications.
</P>
<P>
  Various high level concepts like enqueueing vs. interrupting speech
  and application specific user configurations are implemented in a device
  independent way, therefore freeing the application programmer from having
  to yet again reinvent the wheel.

<H2><A name="i18nspeech">Internationalised Speech Synthesis</A></H2>
<P>
All the currently available free solutions for software based speech
synthesis seem to share one common deficiency: They are mostly limited to
English, providing only very marginal support for other languages, or in
most cases none at all.
Among all the free software speech synthesizers for Linux, only CMU
Festival supports more than one natural language. CMU Festival can
synthesize English, Spanish and Welsh. German is not
supported. French is not supported. Russian is not supported. When
internationalization and localization are the trends in software and
web services, is it reasonable to require blind people interested in
Linux to learn English just to understand their computer's output and to
conduct all their correspondence in a foreign tongue?
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, speech synthesis is not really Jane Hacker's favourite
homebrew project.  Creating an intelligible software speech
synthesizer involves time-consuming tasks.
Concatenative speech synthesis requires the careful creation of a
phoneme database containing all the possible combinations of sounds
for the target language.
Rules that determine the transformation of the text representation
into individual phonemes also need to be developed and fine-tuned,
usually requiring the division of the stream of characters into
logical groups such as sentences, phrases and words. Such lexical
analysis requires a language-specific lexicon seldom released under a
free license.
</P>
<P>
One of the most promising speech synthesis systems is Mbrola, with
phoneme databases for over ten different languages. Unfortunately, the license
chosen by the project is very restrictive. Mbrola can only be distributed as
a pre-built binary. In addition, the phoneme databases are for
non-military and non-commercial use only. We contacted the project
developers, but they were unable to change the licensing of their
work due to the limitations set by various contributors.  Unfortunately,
given the restrictive licensing model of Mbrola, it cannot be used
as a basis for further work in this direction, at least not in the context
of the Debian Operating System.
</P>
<P>
Without a broadly multi-lingual software speech synthesizer, Linux
cannot be accepted by assistive technology providers and people with
visual disabilities. What can we do to improve this?
</P>
<P>
There are basically two approaches possible:
<OL>
<LI>Organize a group of people willing to help in this regard, and
try to actively improve the situation.  This might get a bit complicated,
since a lot of specific knowledge about speech synthesis will be required,
which isn't that easy if done via an autodidactic approach.  However, this
should not discourage you.  If you think you can motivate a group of
people large enough to achieve some improvements, it would be worthwhile
to do.</LI>
<LI>Obtain funding and hire some institute which already has the
know how to create the necessary phoneme databases, lexica and transformation
rules.  This approach has the advantage that it has a better probability
of generating quality results, and it should also achieve some improvements
much earlier than the first approach.  Of course, the license under which all
resulting work would be released should be agreed on in advance, and it should
pass the DFSG requirements. The ideal solution would of course
be to convince some university to undergo such a project on their own
dime, and contribute the results to the Free Software community.</LI>

<a11y-pkg name="Emacspeak" tag="emacspeak"

<P>
  A speech output system that will allow someone who cannot see

  BRLTTY also provides a client/server based infrastructure for applications

<P>
  The kernel package
  <A href="http://packages.debian.org/kernel-image-2.4.24-speakup">kernel-image-2.4.24-speakup</A>
  contains a Linux kernel patched with speakup, a screen reader for the Linux
  console.  The special property of speakup is that it runs in kernel space,
  which does provide a little bit more low level access to the system then
  other screen readers can provide.
  Speakup can for instance read critical kernel messages to you at a point
  where the kernel has already Oopsed, and no user space program could do
  anything useful at all anymore.

<a11y-pkg name="Yasr" tag="yasr" url="http://yasr.sourceforge.net/">
<P>
  A general-purpose console screen reader for GNU/Linux and
  other Unix-like operating systems.  The name "yasr" is an acronym that
  can stand for either "Yet Another Screen Reader" or "Your All-purpose
  Screen Reader".
</P>
<P>
  Currently, yasr attempts to support the Speak-out, DEC-talk, BNS, Apollo,
  and DoubleTalk hardware synthesizers.  It is also able to communicate with
  Emacspeak speech servers and can thus be used with synthesizers not directly
  supported, such as <A href="#flite">Festival Lite</A> (via
  <A href="#eflite">eflite</A>) or FreeTTS.
</P>
<P>
  Yasr works by opening a pseudo-terminal and running a shell, intercepting
  all input and output.  It looks at the escape sequences being sent and
  maintains a virtual "window" containing what it believes to be on the
  screen.  It thus does not use any features specific to Linux and can be
  ported to other Unix-like operating systems without too much trouble.
