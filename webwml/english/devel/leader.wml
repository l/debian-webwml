<p class="initial">The Debian Project Leader (DPL) is the official
representative of the Debian Project.  They have two main functions,
one internal and one external.</p>

<p>In the external function, the Project Leader represents the Debian
Project to others.  This involves giving talks and presentations about
Debian and attending trade shows, as well as building good relationships
with other organizations and companies.</p>

<p>Internally, the Project Leader manages the project and defines its
vision.  They should talk to other Debian developers, especially to the
delegates, to see how they can assist their work.  A main task of the
Project Leader therefore involves coordination and communication.</p>


<h2>Appointment</h2>

<p>The Project Leader is chosen in an election in which all Debian
Developers are eligible to vote.  The Project Leader's term of office is
one year.  Nine weeks before the leadership post becomes vacant, the
<a href="secretary">Project Secretary</a> initiates a new election.  During
the first three weeks, any Debian Developer can become a candidate for this
post by nominating themselves.  The next three weeks are used for
campaigning.  Each candidate posts their platforms and everyone can direct
questions to one or all candidates.  The last three weeks consist of the
polling period during which developers may cast their votes.</p>
