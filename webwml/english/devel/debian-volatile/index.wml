<h2>debian-volatile for end users</h2>

<p><strong>What is debian-volatile?</strong><br />
Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as spam filtering and virus
scanning, and even when using updated data patterns, they do not really
work for the full time of a stable release. The main goal of volatile
is allowing system administrators to update their systems in a nice,
consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of using unstable, even
without getting the drawbacks for the selected packages.
</p>

<p><strong>debian-volatile and security support</strong><br />
There is no support by the official security-team, 
but the <a href="volatile-team">volatile team</a> will do that. 
Just for notice, one member of the <a href="volatile-team">debian-volatile team</a> 
is also member of the <a href="http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/">Debian testing
security team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Releases of debian-volatile</strong><br />
debian-volatile has both a staging and a release area. The
staging area is only used by the build daemons. There is no guarantee
that packages in this area are usable for end users. 
Packages in the staging area could have not a safe upgrade path, too.
</p>

<p>Packages are moved to the release area whenever a debian-volatile
update announcement (VUA) is send to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile-announce">debian-volatile
announce mailing list</a>. The upgrade path of packages in this area is
guaranteed, as well as the upgrade to the next stable release (<current_testing_name>).</p>

<p><strong>Contact</strong><br />
The generic contact address (new packages, mirror requests, ...) is the mailing list
<a href="mailto:debian-volatile@lists.debian.org">debian-volatile@lists.debian.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to subscribe to that list, please see
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile">http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile</a>
for details.</p>

<p><strong>Archive</strong><br />
The official archive of debian-volatile is available on the main site
<a href="http://volatile.debian.net/debian-volatile">volatile.debian.net</a>, but
a <a href="volatile-mirrors">network of mirrors</a> is active and available.

<h2>debian-volatile for developers</h2>

<p><strong>Acceptance rules</strong><br />
In order to include a package into debian-volatile, it has to meet the
following criteria:</p>
<ul>
 <li>The package should only go in cooperation with the maintainer(s).<br />
 In other words: a package should be uploaded to debian-volatile
 only by its own package maintainer(s). This is the only way we can guarantee
 security support for packages in debian-volatile.</li>

 <li>debian-volatile is not "just another place" for backports, but should only
  contain changes to stable programs that are necessary to keep them
  functional.</li>

 <li>The package should allow any administrator to "just use" volatile, as they "just
   use" security.d.o, and they can be confident that nothing could be broken by
   that.</li>

 <li>The usual Debian bug tracking system should be used for bugs.</li>

 <li>Packages in main cannot require any software outside of main to
   run or build. Packages need to be autoi-buildable within the
   same (stable) release.</li>

 <li>Packages need to be policy-conformant; we usually take
   <a href="http://release.debian.org/sarge_rc_policy.txt">\
http://release.debian.org/sarge_rc_policy.txt</a>
   as a hint about what is not ok.</li>

 <li>The upgrade path from volatile to the next stable release needs to be at
  least as easy as from the current stable release; version number in volatile 
  must not be higher than in testing, for instance.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Procedure to include a package</strong><br />
We experienced that the procedure below works quite well for new
packages inclusion in debian-volatile:</p>
<ol>
<li>Send an e-mail to the mailing list 
   <a href="mailto:debian-volatile@lists.debian.org">debian-volatile@lists.debian.org</a><br />
   This is for discussing your changes in public. It is also a good idea to
   include a link to a unified diff. Please, remember the debian-volatile
   guidelines, i.e. apply necessary changes only.<br />
   Fellow developers are encouraged to join this
   discussions, because the <a href="team">debian-volatile team</a> would know what changes
   the users like, and what not. Everybody on the list is encouraged
   to review the proposed changes.</li>

<li>Upload to debian-volatile<br />
   After receiving consensus from the list, please upload at least
   source and binary-all packages to volatile-master.debian.net
   using FTP. Please document changes in debian/changelog.
   Just saying<br />
   <code>* Upload package to volatile</code><br />
   is <em>NOT</em> acceptable.<br />
   If you already did an upload to volatile for the package, and changes to the
   previous version are security fixes, please tell us in advance. If
   you already have got one or more CAN identifiers, please put them in the changelog for
   the security issues. If you
   do not have any, please tell us anyway, because we can obtain them for you. If you
   want to contact the <a href="team">debian-volatile team</a> in private, then please contact one
   of its members. Sometimes there are embargo dates on
   publication of security bugs / fixes. We respect them.</li>

<li>Packages are built automatically<br />
   Packages are now built by the autobuilder network. No interaction is
   needed here.</li>

<li>volatile-announce-mail is being prepared<br />
   While the package is autobuilt, the debian-volatile team will contact
   you about the content of the announcement mail which will be sent via
   <a href="mailto:debian-volatile-announce@lists.debian.org">debian-volatile-announce@lists.debian.org</a></li>

<li>Package is released.<br />
   The package is finally reviewed and released.</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>How to upload to volatile</strong><br />
You should add the following sniplet to your ~/.dput.cf:</p>
<pre>
[volatile]
method = ftp
fqdn = volatile-master.debian.net
incoming = /pub/UploadQueue/
login = anonymous
hash = md5
</pre>

<p>If you are using dupload, the stanza below should be added 
to your ~/.dupload.conf:</p>
<pre>
$cfg{'volatile'} = {
        fqdn => "volatile-master.debian.net",
        incoming => "/pub/UploadQueue/",
        \# files pass on to dinstall on ftp-master which sends emails itself
        dinstall_runs => 1,
        passive => 1,
};
</pre>
