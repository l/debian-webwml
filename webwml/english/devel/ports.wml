<H1>Release Information</H1>

<P>Unlike most commercial operating systems, Debian is constantly being
improved. Each major release
generally involves the addition of new capabilities while
minor releases only involve software upgrades.
In addition, the
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org">Linux</A> kernel is constantly being
improved.
The nicknames for each release, seen below, are given during development
to keep them separate from released versions.


<A NAME="releases"><P><STRONG>Current Debian release = 1.3.1  (released 2 Jul 1997)</STRONG></A>

<P><STRONG>Debian version 1.2</STRONG> (Nickname: rex)
   <UL>
   <LI>released mid-Dec 1996
        <LI>many new packages
   <LI>many bug fixes
   </UL>

<P><STRONG>Debian version 1.3</STRONG> (Nickname: bo)
   <UL>
   <LI>released - June 1997
        <LI>shadow passwords supported
   <LI>improved package organization
        <LI>better testing of packages implemented
   <LI>zero floppy disk installation (CD is bootable if your machine supports it) 
   <LI>X windows version 3.3
   </UL>

<P><STRONG>Debian version 2.0</STRONG> (Nickname: hamm)
   <UL>
   <LI>estimated release - early 1998
        <LI>based on libc6 (all libraries compiled using -D_REENTRANT)
   <LI>improved package selection program
        <LI>libpam used for authentication
   <LI>first public release for alpha and m68k architectures
   </UL>

<HR>
<A NAME="ports"><P><STRONG>Other architectures:</STRONG></A><BR>
Debian is working on releases for the following architectures. 
[need status information on these]

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>m68k</STRONG>
The m68k distribution was the first non-i386 architecture port and is
probably the most mature.  There are Atari bootdisks and Amiga ones
should be done shortly.

<P>Until recently there were problems with glibc2 on machines with an
68040 or 68060. Anyone with one of these machines should ensure that
they are using the latest glibc (libc6_2.0.5c-1) and a recent kernel
(2.0.31-pre2 or 2.1.57).

<P>Approximately 80% of Debian packages have been compiled for
m68k. Anyone interested in installing the current snapshot of
Debian/m68k is encouraged to join the debian-68k mailing list and
review the mailing list archives to learn more about the state of the
system and hints for successful installation.  It is intended that the
m68k port be ready for public release by the time Debian 2.0 is
released.
<LI><STRONG>alpha</STRONG><BR>
The Alpha distribution is now to a state where installation of a
functional system including the base system and a useful set of
development tools is quite possible from scratch.
Not all of the packages available for the x86 have been
ported yet, but the Alpha distribution was the first Debian distribution
to depend on libc6, and it is likely that the Alpha will be a supported
platform in Debian 2.0.

<BR>Anyone interested in installing the current
snapshot of Debian for Alpha is encouraged to join the debian-alpha mailing
list and review the mailing list archives to learn more about the state of
the system and hints for successful installation.
<LI><STRONG>sparc</STRONG><BR>
The Sparc distribution is progressing, but is waiting for the port of glibc
to Sparc to stabilize before pushing for a release.
<BR>Anyone interested in installing the current
snapshot of Debian for Sparc is encouraged to join the debian-sparc mailing
list and review the mailing list archives to learn more about the state of
the system and hints for successful installation.
<LI><STRONG>mips</STRONG><BR>
*Very* early stage: only ~50 untested packages.
<LI><STRONG>powerpc</STRONG><BR>
Early stage; about 250 working packages, but no install procedure
yet. (No release date planned yet)
