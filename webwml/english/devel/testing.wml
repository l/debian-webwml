#use wml::debian::template title="Debian ``testing'' distribution" BARETITLE=true

<p>For basic, user-oriented information about the testing distribution,
please see <a href="$(DOC)/FAQ/ch-ftparchives#s-testing">the FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>This page primarily covers the aspects of "testing" important to Debian
developers.</p>

<p>The documentation includes:

<ul>
  <li>Jules Bean's <a href="http://people.debian.org/~jules/testingfaq.html">testing FAQ</a>
      which explains some of the cryptic information here.
      <br>
      There was a <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2001/debian-devel-200112/msg00610.html">thread
      on -devel</a> about the FAQ which has some more information that at
      the time of writing hasn't been incorporated properly.
  </li>
  <li>An older
      <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0008/msg00906.html">explanation
      email</a>, which is outdated since James implemented the package pool,
      but you might like to read it anyway.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The update script creates two output files:

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/update_excuses.html">\
      somewhat shorter and nicer, HTML-ized output</a>
      [<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/update_excuses.html.gz">gzipped</a>]
  </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/update_output.txt">\
      somewhat longer and more crude, textual output</a>
      [<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/update_output.txt.gz">gzipped</a>]
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The scripts also detect bugs that can be described as
horribly-severe-shouldn't-be-here-in-the-first-place.
These are all `don't even bother considering this package for inclusion'
offences, which will hopefully all disappear during the freeze, and
bugsquashing days and so forth.
<br>
There are lists of such bugs for all three distributions:

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/testing_probs.html">testing problems</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/unstable_probs.html">unstable problems</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/stable_probs.html">stable problems</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to this, there are some statistics on binary packages
that are out of date for
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/testing_outdate.txt">testing</a>,
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/stable_outdate.txt">stable</a> and
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/testing/unstable_outdate.txt">unstable</a>.</p>

<p>The testing code is available via anonymous CVS from
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/testing/?cvsroot=dak">cvs.debian.org</a>.
Set your <code>CVSROOT</code> to
<kbd>:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/dak</kbd>, module
<kbd>testing</kbd>.</p>
