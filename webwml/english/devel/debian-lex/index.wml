<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Lex is an internal project to develop Debian into an operating
   system that is particularly well fit for the requirements for legal
   offices.
   The goal of Debian-Lex is a complete system for all
   tasks in legal practice which is built completely on free software.
</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the
   <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a> and
   <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a> projects,
   with the majority of the content of this Web site shamelessly pilfered
   from the latter.
</p>

<p>Debian-Lex will contain a set of meta packages that declare dependencies on
   other Debian packages, and that way the complete system is prepared for
   solving particular tasks. We hope that there will soon be a framework for
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2003/debian-vote-200303/msg00014.html">
   flavours of Debian</a> on which Debian-Lex will be based.
</p>

<p>We also envisage that Debian-Lex will add value to existing packages by
   providing customised templates for lawyers.  For example, templates would
   be provided for OpenOffice.org, SQL-Ledger and a sample database schema
   for PostgreSQL.

<h2><a id="talks" name="talks">Talks about Debian-Lex</a></h2>

We will add any talks about Debian-Lex here as source and preformatted
slides. It might be a good idea to check these pages to get some interesting
information about the project.

<h2><a id="help" name="help">What can I do to help?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work on enhancing and translating these web pages.</li>
  <li>Create a logo (here is an <a href="debian-lex.png">example</a>,
      also in <a href="debian-lex.xcf">GIMP format</a>, and here is
      the <a href="legaltux.png">legal TuX</a> on which it is based).</li>
  <li>Packaging the above-mentioned software projects for Debian.</li>
  <li>Building meta packages for different tasks.</li>
  <li>Documentation and translation.</li>
  <li>Internationalization (which is more than just translating
      because of the different legal systems).</li>
  <li>Building a live CD (perhaps based on <a
      href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix</a>).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a id="marketing" name="marketing">Marketing &amp; PR</a></h2>

<p>Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in
   the formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the
   eyes of the world. We will necessarily want to work with
   press@debian.org to get the word out and to help give Debian and
   this project the kind of exposure we want. For this purpose we will
   build a collection of slides of talks about Debian-Lex.
