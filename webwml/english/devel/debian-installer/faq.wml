    <dl>
      <dt>Graphical installer?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, eventually.  The whole architecture in debian-installer
        is based around a C reimplementation of debconf.  That means
        we can easily implement graphical frontends.  Nobody has
        actually done that yet and gotten it to work well.</dd>

    <dt>Where to send patches?</dt>
      <dd>If you are not familiar with the code, please don't just
      commit, even if you have the privilege to.  Please send patches
      to <email debian-boot@lists.debian.org>.
      </dd>

    <dt>Where is an up-to-date TODO list?</dt>
      <dd>In <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/TODO?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">CVS</a>.
      </dd>

    <dt>How do I test my changed udeb?</dt>
      <dd>Put the udeb in build/localudebs and build your image or run
      <kbd>make demo</kbd> as usual.  You might need to run <kbd>make
      clean</kbd> first.
      </dd>

    <dt>Setting up an aptable repository</dt>
    <dd>See this <a href="archive">explaination</a>.</dd>

    <dt>How do I write an installation report?</dt> <dd>Please fill
    out a <a href="report-template">template</a> and mail it to
    <email debian-testing@lists.debian.org>.
    Please file bugs for specific issues.  If you are unsure how to
    file bugs, look at the <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">instructions</a>.  If you know
    which component is buggy, please file the bug against that
    package, else file it against the pseudo-package "installation".
