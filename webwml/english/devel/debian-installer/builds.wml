#use wml::debian::template title="Debian-Installer CD builds"

<p>
There are a number of different builds of the Debian-Installer CD images
that serve different purposes.
</p>
<p>
The most important build is the current official release, currently
beta5 of the installer. These images are static and unchanging, and are
the ones mostly likely to work for most people. While testing of these
images is still useful, most problems with them are well known by the
team within a few weeks of their release. See the <a href="errata">errata
page</a> for the worst of the known issues.
</p>
<p>
The other most commonly used builds are the daily builds. These are our
freshest images, and thus the most likely to be broken, but also the
most likely to have fun and exciting new features.
<a href="report-template">Installation reports</a> using these images are
very valuable to us. New CD images produced each day, containing the latest
packages from sarge. Since these images use the version of the installer from
the unstable distribution, they are also known as "sid_d-i" images, although
they still install sarge.
</p>
<p>
Our third set of builds is only useful near a release. These are CD
images containing the version of the installer in sarge, and the latest
packages from sarge. They're called "sarge_d-i" images, and are intended
for final testing just before release. At release time, one of these
images is picked and becomes the official release image. Between
releases, these images are not very interesting, or useful. Near a
release the links to daily CD builds will be switched to point to these
images, so that they can get testing; so don't bother trying to download
something from the sarge_d-i directory by hand.
