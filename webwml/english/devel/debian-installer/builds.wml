<h2>CD builds</h2>

<p>
There are <a href="ports-status">a number of different builds of the Debian-Installer CD images</a>
that serve different purposes.
</p>
<p>
The most important build is <a href="index">the current official release</a>, currently
rc3 of the installer. These images are static and unchanging, and are
the ones mostly likely to work for most people. While testing of these
images is still useful, most problems with them are well known by the
team within a few weeks of their release. See the <a href="errata">errata
page</a> for the worst of the known issues.
</p>
<p>
The other most commonly used builds are
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/daily/">the daily builds</a>.
These are newer images that need testing in the hopes
of one day becoming an official release. They are just a link to one of the
two types of images described below; which one is linked to depends on
where we are in our release cycle.
<a href="report-template">Installation reports</a> using these images are
very valuable to us.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/sid_d-i/">The sid_d-i
images</a> are new CD images produced each day. These images
use the version of the installer from the unstable distribution, although
they still install Debian sarge. Typically the daily CD build links point
at these images.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/sarge_d-i/">The
sarge_d-i images</a> are also produced each day. They use the version of
the installer from sarge, and install Debian sarge. At release time, one
of these images is picked and becomes the official release image. Near a
release the links to daily CD builds will be switched to point to these
images, so that they can get testing.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/cd/">The weekly full CD</a>
and <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/cdimage-testing/dvd/">DVD</a>
builds are only availale by jidgo. They take several days to build, so are
only regenerated once per week. The version of the installer on these
varies, but is generally the version we want to get tested at the current
time.
</p>

<h2>initrd builds</h2>

<p>
All the other Debian-Installer images, including netboot, floppies, etc,
are collectively known as the "initrd images". Again several different
builds are used.
</p>
<p>
As with the CD images, the most important initrd build is
<a href="index">the current official release</a>.
</p>
<p>
The other most commonly used initrd builds are
<a href="ports-status">the daily builds</a>.
These images are built approximatly once each day by
some Debian-Installer developers, typically on their own personal machines.
They always include the latest version of the installer, from the unstable
distribution.
</p>
<p>
From time to time an official Debian-Installer initrd build will be done,
as part of a release of the <tt>debian-installer</tt> package. These images
are built on the Debian autobuilder network like any other package, and are
placed in the <tt>dists/unstable/main/binary-&lt;arch&gt;/current</tt>
subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
When Debian-Installer is released, one of these official builds is copied
to the <tt>dists/testing/main/binary-&lt;arch&gt;/current</tt>
subdirectory.
</p>

<h2>Build status page</h2>

<p>
The status of all of the periodically built images is tracked and collected
on <a href="http://people.debian.org/~joeyh/d-i/build-logs.html">the build
status page</a>. This page can't tell if the images work, only if it was
successfully built.
