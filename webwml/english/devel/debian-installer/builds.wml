#use wml::debian::template title="Debian-Installer CD builds"

<p>
There are a number of different builds of the Debian-Installer CD images
that serve different purposes.
</p>
<p>
The most important build is the current official release, currently
beta4 of the installer. These images are static and unchanging, and are
the ones mostly likely to work for most people. While testing of these
images is still useful, most problems with them are well known by the
team within a few weeks of their release. See the <a href="errata">errata
page</a> for the worst of the known issues.
</p>
<p>
The other most commonly used builds are the daily builds, or occasionally,
test candidate images. These are newer images that need testing in the hopes
of one day becoming an official release. They are just a link to one of the
two types of images described below; which one is linked to depends on
where we are in our release cycle.
<a href="report-template">Installation reports</a> using these images are
very valuable to us.
</p>
<p>
The sid_d-i images are new CD images produced each day. These images
use the version of the installer from the unstable distribution, although
they still install Debian sarge. Typically the daily CD build links point
at these images.
</p>
<p>
The sarge_d-i images are also produced each day. They use the version of
the installer from sarge, and install Debian sarge. At release time, one
of these images is picked and becomes the official release image. Near a
release the links to daily CD builds will be switched to point to these
images, so that they can get testing.
