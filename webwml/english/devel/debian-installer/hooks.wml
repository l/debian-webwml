#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Installer Hooks"

    <p>This is a list of available hooks available for
      debian-installer modules and extentions.</p>

    <dl>

      <dt>/etc/rcS.d/S[0-9][0-9]* [rootskel]</dt>

      <dd>If this is an executable program, it is executed when d-i is
	booting, before the main menu is presented.</dd>

      <dt>/cdrom/.disk/udeb_include [anna]<br>/cdrom/.disk/udeb_exclude</dt>

      <dd>List of packages (udebs) to install or not install in into
	the d-i ramdisk.</dd>

      <dt>/etc/autopartkit.d/*.table [autopartkit]</dt>

      <dd>Partition table instructions for autopartkit.  The selection
	is done using debconf.</dd>
      
      <dt>/cdrom/.disk/base_include [base-installer]<br>/cdrom/.disk/base_exclude</dt>
      
      <dd>The content of these files are taken as lists of packages to
        install or not into the target area.</dd>

      <dt>/usr/lib/prebaseconfig.d/* [prebaseconfig]</dt>

      <dd>The files in this directory are executed in sequence at the
	end of the installation.</dd>

      <dt>/var/lib/partconf/fstab.d/* [partconf?]</dt>

      <dd>partconf and mkfstab read all files in this directory and
	append the lines (with or without modification) to the
	generated /target/etc/fstab</dd>

      <dt>/usr/share/partitioner/${ARCH}.sh [partitioner?]<br>/usr/share/partitioner/common.sh</dt>
      <dd>partitioner first try to call the shell script for the
        current architecture, and if this script doesn't exist it runs
        common.sh with the selection harddisk as argument. The script
        can the do whatever is needed to partition a harddisk on this
        arch (eg running fdisk (text) or cfdisk (slang))</dd>

      <dt>/var/lib/partconf/block.d/* [partconf?]</dt>

      <dd>partconf execute for each partition every script in this
        directory, so some udebs can place scripts here, and then block
	the output of some partitions; very useful for raid/lvm support
	<br>( planned to included by Thorsten Sauter )
      </dd>

      <dt>apt-install [rootskel]</dt>

      <dd>Program used in postinst scripts to ask for a package to be
	installed into the installed system.</dd>

    </dl>
