    <h1>How to get involved in debian-installer</h1>

    <p>Debian-installer is in need of your help.  We need both C and
      shell hackers in addition to translations, documentation and
      last but not least: testing.  To get involved, subscribing to <a
      href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> and
      checking out the debian-installer module from debian-boot CVS
      would be a good start.  Read the documentation in README and
      doc/*.
      </p>

    <h2>How to check out debian-installer (anonymously)</h2>
    
    <blockquote><code>cvs -d
        :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co
        debian-installer
      </code></blockquote>
    <h2>How to check out debian-installer (via ssh, if you are a
      Debian Developer)</h2>
    
    <blockquote><code>CVS_RSH=ssh cvs -d
        :ext:<var>$userid</var>@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot co
        debian-installer     
      </code></blockquote>
    (replace <var>$userid</var> with your login on Debian machines)

    <h2>Testing the installer</h2>

<p>Official Net Install CD images are being built, and are
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/">available</a>:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/i386/sarge-i386-businesscard.iso">debian-installer and doc only, requires net access</a> (41MB)<br>
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/i386/sarge-i386-netinst.iso">debian-installer and base system, basic install possible without net access</a> (83MB)<br>
</p>

    <p>Daily-built images are available from <a
    href="http://people.debian.org/~sjogren/d-i/images/daily/">Martin Sj&ouml;gren's</a>
    repositories.</p>  
    <p>Joey Hess used to build daily images, but he
    seems to have stopped doing that lately.  If you, for some reason,
    is interested in those images, please grab them from his  <a
    href="http://people.debian.org/~joeyh/debian-installer/daily/images/">\
    repository</a>.</p>

<p>Official "testing" full CD images' Jigdo files are also available
at <url "http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/jigdo-area/">.
They are regularly updated.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>Graphical installer?</dt>
      <dd>Yes, eventually.  The whole architecture in debian-installer
        is based around a C reimplementation of debconf.  That means
        we can easily implement graphical frontends.  Nobody has
        actually done that yet and gotten it to work well.</dd>

    <dt>Where to send patches?</dt>
      <dd>If you are not familiar with the code, please don't just
      commit, even if you have the privilege to.  Please send patches
      to <email debian-boot@lists.debian.org>.
      </dd>

    <dt>Where is an up-to-date TODO list?</dt>
      <dd>In <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/TODO?rev=HEAD&amp;content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">CVS</a>.
      </dd>

    <dt>How do I test my changed udeb?</dt>
      <dd>Put the udeb in build/localudebs and build your image or run
      <kbd>make demo</kbd> as usual.  You might need to run <kbd>make
      clean</kbd> first.
      </dd>

    <dt>Setting up an aptable repository</dt>
    <dd>See this <a href="archive">explaination</a>.</dd>

    <dt>How do I write an installation report?</dt> <dd>Please fill
    out a <a href="report-template">template</a> and mail it to
    <email debian-testing@lists.debian.org>.
    Please file bugs for specific issues.  If you are unsure how to
    file bugs, look at the <a
    href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">instructions</a>.  If you know
    which component is buggy, please file the bug against that
    package, else file it against the pseudo-package "installation".
