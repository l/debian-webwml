<h3>Character encoding</h3>

<p>You should ensure that you are using the proper character encoding.
If you don't use a proper encoding, your translation will not build.
The default encoding for XML documents is UTF-8.  If you want to use a
different character encoding, you'll have to specify this explicitly
in the XML preamble.</p>

<p>In case you want to use a different encoding you'll have to add the
following line as the first line in every translated document:</p>

<pre>
   &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;
</pre>

<p>In this case it was assumed that you want to use ISO-8859-1 as
character encoding.  Use a different value if you use a different
encoding.  You can see the French (fr) and Dutch (nl) translations as
examples for these.</p>

<p>The preferred character encoding, though, is UTF-8.  An example for
this is the Greek (el) translation.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>To make checking for changes in the original English documents
easier, please replace the following lines:</p>

<pre>
   &lt;!-- retain these comments for translator revision tracking --&gt;
   &lt;!-- &#036;Id: welcome.xml 12756 2004-04-06 22:23:56Z fjpop-guest &#036; --&gt;
</pre>

<p>with the following line</p>

<pre>
   &lt;!-- original version: 12756 --&gt;
</pre>

<p>in every document that you translate.  The number in the new line
should be the same as the revision number in the original file which
you have translated.</p>
