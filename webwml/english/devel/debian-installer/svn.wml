<p>
Debian-Installer uses subversion for source control.  To check out the
installer use one of the commands below.
</p>

<h3>Checkout of current development version</h3>

<b>Anonymous checkout</b>

<blockquote><p><code>svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk debian-installer</code></p></blockquote>

<b>Checkout over ssh, for developers</b>

<blockquote><p>
<code>svn co svn+ssh://<var>$userid</var>@svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/trunk debian-installer</code><br />
(replace <var>$userid</var> with your <a href="http://alioth.debian.org">Alioth</a> user ID)
</p></blockquote>

<p>In order to access the repository (also for writing) you'll have
to request to be added to the <code>d-i</code> project group on Alioth.
For this send a mail with an explanation to the project admins.</p>

<h3>Checkout of the Sarge branch</h3>

<p>
If you are interested in customizing the version of the installer released with Sarge,
you should check out the Sarge branch instead of trunk.
</p>

<p>
Use the command below for anonymous checkout. Checkout over ssh is analogous to the example for trunk above.
</p>

<blockquote><p><code>svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/d-i/branches/d-i/sarge</code></p></blockquote>

<h3>Building Debian-Installer</h3>

<p>
If you want to build Debian-Installer yourself, start by reading the
README file in the <code>./installer/build/</code> directory.
There is also a lot of information available on the project's
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller">wiki pages</a>.
</p>

<p>
Note that the current development version should be build in an <i>unstable</i> environment
and the Sarge version should be build in a <i>sarge</i> environment.
