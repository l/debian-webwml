<p>
Preparations have begun for the beta 2 release of Debian Installer for
Lenny. The changes to the Debian archive are known to break some
installation media from the lenny beta 1 release.
</p>

<p>
Affected are images that load installer components from a network
mirror (netboot, mini.iso and floppy). Please use daily built
images instead.
</p>

<p>
The Beta 1 CD images should continue to work.
