<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">\
team</a> is proud to announce the first beta of Debian Lenny's Installer.
</p>

<p>
This is the first release since Etch and the whole team has been hard
at work during the past 11 months to make this release full of new
features and bugfixes.
</p>

<p>
We do need your help to find bugs and further improve the installer,
so please try it.
</p>

<h2>Improvements in this release of the installer</h2>

<p>
A comprehensive changelog of what has changed since the release of
Etch is <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/HumanReadableChangelogs/LennyBeta1">\
available on the wiki</a>.
</p>

<h3>Support for CD/DVD sets is back</h3>

<p>
Support for loading additional CDs or DVDs from a set (a feature
missing in Etch) has been added again. As language-related packages do
not all fit on the first CD, this greatly improves the situation for
non-English speakers performing installations without internet
connectivity.
</p>

<h3>Clock synchronization using NTP</h3>

<p>
By default, the installer will now attempt to synchronize the system
clock using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) when a network connection
has been configured. The hardware clock will be updated before the
system is rebooted.
</p>

<p>
This ensures a valid system time during installation, preventing odd
behaviors with cryptographic signatures or filesystem checks.
</p>

<h3>Support for <q>volatile</q> has been added</h3>

<p>
The installer now supports adding the <q>volatile.debian.org</q> repository
when adding additional APT sources. In the same way as
security.debian.org, it will be configured by default when the
<q>stable</q> distribution is installed.
</p>

<p>
In addition, it is now possible to disable the security and volatile
sources when the installer is run in expert mode and
security.debian.org will be configured by default for installations of
<q>testing</q>.
</p>

<p>
Please read the <a href="http://www.debian.org/volatile">\
debian-volatile homepage</a> for more information about the volatile
project.
</p>

<h3>Starting the installer from Microsoft Windows</h3>

<p>
Since the integration of the <a href="https://packages.debian.org/win32-loader">\
win32-loader package</a>, it is now possible to start the installer
directly from Microsoft Windows without the need to change BIOS
settings. Upon insertion of a CD-ROM, DVD-ROM or USB stick, an autorun
program will be started, offering a step-by-step process to start the
Debian Installer. A few installer settings (including language) will
be preconfigured from this process.
</p>

<h3>Experimental support for Serial ATA RAID (dmraid)</h3>

<p>
As <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2007/07/msg00008.html">\
previously announced</a>, the Debian Installer now includes
experimental support for installing Debian on systems with Serial ATA
RAID as supported in Linux via the dmraid utility. Please see the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SataRaid">dedicated wiki
page</a> for more information.
</p>
