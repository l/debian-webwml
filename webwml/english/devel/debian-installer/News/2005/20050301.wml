<p>
Final preparations have begun for release candidate 3. Some of the changes
to the Debian archive may break installation media from release candidate
2. We hope to get rc3 out as soon as possible to fix this.
</p>

<p>
The most likely image to break is the businesscard CD image and the netboot
images. Network installs from rc2 floppys will break. 
Netinst CD images, and full CD images, and booting from USB or floppy to
install using those CD images, will continue to work no matter what.
This page will be updated if rc3 preparations are found to have broken
any other install images.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of these installation methods, use
the daily built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing for
rc3, so file installation reports!
