<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstallerTeam">\
team</a> is proud to announce the first beta release of the Debian Installer
for Debian GNU/Linux Etch.
</p>

<p>
Improvements in this release of the installer include:
<ul>
<li>Debian testing (etch) is now installed by default, instead of sarge, and
features several months of development and updates.
</li>
<li>This new version of the installer uses and installs the 2.6.12 kernel, instead
of the 2.6.8 kernel used in the sarge release.
</li>
<li>2.6 is now the default kernel for i386 and sparc (and remains the default
kernel for powerpc, amd64, ia64 and hppa). Boot with "<tt>install24</tt>" to
install using the 2.4 kernel.
</li>
<li>The installer supports a rescue mode for recovering broken systems. Boot
with "<tt>rescue</tt>".
</li>
<li>An alpha release of a graphical version of the installer is available for
the i386, amd64, and powerpc architectures.
</li>
<li>Improved locale selection, timezone and clock setup, and preseeding.
</li>
<li>Automatic laptop detection and installation of a laptop task.
</li>
<li>Secure apt is used to cryptographically verify downloaded packages.
</li>
<li>Improved log file management and bug reporting.
</li>
<li>Automatically installs acpi and acpid if the hardware supports it.
</li>
<li>Added the following languages: Malagasy, Macedonian, Tagalog, Belarusian,
Esperanto, Wolof, Xhosa, Estonian and Kurdish
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This release no longer supports the following:
<ul>
<li>sparc32: Dropped support for installations using 2.6 kernel.
</li>
<li>s390: This architecture is not supported by this installer release. We
hope to support it again in the next release.
</li>
<li>See the <a href="../../errata">errata</a> for other known issues and
workarounds.
</li>
</ul>
