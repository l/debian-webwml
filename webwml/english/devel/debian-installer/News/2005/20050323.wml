<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/?DebianInstallerTeam">
team</a> is proud to announce the third release candidate
of the Debian Installer for Debian GNU/Linux Sarge. We love doing this so
much that we couldn't resist updating the installer one more time before
the official release of Debian 3.1.
</p>

<p>
The most significant change in this release are updated versions of all
kernels that include numerous security fixes. Also, users of the hppa
architecture, please note that the 2.6 kernel is now used by default, and
the 2.4 kernel is no longer available for hppa.
</p>

<p>
For users of Microsoft OSes, we're pleased to include a new version of
parted in this version of the installer, which should do much better at
keeping your Windows OS bootable when partitioning for Debian.
</p>

<p>
Of course this release also includes three months of improvements to the
software in Debian sarge.
</p>

<p>
We've also spent the last few months fixing all the other errata items
from rc2, along with many other bugs, polishing the documentation, and in
general making this the most spiffy new Debian Installer release ever. Come
and get it!
</p>

<p>
Installation CDs, other media, and everything else you'll need are
available from our <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer">web site</a>.
