<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">team</a> is pleased to announce the first beta release of the installer for Debian GNU/Linux Squeeze.
</p>
<p>
This release is dedicated to Frans Pop, who worked as Debian Installer Release Manager for several years. Even after he stepped out from this responsibility in 2007, Frans continued to be heavily involved in several aspects of D-I until he passed away.
</p>
<p>
Frans played a key role in ensuring that D-I was constantly maintained at the high quality level that had been set by its original developers. In particular, Frans kept the Installation Guide in very good shape throughout the period that he was involved in D-I.
</p>
<p>
Frans' name will remain associated with Debian Installer, and his loss is deeply regretted by Debian Installer developers, contributors and translators.

<h1>Win32-Loader</h1>

The i386 and amd64 CDs include a Windows executable (setup.exe - hence will get autorun'ed) which job is to get the user from a running Windows(TM) to a d-i environment, without breaking the Windows boot. This executable (in the Debian "win32-loader" package) installs the d-i initrd and a grub bootloader on the "boot disk" of Windows(TM). After reboot, the install goes on from that image and uses the material on the CD for the install.

As this binary is not meant to be launched in a Debian environment (but within Windows), it has not necessarily been well tested: it would really benefit from being launched in all Windows versions for all languages!

<h1>Thanks</h1>

The Debian Installer team thanks everybody who has contributed to this release.
