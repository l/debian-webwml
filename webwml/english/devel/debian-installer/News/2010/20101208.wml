<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">team</a> is pleased to announce the second beta release of the installer for Debian GNU/Linux Squeeze.
</p>
<p>
This release is dedicated to Frans Pop, who worked as Debian Installer Release Manager for several years. Even after he stepped out from this responsibility in 2007, Frans continued to be heavily involved in several aspects of D-I until he passed away.
</p>
<p>
Frans played a key role in ensuring that D-I was constantly maintained at the high quality level that had been set by its original developers. In particular, Frans kept the Installation Guide in very good shape throughout the period that he was involved in D-I.
</p>
<p>
Frans' name will remain associated with Debian Installer, and his loss is deeply regretted by Debian Installer developers, contributors and translators.
</p>
