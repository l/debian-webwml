<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">\
team</a> is proud to announce the first release candidate (RC1) of the installer
for Debian GNU/Linux Etch.
</p>

<h2>Improvements in this release of the installer</h2>
<ul>
<li>This new version of the installer uses and installs the 2.6.17
    kernel which is now the default for all architectures.</li>
<li>The installer will now create ext3 partitions with important options
    like resize_inode and dir_index enabled by default; the first means
    that on-line resizing of ext3 partitions is supported.</li>
<li>The 2.6.17 kernel should support installing from most CD-ROM/DVD drives
    in systems with a SATA controller. However, there are known issues
    in 2.6.17 with some controllers that have been fixed in 2.6.18.</li>
<li>Guided partitioning now also supports setting up the system on an
    encrypted LVM partition.</li>
<li>Because of the previous change, the user interface for guided
    partitioning was modified: users are now asked first for the type of
    guided partitioning to be done and next for the disk to be used.
    This change also affects preseeding <sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Improved support for fully automated installations
    <sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>.</li>
<li>It is now possible to partition multiple disks with software RAID
    (levels 0, 1 and 5) using preseeding <sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>.</li>
<li>When configuring the network using DHCP, the installer will send
    vendor-option-string <q>d-i</q>. Using this the DHCP server can be set up
    to tell the installer which preconfiguration file to use
    <sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Because SELinux has been made standard priority, newly installed
    systems will have SELinux support. However, to actually use SELinux,
    this needs to be enabled manually after the installation.</li>
<li>Architecture specific:
    <ul>
    <li>i386: installation from floppy disk is supported again</li>
    <li>arm: the Linksys NSLU2 has switched to the generic ixp4xx kernel
        and now uses APEX as the 2nd stage boot loader; using APEX allows
        to work around the NSLU2's 1 MB kernel limit</li>
    <li>arm: support for the sub-architecture IOP32x has been added;
        the first device that is supported is the
        <a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/glantank">GLAN Tank</a></li>
    </ul></li>
<li>Added the following languages (for the graphical installer only):
    Gujarati.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No longer supported as of this release</h2>
<ul>
<li>Installation using a 2.4 kernel.</li>
<li>The following languages have been dropped because their translations
    were not sufficiently complete to be included in the Etch release:
    Belarusian, Gaelic (Irish), Georgian, Icelandic, Kazakh, Malagasy,
    Northern Sami, Persian, Welsh, Xhosa.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>
<ul>
<li>Partition resizing using partman may result in data loss if the
    starting sector of the partition is not at the start of a cylinder.<br />
    This has been observed in particular for NTFS partitions created
    during installation of Windows Vista Beta 2. Resizing of NTFS
    partitions created by earlier Windows versions should still work.<br />
    Because of this resizing of NTFS partitions containing Windows Vista
    has been blocked.</li>
<li>There are some usability issues for S/390 installs.</li>
<li>There are still various issues for some powerpc subarchitectures.</li>
<li>For sparc32 CD-ROM support is broken in the esp kernel driver; use
    the netboot installation method instead.</li>
<li>For SGI Indigo2 systems (mips) keyboard support may still be broken
    (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/382983">#382983</a>).</li>
<li>VGA console on TITAN- and TSUNAMI-class systems (alpha) is not supported;
    this is expected to be fixed for RC2.</li>
<li>Known issues for the graphical installer:
    <ul>
    <li>some tasks (e.g. the File server task) may not install correctly due
        to bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/282147">#282147</a></li>
    <li>switching consoles will crash the frontend on amd64</li>
    <li>support for keymaps other than US has improved, but there are still
        some issues (deadkeys and combining characters do not work)</li>
    <li>limited support for creating encrypted partitions</li>
    <li>touchpads may not work correctly; use an external mouse instead</li>
    <li>should work on almost all PowerPC systems that have an ATI graphics
        card, but is unlikely to work on other PowerPC systems.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

a full list of known issues.
</p>

<p>
Note that at least one more release of the installer is expected before 
Etch is released; this next release of the installer will use the 2.6.18 
kernel.
