<p>
Final preparations have begun for the etch beta 3 release of Debian Installer.
The changes to the Debian archive are known to break most of the installation
media from etch beta 2.
We hope to get beta 3 out as soon as possible to fix this.

<p>
The only images that should remain usable are the full installation CDs. The
netinst installation CDs are currently still usable, but that may change.

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of the other installation methods, use
the daily built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing for
beta 3, so file installation reports!
