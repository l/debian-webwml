<p>
Final preparations have begun for the Etch Beta2 release of Debian Installer.
The changes to the Debian archive are known to break most of the installation
media from Etch Beta1.
We hope to get Beta2 out as soon as possible to fix this.

<p>
The only images that should still be usable are the full installation CDs.

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of the other installation methods, use
the daily built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing for
Beta2, so file installation reports!
