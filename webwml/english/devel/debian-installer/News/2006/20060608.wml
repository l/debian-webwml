<p>
Integration of the amd64 architecture into the main Debian archive is in
process, and as part of this the external amd64 mirror network no longer
includes packages for testing or unstable. Debian-Installer amd64 beta2
images that were built to use that mirror network will thus no longer
successfully install Debian. The full CDs and DVD should still work.

<p>
The next release of the installer will include support for the amd64
architecture in the main Debian archive.
