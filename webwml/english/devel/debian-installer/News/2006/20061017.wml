<p>
Final preparations have begun for the first release candidate of Debian Installer
for Etch.
The changes to the Debian archive are known to break most of the installation
media from etch beta 3.
We hope to get RC1 out as soon as possible to fix this.

<p>
The only images that should remain usable are the full installation CDs and DVDs.
The other CD images are possibly still usable, but that is not guaranteed.

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of the other installation methods, use
the daily built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing for
RC1, so please file installation reports!
