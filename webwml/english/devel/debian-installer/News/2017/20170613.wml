<p>
The Debian Installer <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">team</a> is pleased to
announce the fifth release candidate of the installer for Debian 9
<q>Stretch</q>.
</p>

<p>
This will be the last release candidate, and the next upload of the
debian-installer package will be used for the final Debian 9.0 build,
without a separate announcement for the installer.
</p>


<h2>Improvements in this release</h2>

<ul>
  <li>base-installer:
    <ul>
      <li>Only enable a resume option if a suitable device exists
        (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/860403">#860403</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>debian-cd:
    <ul>
      <li>Since the firefox browser no longer fitted on the Xfce CD,
        the installation guide was removed from those images to free
        up some space, so that firefox fits again.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>debian-installer:
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure gen-hd-image exits as soon as an error is
        triggered (See: <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/864260">#864260</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>debian-archive-keyring-udeb:
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for Stretch keys (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/860830">#860830</a>, <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/860831">#860831</a>), and remove
        support for Squeeze ones (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/863303">#863303</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>espeak-ng:
    <ul>
      <li>Adjust buffer size again, to avoid overlapping.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>netcfg:
    <ul>
      <li>The rdnssd package is no longer installed automatically for
        IPv6 setups. Depending on package installation choices, it
        could prevent network-manager from being installed
        (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/854801">#854801</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Hardware support changes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>debian-installer:
    <ul>
      <li>Bump partition size for armhf SD card images from 40MB to
        100MB (for both hd-media and netboot), since it became too
        small for some setups. This fixes missing files for the
        A10-OLinuXino-Lime platform, and allows developers for easier
        debugging (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/864260">#864260</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>grub-installer:
    <ul>
      <li>Add support for systems with a large number of disks (>= 27),
        which can happen in some JBOD setups (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/839894">#839894</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>linux:
    <ul>
      <li>udeb: Add efivarfs to efi-modules, which can be needed to
        retrieve firmware or configuration bits from the Debian
        Installer (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/862555">#862555</a>).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Localization status</h2>

  <li>Full translation for 21 of them.</li>
