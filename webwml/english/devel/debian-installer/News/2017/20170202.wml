<p>
The Debian Installer <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">team</a> is pleased to
announce the second release candidate of the installer for Debian 9
<q>Stretch</q>.
</p>


<h2>Important change in this release</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A major update of os-prober was included in this release. This
    component is responsible for finding other operating systems so
    that entries can be added to the bootloader's menu. This update
    should fix serious bugs, some of which leading to file system
    corruption, but might also trigger some regressions. As usual,
    running <code>reportbug os-prober</code> from the installed system
    lets you report any issues.</li>
</ul>
