<p>
Debian-Installer has for the first time shipped as the installer to a
released GNU/Linux Distribution: 
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/press/press_releases/skolelinux_v1.0">Skolelinux 1.0</a>
is a Debian derived distribution for use in the schools. The Skolelinux
team has worked closely with the Debian-Installer team throughout the
development of the installer, and they are able to use Debian-Installer to
install an entire school network in a matter of hours, without needing to
make any code changes to our installer, a testimony to both the flexibility
of Debian-Installer, and the good work of the Skolelinux developers.
