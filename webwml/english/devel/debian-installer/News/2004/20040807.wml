<p>
The Debian-Installer team announces the first release candidate of the
Debian sarge installer. Notable improvements in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for the s390 architecture, completing the full set of 11 
	released Debian architectures.</li>
	<li>Added support for more subarches for arm (riscpc, riscstation),
	m68k (bvme6000, mvme147, mvme16x), mipsel (cobalt) and powerpc
	(oldworld).</li>
	<li>Native port to the amd64 architecture. Note that amd64 packages
	are not yet available in the Debian archive; packages and images are
	available from the 
	<a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/amd64">Debian amd64 project</a>.</li>
	<li>CD images finally work for sparc64.</li>
	<li>Full size CD images are available as part of the release for the
	first time. Note that this is <em>not</em> an official release of
	Debian sarge, just a Debian-Installer beta release.</li>
	<li>Supports installing using the 2.6 kernel on powerpc.</li>
	<li>Installing with the 2.6 kernel on i386 is no longer considered
	experimental as it was in previous betas, but is still not the
	default.</li>
	<li>Support for firewire CD drives and firewire ethernet.</li>
	<li>Added and improved support for a wide variety of other
	hardware.</li>
	<li>Improved documentation.</li>
	<li>Numerous bug fixes and improvements -- far too many to list
	here.</li>
	<li>Translated into 40 languages (36 fully complete), including new
	translations to Croatian and Farsi.</li>
	<li>The latest and greatest versions of everything from Debian's
	testing distribution, which is close to official release
	itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're confident that this is our best release ever, so give it a try,
install Debian today, and don't forget to file an installation report so we
can continue to make the installer even better.
