<p>
The Debian-Installer's repository has moved from cvs to subversion. The old
cvs repository is open for read-only access; all committers should have
access to the subverison repository. See <a href="../../svn">this pagr</a>
for details. The <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/book/index.html">
subversion book</a> is the best documentation for newcomers to subversion.
