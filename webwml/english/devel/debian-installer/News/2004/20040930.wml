<p>
The pre-rc2 release is a preview of new features we hope to add to the next
release candidate. This release is an opportunity to get some wider testing
of our most recent improvements to the installer before we declare it
stable and ready for the release of sarge.
</p>

<p>
In the nearly two months since the release of rc1, we've made a number of
improvements to the installer, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for completely automated installs via
        <a href="https://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch04s07.html">debconf
	database preseeding</a>.</li>
	<li>Online resizing of NTFS filesystems.</li>
	<li>Support for booting from LVM.</li>
	<li>Support for booting from software RAID 1 (experimental).</li>
	<li>Software RAID 5.</li>
	<li>2.4.27 and 2.6.8.1 kernels.</li>
	<li>Support for piles of additional hardware.</li>
	<li>Fixed all of the errata of rc1.</li>
	<li>Installs possible with at little as 24 mb of memory.</li>
	<li>Two months of improvements to the software in Debian sarge.</li>
	<li>More other improvements than we could list here in a week.</li>
</ul>

<p>
This version of the installer is <em>not</em> suitable to be used as the final
installer for the Debian sarge release; it may have rough edges and not all
the translations are up-to-date. It should work fine for most people, and
we welcome your installation reports.
