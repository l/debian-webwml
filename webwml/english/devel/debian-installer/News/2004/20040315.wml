</ul>

<p>
This release fixes all of the posted 
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">errata</a> in beta 2 of the
Debian-Installer, and many other bugs besides. We anticipate that most
users will find it a great improvement from past betas. Please send us a
report of how your installation goes, so we can strive to make it even
better.
</p>

<p>
How to try out the beta:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Download one of the CDs or other images from the
	<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer">d-i website</a>.</li>
	<li>Read the <a href="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/installer-i386/current/doc/INSTALLATION-HOWTO">INSTALLATION HOWTO</a>
	and <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">errata</a> before
	installing.</li>
	<li>File an install report as a bug against the pseudo-package 
	'installation-reports' in the Debian bug tracking system. If your
	installation was successful, there will be a template for install
	reports in /root/install-report.template. This template is also
	available <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">on
	the web</a>. Please use this template when filling installation
	reports.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We appreciate all the testing and feedback we've received for past versions
of the installer, and hope this one is the best one yet!
</p>
