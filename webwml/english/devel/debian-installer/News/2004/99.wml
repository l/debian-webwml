<p>
The Debian-Installer team announces the fourth beta release of the Debian
sarge installer. Notable improvements in this release include:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Support for the arm, hppa, and mipsel architectures, bringing the
	number of supported architectures to 9. (The mips architecture is
	not yet ready for this beta, it will be released in a few days.)</li>
	<li>Experimental support for the 2.6 kernel, on i386 only. The 2.4
	kernel remains the default and recommended kernel for most
	hardware.</li>
	<li>Detection of existing operating systems. The following operating
	systems can be detected and will be added to the boot menu of the
	installed system: Windows, Mac OS, Linux, GNU Hurd, DOS</li>
	<li>Translated into 35 languages, including new translations to
	Indonesian, Basque, Galician, Romanian and Welsh.</li>
	<li>Many bug fixes and user interface improvements.</li>
	<li>Fixes for most of the listed 
	<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/errata">errata</a> for beta 3 of the
	installer.</li>
	<li>A new boot logo by Alessandro Polverini and Andrea
	Mottola.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We're confident that this is our best release ever, so give it a try,
install Debian today, and don't forget to file an installation report so we
can continue to make the installer even better. Links to bootable images and
documentation are on our <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer">web site</a>.
