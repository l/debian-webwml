<p>
On November 21st, several Debian machines, including some that hosted part
of the debian-installer infrastructure, were compromised by an attacker.
debian-installer is now mostly recovered from this incident, but there is
currently no access to beta 1 CD images, or some daily builds, that were
hosted on the compromised machine. A few developers have made known good
snapshots from past daily builds available:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.soziologie.ch/~steinlin/d-i/powerpc/">powerpc</a>
</ul>

<p>
Despite these problems, we are making plans for releasing beta 2 of the
installer toward the end of this month.
