#use wml::debian::news

More than ten debian-installer developers met for four
days in Oldenburg and worked quite successfully on the new installer as the
flood of CVS messages demonstrated. As a result PowerPC is perhaps better
supported by debian-installer right now than is i386. Quite a lot of work
was done on general user interface issues. Many issues have been resolved
or worked on.
