<p>
We are pleased to announce the first beta release of debian-installer, the
new installation system for sarge. This first beta is for the following
architectures only:</p>
<ul>
<li>i386.</li>
<li>PowerPC, with support for the subarchitectures Apple Newworld, Pegasus
    PPC and IBM RS/6000 (PrEP, CHREP).</li>
</ul>
<p>
More architectures will follow in later betas.
</p>

<p>
There are still some problems and rough edges (see the 
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/TODO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">TODO</a>
if you want to help out), but in general, what we need most now is broad
testing. That is why we want users to help us by testing this beta.
</p>

<p>
How to try out the beta:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download one of the available CD or floppy images from the
    <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">d-i website</a>.</li>
<li>Read the <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/doc/INSTALLATION-HOWTO?rev=HEAD&content-type=text/vnd.viewcvs-markup">debian-installer
    HOWTO</a> and install on whatever hardware you can. All testing is
    valuable, but unusual hardware setups are of course more likely to
    trigger unknown bugs. Also see the
    <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata">errata</a>
    for known bugs and workarounds.</li>
<li>File an install report as a bug against the pseudo-package
    `installation-reports' in the BTS. Your install report should say whether
    the install was successful or not, what problems you encountered
    during the installation, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If your installation was sucessful, there will be a template for install
reports in /root/install-report.template -- this template is also
available <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/errata">on
the web</a>. Please use this template when filing install reports.
</p>

<p>
Good luck with testing debian-installer!
</p>
