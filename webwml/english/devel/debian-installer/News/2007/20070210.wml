<p>
The expiry of the Debian archive's signing key for 2006 has broken most
of the installation media from etch RC1. The only images that should remain
usable are the full installation CDs and DVDs, but only if used without a
network mirror.
</p>

<p>
Final preparations have begun for the second release candidate of the 
Debian Installer for Etch, and we hope to get RC2 out as soon as possible
to fix this.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of the other installation methods, use
the daily or weekly built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing
for RC2, so please file installation reports!
