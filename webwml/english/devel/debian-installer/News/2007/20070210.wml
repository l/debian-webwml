<p>
The expiry of the Debian archive's signing key for 2006 has broken most
of the installation media from etch RC1.

Final preparations have begun for the second release candidate of the 
Debian Installer for Etch, and we hope to get RC2 out as soon as possible
 to fix this.

<p>
The only images that should remain usable are the full installation CDs and DVDs,
when used without a network mirror.

<p>
In the meantime, if you need to use one of the other installation methods, use
the daily built images. This will also help us with pre-release testing for
RC2, so please file installation reports!
