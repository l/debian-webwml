<p>
The Debian Installer team is happy to announce that daily built images of
Debian Installer (for Lenny) now include experimental support for installing
Debian on systems configured with Serial ATA RAID <sup><a href="#n1">1)</a></sup>,
as supported in Linux by using the dmraid utility.
</p>

<p>
The support is experimental because
</p>
<ul>
  <li>it has not yet had very much testing;</li>
  <li>only the GRUB bootloader installer supports it, which effectively limits
      support to i386 and amd64;</li>
  <li>dmraid devices are currently not really supported by either libparted
     (partitioning) or any bootloaders; the current support in the installer
     works around this, but this results in some limitations in usability.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Users are invited to test this new feature of the installer.<br />
Installation instructions and an overview of limitations can be found on
the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SataRaid">Debian
Installer Wiki</a>. Please read that page carefully. Installer and CD images are
available from <a href="https://www.debian.org/devel/debian-installer/">the Debian
Installer website</a>; you will need one of the <q>daily built</q> images.<br />
Please report any issues by filing an <a href="http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">installation report</a>.
</p>

<p>
The support for Serial ATA RAID is scheduled to be included in the first 
Beta release of the installer for Lenny.

<li><a name="n1"></a>To confuse the general public, this is also referred
to as ATA RAID, BIOS RAID, fake RAID and software RAID, as well as a number
of vendor specific terms such as <q>Intel Matrix Storage</q>.</li>
