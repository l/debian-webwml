<p>
The Debian Installer <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Team">\
team</a> is proud to announce the second release candidate (RC2) of the installer
for Debian GNU/Linux Etch. Unless release critical issues are discovered, this
will be the version of the installer that will be included in the release of
Etch.
</p>

<p>
There are no real major changes in this release, but we have been able to use
the time since RC1 to fix quite a few important and minor issues.
</p>

<h2>Improvements in this release of the installer</h2>
<ul>
<li>This new version of the installer uses and installs the 2.6.18 kernel.</li>
<li>Resizing Windows Vista NTFS partitions is now supported.</li>
<li>Both the regular (newt frontend) and graphical (gtk frontend) installer
    now offer a theme using high-contrast colors and increased font size for
    visually impaired people. This theme can be activated by adding the
    parameter <tt>theme=dark</tt> when booting the installer.</li>
<li>There have been several important bug fixes and usability improvements in
    the graphical installer. Most importantly, it is now possible to switch
    consoles on amd64.<br />
    Information about the graphical installer and the most important differences
    between the graphical and regular installer has been added in an appendix in
    the installation guide.</li>
<li>In expert mode or by using preseeding it is possible to select the FTP
    protocol instead of HTTP to access a Debian mirror. The hostname of an
    FTP mirror can only be entered manually, selection from a list is not
    supported.</li>
<li>The time-out when searching for a security mirror has been reduced
    significantly. This may mean that a security mirror will not be found
    if the network connection is bad, but it also means that the time spent
    waiting if no security mirror is available at all is now acceptable.</li>
<li>It is now possible to blacklist a (driver) module by setting a special
    parameter when the installer is booted. This may help to work around
    buggy or conflicting kernel modules. See the installation guide for
    details.</li>
<li>Architecture specific:
    <ul>
    <li>arm: there have been
       <a href="http://www.cyrius.com/journal/2007/03/12#rc2-nslu2">several
       improvements</a> for the NSLU2:
        <ul>
	<li>the kernel now uses the Ethernet driver developed by Christian
	    Hohnstaedt</li>
	<li>the kernel also adds LED support and fixes real time clock support</li>
	<li>selection of the correct timezone during installation</li>
	</ul></li>
    <li>powerpc: RAID installation with macintosh partition tables should now
        work</li>
    <li>s390: most usability issues from RC1 have been fixed</li>
    </ul></li>
<li>The following additional languages are now supported:
    Belarusian, Kurdish;
    and only in the graphical installer:
    Georgian, Malayalam.</li>
</ul>

<h2>No longer supported as of this release</h2>
<ul>
<li>The boot parameter to enable the <q>auto mode</q> for preseeding has been
    changed from <tt>auto-install/enabled</tt> to
    <tt>auto-install/enable</tt> for consistency with rescue mode. The
    <tt>auto</tt> alias and boot option remain valid.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues in this release</h2>
<ul>
<li>The installer is currently not able to resize ext3 partitions that have
    the <tt>dir_index</tt> and/or <tt>resize_inode</tt> features enabled.
    This includes ext3 partitions created with the Etch installer.<br />
    It is possible to manually resize ext3 partitions from a shell during
    the installation.</li>
<li>The sky2 network driver is known to be broken in kernel version
    2.6.18.dfsg.1-11 and may cause kernel panics.
<li>There are still a few issues for some PowerPC subarchitectures.</li>
<li>For sparc32 CD-ROM support is broken in the esp kernel driver; use
    the netboot installation method instead.</li>
<li>Known issues for the graphical installer:
    <ul>
    <li>some non-US keymaps are not fully supported (deadkeys and combining
        characters do not work);</li>
    <li>touchpads should work, but support may not be optimal; if you experience
        problems, you should use an external mouse instead;</li>
    <li>limited support for creating encrypted partitions;</li>
    <li>should work on almost all PowerPC systems that have an ATI graphics
        card, but is unlikely to work on other PowerPC systems.</li>
    </ul></li>
</ul>

a full list of known issues.

<h2>New CD/DVD images</h2>
With this release of the installer, Debian also offers some new types of
CD/DVD images:
<ul>
<li>a full CD that installs a KDE desktop environment by default</li>
<li>a full CD that installs an Xfce desktop environment by default</li>
<li>a multi-architecture CD for i386/amd64/powerpc and one for
    alpha/hppa/ia64 that effectively behave like a netinst CD (the images
    contain the base system for all three architectures)</li>
<li>a multi-architecture DVD for i386/amd64/powerpc which also includes source
    packages; this makes the image ideal for promotion purposes at trade shows
    and other events</li>
</ul>

<p>
Our thanks to everybody who has contributed to this release. Special thanks
to Attilio Fiandrotti, the lead developer behind the graphical installer.
