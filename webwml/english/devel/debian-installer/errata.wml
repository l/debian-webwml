	<dt>CD1 without a network mirror isn't sufficient to install a full desktop environment.</dt>
	<dd>
	The default environment (GNOME) doesn't seem to suffer from this problem anymore.

	<dt>Network issues when installing a desktop over a wireless connection.</dt>
	<dd>
	When installing a desktop using a wireless connection, the
	network-manager component on the installed system might not be
	working out of the box
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/682608">#682608</a>). A
	workaround might be to comment out the lines about wlan0 in the
	/etc/network/interfaces file.

	<dt>Network apparently failing to come up post-install when installing a desktop environment.</dt>
	<dd>
	network-manager deactivates the configuration for the eth0 network
	interface in /etc/network/interfaces. The implementation of the script
	doing the adjustments is very naive and does not cope with the new
	privacy extension option set by netcfg. Hence, if network-manager got
	installed during installation, e.g. if the GNOME desktop environment
	or KDE desktop environment is selected, you need to comment out
	"privext 2" in /etc/network/interface post-install to silence warnings
	emitted by ifupdown during the boot process. The network will still be
	set up correctly by network-manager.

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
