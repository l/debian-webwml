<!-- 

New errata for the as-yet-unnamed new release:

<ul>
	<li><b>Partitioner may confuse identical sized partitions.</b>
	In some circumstances, the partitioner may confuse partitions on
	different disks that have the same size. Take care when working
	with such partitions that the partitioner is acting on the
	partition you told it to.</li>
	<li><b>At least 48 mb needed for S390 install.</b>
	On S390, your virtual machine must have 64M to install.
	</li>

<h1><a name="beta4">Errata for beta 4</a></h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in beta 4 of the Debian-Installer.
If you do not see your problem listed here, please send us an
<a href="report-template">installation report</a> describing the problem.
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Windows OS not detected.</b>
	The installer may fail to detect existing installations of Windows,
	if Windows uses an NTFS filesystem. It will not be added to the
	grub boot menu. (This problem is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Installs an insecure kernel.</b>
	The kernel used by the installer is vulnerable to a few
	security holes. We recommend you upgrade to a newer kernel after
	installing. In general, since debian-installer installs Debian's
	testing branch, the installed system may also be vulnerable to other
	security holes whose fixes have not yet reached testing.
	(This problem is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Module parameters are ignored.</b>
	In expert mode the installer prompts for parameters to pass to
	modules it loads. These parameters will be ignored due to a bug in
	modprobe. (This problem is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Problems with console switching with the 2.6 kernel.</b>
	In the installer version using the 2.6 kernel, screen corruption
	will result if you switch virtual consoles. This is only a problem
	during the install. If you need access to a shell during the install,
	go back to the main menu, and use the menu item to get a shell.
	(This problem is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Common alpha hardware unsupported.</b>
	Certain common alpha hardware is not supported by the version of
	the linux kernel shipped in this release candidate. This includes
	the qlogicisp driver, and de4x5 and tulip drivers with
	DECChip-based ethernet cards. (This problem should be fixed in the
	daily builds.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Problem with sparc support for Creator 3D and all SBUS and
	UPA framebuffer devices.</b>
	A <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/245620">bug</a> prevents the
	above-mentioned framebuffer devices from being usable in the
	installer. As a workaround, you can try to boot passing the
	parameter debian-installer/framebuffer=false to the kernel.
	</li>

	<li><b>Sparc CDROMs may not boot.</b>
	On some sparc machines, the CDROMs do not boot. Passing "devfs=mount
	rw" may work. Please report any successes or failures.
	(This is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Wrong kernel is installed for sparc32 systems.</b>
	2.4.24 kernels are no longer available for the SPARC
	architecture, only 2.4.26. The kernel installer in beta 4
	thus chooses the wrong 2.4.26 kernel for 32-bit SPARC architectures.
	(This problem is fixed in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>S390 architecture is not supported.</b>
	The S/390 architecture is the only Debian architecture not
	supported by this release. S390 installation images are provided,
	but serious hand-hacking will be necessary to do an install using
	them. S390 support is working in the daily builds.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Oldworld powerpc is not supported.</b>
	Support for oldworld powerpc machines is incomplete. No boot loader
	is installed, and there may be problems starting the installer.
	We recommend using the daily builds for oldworld powerpc, though
	there may still be some problems.
	</li>

	<li><b>Arabic and Hebrew display problems.</b>
	The installer does not have the BIDI support necessary for proper
	display of Arabic and Hebrew text. (This is fixed in the daily
	builds.)
	</li>

	<li><b>Partitioner is slow.</b>
	Our partitioning program is slow, especially on hppa. We hope
	to speed it up in a future release.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="beta3">Old errata for beta 3</a></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>powerpc keyboard configuration.</b>
	The powerpc installer will not allow you to configure your keyboard
	type during the first stage install. Fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>cdrom not added to fstab.</b>
	/etc/fstab will not contain an entry for your CD-ROM drive.
	Fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>

	<li><b>alpha cannot install from SCSI cdrom.</b>
	On the Dec Alpha architecture, installs from SCSI cdroms fail
	due to a kernel bug. As a workaround, use an IDE cdrom if you have
	one, or do a netboot installation.
	</li>

	<li><b>ia64 netboot installs broken.</b>
	The netboot install images for ia64 are missing some necessary
	kernel modules. This is fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>

	<li><b>ia64 USB keyboard unsupported.</b>
	USB keyboard support is broken on ia64. This problem is fixed in
	the daily builds.
	</li>

	<li><b>sparc CDs may not work.</b>
	The sparc CDs are known not to boot on all machines. They may or
	may not work, we appreciate your success or failure reports. It may
	help to pass "root=/dev/rd/0 rw" to the kernel while booting.
	Also, the sparc netinst CD is missing kernel images, so use the
	businesscard CD instead.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Arabic and Hebrew display problems.</b>
	The installer does not have the BIDI support necessary for proper
	display of Arabic and Hebrew text.
	</li>

	<li><b>Problems with some hardware RAID.</b>
	Installs will fail on some machines with hardware RAID, including
	DAC960 and cciss. This is fixed in the daily builds for DAC960 and
	at least some Compaq controllers.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="beta2">Old errata for beta 2</a></h1>
<ul>

	<li><b>Installs an insecure kernel on some architectures.</b>
	The kernel used by the installer is vulnerable to a few
	security holes, such as the
	<a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-403">do_brk() security hole</a>.
	We recommend you upgrade to a newer kernel after installing.
	In general, since debian-installer installs Debian's testing
	branch, the installed system may also be vulnerable to other
	security holes whose fixes have not yet propagated to testing.
        </li>

	<li><b>reiserfsprogs not installed.</b>
	While the installer can create reiserfs filesystems, the installed
	system is missing the reiserfsprogs package. It will boot and work
	ok, but you should install that package at your first opportunity.
	</li>

	<li><b>No prompt for hostname.</b>
	Certain types of installs may not prompt you for a hostname for
	the system, and a default hostname of "debian" will be used. You
	can change your hostname after the install by editing the
	<kbd>/etc/hostname</kbd> and <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> files. This does
	not affect installs from CD.
	</li>

	<li><b>USB Keyboard issues.</b>
	While the Debian-Installer should support USB keyboards, the
	keyboard will probably not be usable when you boot into the
	installed Debian system.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Base system configuration incomplete in French.</b>
	Due to a bug, installations in French will abort half way through
	configuration of the Debian base system. It will loop back to the
	introductory message.
	</li>

	<li><b>Base system configuration may be unusable in non-latin
	languages.</b>
	We have not finished our support for non-latin languages such as
	Japanese in the second stage of the installer. If you install using
	one of these languages, the display may be unreadable after the
	reboot.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="beta1">Old errata for beta 1</a></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>IDE CD-ROM not available after install.</b>
	Installs to a system with only SCSI hard drives, but an IDE CD-ROM
	will be unable to use the CD-ROM drive to install additional
	packages after the initial install and reboot. To fix the problem,
	just switch to a different virtual console, and modprobe ide-cd,
	then you can continue with installing packages. This problem is
	fixed in the latest daily builds.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to select mirror for download.</b>
	You may not be asked which Debian mirror to use, and the default 
	mirror in the United States may be slow from certain places in the
	world (such as Australia). If you need to choose a different mirror,
	boot the installer with <tt>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium</tt>.
	See the INSTALLATION-HOWTO for details. This problem is also fixed
	in the daily builds.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to do manual mirror entry.</b>
	Manual mirror entry does not work. If you need to use a local
	mirror, install using a daily build and not this beta.</li>

	<li><b>Problems with dual ethernet cards.</b>
	You will not be able to install over the network from a system that
	has two or more NICs. If you have such a system, use the daily
	builds instead of beta 1.</li>

	<li><b>SCSI CD-ROM installs require a driver floppy.</b>
	As is explained in the INSTALLATION-HOWTO, if your CD-ROM drive is
	SCSI, you must load a driver floppy before the installer will be
	able to use your CD-ROM drive. If you are unable to load a driver
	floppy, you will not be able to do a CD-ROM install of beta 1 of
	the Debian-Installer. Currently the only workaround is to use some
	other installation method, such as a netboot install.</li>

	<li><b>Cannot boot directly from a USB keychain.</b>
	Beta 1 of the installer does not support booting the installer
	directly from a USB keychain. As a workaround, follow the
	instructions for booting from a single floppy disc and then using
	the keychain. Or, try the daily builds, which do support direct
	boots from USB keychains, on modern hardware.</li>

	<li><b>Broken keyboard selection.</b>
	Some language choices may result in the incorrect keyboard being
	selected. (For example, Dvorak for Australian English). To avoid
	this problem, boot into medium priority mode with
	DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium at the boot prompt, and select the correct
	keyboard.</li>
</ul>
