	<dt>Other operating systems not added to grub's boot menu</dt>
	<dd>Other operating systems, such as Windows, are detected but in some 
	cases they're not added to grub's boot menu. As workaround, after 
	installing, run update-grub.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/666750">#666750</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608025">#608025</a>.

	<dt>Makes incompatible partition table with Mac OS 9</dt>
	<dd>It was reported that the partitioning tool in the installer makes 
	the partition table unrecognizable by Mac OS 9 which no longer boots.
	Although the HFS+ partitions are compatible with Linux and Mac OS X it 
	is advised to take all precautions when installing on a machine with 
	Mac OS 9.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/604134">#604134</a>.

	<dt>Partitioning fails on kFreeBSD</dt>
	<dd>
	There are reports of failing partitioning on kFreeBSD. 
	The problem seems to be related with partitions alignment / extended 
	partitions.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/593733">#593733</a>, 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/597088">#597088</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/602129">#602129</a>.

	<dt>Network/Graphic/Storage card doesn't work properly</dt>
	<dd>
	There is several hardware, notably network cards, graphic cards and 
	storage controllers, that require binary non-free firmware to work 
	properly.<br />
	Debian is commited to free software values and never make the system 
	require non-free software (see Debian's <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">
	Social Contract</a>). So, non-free firmware is not included in the 
	installer.<br />
	But if you want to load any external firmware during installation 
	you are free to do it. The process is documented in the installation manual.

	<dt>zipl installation problem that makes s390 uninstallable</dt>
	<dd>
	If a dedicated partition for the /boot directory is created system-boot
	fails after installation if /boot is mounted before /.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/519254">#519254</a>.

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.

	systems over 16TiB in size.
