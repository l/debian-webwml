<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Partitoning fails on kFreeBSD</dt>
	<dd>
	There are reports of failing partitioning on kFreeBSD. 
	The problem seems to be related with partitions alignment / extended 
	partitions.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/593733">#593733</a>, 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/597088">#597088</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/602129">#602129</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Hibernation doesn't work with swap on lvm</dt>
	<dd>
	Resuming from hibernation doesn't work if swap is on lvm. initramfs 
	doesn't recognize the uuid of the swap partition on 
	/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/568877">#568877</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Network/Graphic/Storage card doesn't work properly</dt>
	<dd>
	There is several hardware, notably network cards, graphic cards and 
	storage controllers, that require binary non-free firmware to work 
	properly.<br />
	Debian is commited to free software values and never make the system 
	require non-free software (see Debian's <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">
	Social Contract</a>). So, non-free firmware is not included in the 
	installer.<br />
	But if you want to load any external firmware during installation 
	you are free to do it. The process is documented in the installation manual.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>zipl installation problem that makes s390 uninstalable</dt>
	<dd>
	If created a dedicated partition for the /boot directory system-boot 
	fails after installation if /boot is mounted before /.<br/ >
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/519254">#519254</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>os-prober causes data corruption if filesystem is being
     used by another host</dt>
	<dd>
	os-prober causes data corruption on setups where filesystems are 
	already mounted on other hosts. This issue has been identified on 
	a SAN setup and on a virtual machine that uses an existing logical 
	volume.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/599203">#599203</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/556739">#556739</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Failed to install on powerpc NewWorld with added disk controller</dt>
	<dd>
	yaboot: failed to install boot loader with addon Promise card
	as disk controller on powerpc NewWorld.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/589701">#589701</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Speakup doesn't get automatically configured</dt>
	<dd>
	When installing with speakup enabled, speakup doesn't get 
	automatically configured on the installed system. Workaround:<br />
	when the installation is done at the "I'm finished, will reboot" 
	prompt swith to VT2 and type:
	<br />
	<tt>echo speakup_foobar >> /target/etc/modules</tt>
	<br />
	where foobar is replaced by the name of the desired speakup driver. Then
	come back to VT1 to let d-i finish and reboot.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Country names not properly sorted in English</dt>
	<dd>
	During mirror selection the list of country name is sorted by
	country codes instead of country names, which can make it difficult
	to find some countries on the list. This only affects installations
	in English.
	</dd>

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>

	<dt>Some USB keyboards may not work</dt>
	<dd>
	Some USB keyboards, like the Genius Comfy KB 16e, don't work with 
	current kernel.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/588742">#588742</a>. 
	</dd>
	<dt>i386: few issues</dt>
	<dd>
	The i386 port has some known issues in this release:
	<ul>
	<li>Due to an increase in the size of the kernel, we are unable
	to provide installation images for installs from floppy disk.</li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitions overs 16TiB not supported by ext4</dt>
	<dd>
	The ext4 file system creation tools do not support creating file
	systems over 16TiB in size.
	</dd>

	<dt>armel: root on RAID boot issue</dt>
	<dd>
	Please be aware that there is a problem if you choose to have root on RAID
	that will cause your machine not to start after installing Debian.
	Fortunately, there's a easy workaround: when the installer tells you that
	it's done and asks you whether you want to reboot, choose "Go back" and
	open a shell in the menu.  Then use nano to edit the file
	<tt>/target/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/flash_kernel_set_root</tt> and remove
	the check that ensures the root device exists.  Type exit, choose "Make the
	system bootable" and press okay at the "Installation complete" message.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: silo bootloader installation problem</dt>
	<dd>
	The silo bootloader is not correctly installed to the target system.
	Because of this the reboot will fail. See
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/565639">#565639</a> for details.
	Fixed in daily built images.
