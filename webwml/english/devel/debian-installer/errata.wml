<h1><a name="rc3">Errata for release candidate 3</a></h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the rc3 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem or
<a href="http://wiki.debian.net/?DebianInstallerBrokenThings">check the
wiki</a> for other known problems.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>JFS broken on ia64.</b>
	The JFS filesystem is broken when installing ia64 using the
	(default) 2.6 kernel. Either avoid using JFS on ia64, or use the
	2.4 kernel.
	</li>
	<li><b>Red screen at boot.</b>
	Sometimes the installer may come up with a red screen at boot when
	using the 2.6 kernel. The install and works fine, there is no error,
	but the screen background is just the wrong color, red, instead of
	blue. This is bug #<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/273192">273192</a>.
	</li>
	<li><b>SATA driver can block access to CD drive in installations
	from CD.</b>
	On systems having a SATA IDE controller that also has the CD drive
	connected to it, you may see the installer hanging during hardware
	detection for the CD drive or failing to read the CD just afterwards. A
	possible reason is that the SATA driver (ata_piix and maybe others) is
	blocking access to the CD drive.<br>
	You can try to work around this by booting the installer in expert mode
	and, in the "Detect and mount CD-ROM" step, selecting only the drivers
	needed for CD support. These are (ide-)generic, ide-cd and isofs.<br>
	The drivers needed to access the disk will still be loaded, but at a later
	stage. By loading the CD drivers before the SATA driver in this way, you
	may be able to complete the installation. Note that CD-ROM access may
	still be an issue after rebooting into the installed system.
	</li>
	<li><b>Installer fails to boot on some HP PA-RISC systems.</b>
	On some systems the ramdisk set up for the installer is too small by
	default. Booting the installer with parameter "ramdisk_size=21504" (or,
	if that also fails, a higher value) should solve this. This problem
	has so far been reported for HP9000-712/60 and HP715/100XC.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="rc2">Old errata for rc2</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>Sparc32 fails to install from CD.</b>
	Sparc32 systems will fail to install from CD due to a missing isofs
	kernel module. This is fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>
	<li><b>IA-64 2.6 USB keyboard problem.</b>
	The ia64 installer has a bug that prevents USB keyboards and other
	USB devices from working during the installation process, when the
	2.6 kernel is used. Use the 2.4 kernel as a workaround, or install
	from a daily build, or use a serial console or non-USB keyboard for
	the install.
	</li>
	<li><b>M68k amiga kernel missing.</b>
	The netinst iso doesn't include the kernel for amiga. This means the
        q40 kernel gets installed, no amiga modules get installed, and
        the reboot may fail or come up without a network or such. As a
	workaround, use a different iso, or other installation method for
	amiga. This is fixed on the daily CD images.
	</li>
	<li><b>Multi-user workstation partitioning scheme is unusable on alpha.</b>
	The partman partitioning tool has a bug that results 
	in a phantom 9th partition being added to the disk when using 
	this partitioning recipe.  This prevents the aboot bootloader 
	from installing with a complaint about overlapping partitions.  
	As a workaround, use a different guided partitioning profile or 
	partition your disk manually. This is fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>
	<li><b>Erased partition table on Sparc (at least).</b>
	On Sparc (and other machines with Sun disk label)
	users may <strong>not</strong> create swap space partitions, 
	or partitions for LVM or RAID, at the <em>beginning</em> of the 
	disk.  When users do this, the partition table resides in the 
	first partition and will be subsequently completely erased when 
	this partition is used.
	</li>
	<li><b>2.6 installer has the potential to mess up Windows partitioning.</b>
	The fixes of the 2.6 CHS issue in parted are apparently
	incomplete and some people have reported that Windows did not boot
	after they installed Debian. This does not seem to affect all
	systems, or even most systems, but we haven't enough data to be
	sure. If your Windows partition is important to you and you don't
	want to take the risk, do not use the "linux26" boot method for
	the installer, and install with a 2.4 kernel ("linux" boot method).
	You can always upgrade the installed kernel to 2.6 later. This
	problem is believed to be fixed in the daily builds.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="pre-rc2">Old errata for pre-rc2</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>CDROM mount points vanish at each boot</b>
	If your /media/cdrom mount point is removed each time you boot, you
	are experiencing <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/255103">a bug in
	discover1</a>. Run <tt>dpkg-reconfigure discover1</tt> and tell
	it not to manage your CDROM mount points. This is fixed in unstable
	and will soon be fixed in testing.
	</li>
	<li><b>Country selection fails for languages with only one
	country</b>
	Languages such as Japanese or Finnish that have only one country
	they're likely to be spoken in tickle a bug in the installer, which
	crashes after the language is selected. This is fixed in the daily
	builds.
	</li>
	<li><b>Leaves <tt>/.aptitude</tt> directory</b>
	The install accidentally leaves a <tt>/.aptitude</tt> in the root
	directory, rather than in root's home directory. This is fixed in
	newer versions of the installer, and the directory can be removed
	with no ill effects.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="rc1">Old errata for release candidate 1</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>Partitioner may confuse identical sized partitions.</b>
	In some circumstances, the partitioner may confuse partitions on
	different disks that have the same size. Take care when working
	with such partitions that the partitioner is acting on the
	partition you told it to. (This is fixed in the daily builds.)</li>

	<li><b>At least 64 mb needed for s390 install.</b>
	On s390, your virtual machine must have 64M to install.
	(This is dealt with in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Hotplug bugs lead to reboot loops, no display.</b>
	The version of hotplug installed by rc1 may try to load hardware
	watchdog modules that cause the system to reboot about 1 minute
	after they're loaded. Or it might load a frame buffer driver that
	makes the console unusable. To work around these problems, boot
	into emergency mode, and either add the unsafe modules (such as
	"i810-tco") to /etc/hotplug/blacklist, or disable/remove hotplug
	(warning: disabling hotplug may make USB keyboards unusable).
	These bugs are fixed in newer versions of hotplug.
	</li>

	<li><b>Broken sparc CD images.</b>
	The sparc netinst and full CD images are broken due to a problem
	with mkisofs. The businesscard CD is ok. We're working to produce
	fixed images. If "file" reports a large negative number of blocks
	on your ISO image, it's one of the bad ones and will not boot.
	</li>
</ul>
