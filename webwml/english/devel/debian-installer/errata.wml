	<dt>Installation of GRUB bootloader may fail if more than one disk device is available.</dt>
	<dd>When there is more than one disk available during installation
	(for example one hard disk and one USB stick, as it is commonly the case when
	booting the installer from a USB stick), <code>grub-install</code> may run into
	problems: it was reported several times, that the GRUB bootloader was
	installed onto the USB stick instead of the hard disk containing the newly-installed system.
	<br />
	To avoid running into this, make sure to answer <q>No</q> when the following question
	is asked during the installation process: <q>Install the GRUB boot loader to the
	master boot record?</q>; it should be possible to specify the right device at the
	next step: <q>Device for boot loader installation</q>.
	<br />
	If the installation finished successfully despite a wrong GRUB configuration, it should be
	possible to recover using the rescue mode of the installer: chroot into the root filesystem,
	mount any additional boot partition if applicable, and
	run <code>grub-install</code> with the proper device as parameter.
	<br />
	This issue will hopefully be fixed in the next Release Candidate.

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
