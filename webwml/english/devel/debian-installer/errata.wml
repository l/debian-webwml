	<dt>CD1 without a network mirror isn't sufficient to install a full desktop environment.</dt>

	This issue is currently being discussed.

	Unfortunately, espeakup's incomplete migration to multi-arch
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/682313">#682313</a>)
	was discovered too late in the Debian Installer release process, the
	bug fix will be available in the next Debian Installer release.

	<dt>Network issues when installing a desktop over a wireless connection.</dt>
	<dd>
	When installing a desktop using a wireless connection, the
	network-manager component on the installed system might not be
	working out of the box
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/682608">#682608</a>). A
	workaround might be to comment out the lines about wlan0 in the
	/etc/network/interfaces file.

	<dt>kfreebsd: grub-install may fail to find a GRUB drive.</dt>
	<dd>
	Changes in boot scripts led to /proc's being removed from the
	default fstab, and a fix is needed for GNU/kFreeBSD systems
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/637684">#637684</a>). It will
	be available in the next Debian Installer release.

	<dt>s390x: broken busybox.</dt>
	<dd>The s390x build of busybox is broken due to alignment issues
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/681760">#681760</a>).
	This means that installation of s390x with Debian Installer beta 1
	will fail. This issue will be fixed with the next Debian Installer
	release.</dd>

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
