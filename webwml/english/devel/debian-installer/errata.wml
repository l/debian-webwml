<h1 id="lenny-rc1">Errata for lenny release RC1</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the lenny RC1 release of
Debian Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Outdated Installation Guide on installation media</dt>
	<dd>
	The copy of the Installation Guide that's included on
        installation media is outdated. Users are suggested to use
        <a href="http://www.debian.org/releases/lenny/installmanual">the updated copy on the website</a>.
	</dd>
	<dt>Multiarch CD boots the AMD64 installer directly</dt>
	<dd>
	The multiarch CD doesn't show the boot menu but rather boots directly
        into the AMD64 installer (Bug #505243).
	</dd>
	<dt>Corrupted display of messages in Dzongkha installs</dt>
	<dd>
	When the password chosen for root and its confirmations do not
        patch, the display of screens that follow is garbled, during
        installs in Dzongkha language (broken display of italic
        font).
	</dd>
	<dt>Fallback languages not used as planned</dt>
	<dd>
	For some languages (namely Northern Sami and Wolof), a fallback
        language different from English should be used. However, only
        English is used as fallback for these language. Users choosing
	these languages, particularly Northern Sami will be
	presented with many screens in English.
	</dd>

	<dt>Disk devices may change on reboot</dt>
	<dd>
	On systems with multiple disk controllers, the kernel/udev may assign
	a different device node on reboot of the system than was used during
	installation due to difference in load order of drivers.<br />
	This can lead to failure to boot the system. In most cases this can be
	corrected by changing the bootloader configuration and /etc/fstab,
	possibly using the rescue mode of the installer.<br />
	Note however that this problem may occur again on subsequent boots.
	</dd>

	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>
-->

	<dt>i386: no installation from floppy disk</dt>
	<dd>
	Due to an increase in the size of the 2.6.24 kernel, we are unable
	to provide installation images for installs from floppy disk. We
	expect to be able to support floppy installs again when the installer
	switches to the next kernel version.
	</dd>

	<dt>powerpc: various issues</dt>
	<dd>
	The PowerPC port has several issues in this release:
	<ul>
		<li>installation from floppy on OldWorld PowerMac is broken
		    because no device node is created for the swim3 module
		    and as miboot is not included</li>
		<li>the snd-powermac module is no longer loaded by default as
		    it will lock up some systems; you will need to add it to
		    <tt>/etc/modules</tt> manually</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: fails to recognize ESP/FAS SCSI controller</dt>
	<dd>
	Installer images are missing the <tt>sun_esp</tt> kernel module
	which is needed to support CD and disc drives connected to an ESP or
	FAS controller.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
		<li>support for LCS network interfaces is no longer available</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>
