<h1 id="etch-beta2">Errata for etch beta 2</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the etch beta 2 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>Network and disk devices may change on reboot</b><br>
	On systems with multiple disk or network controllers, the kernel/udev
	may assign a different device node on reboot of the system than was
	used during installation due to difference in load order of drivers.<br>
	This can lead to failure to boot the system or to the network not
	coming up automatically. In most cases this can be rectified changing
	the bootloader configuration and /etc/fstab, or /etc/network/interfaces,
	possibly using the rescue mode of the installer.<br>
	Note however that this problem may occur again on subsequent boots.
	Fixing is issue has priority for the next release of Debian installer.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Issues during package installation for some languages</b><br>
	Languages that have not been set to use UTF-8 by default will see
	garbled text during package installation because of character encoding
	problems (mojibake). This is a known issue for installations in Russian.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>General issues after reboot because of UTF-8 default</b><br>
	The installed system is now set to UTF-8 by default. However, not all
	applications properly support UTF-8 yet, which may result in minor or
	major problems when using them.<br>
	Please check if such problems have been reported yet and, if not, file
	a bug report against the relevant package (not the installer).
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Limited localization of installed system</b><br>
	For the Sarge version of the installer the package localization-config was
	responsible for part of the localization of the installed system. This
	package ran as part of base-config, which has been dropped in the release.
	Adapting localization-config to run before the reboot is on our TODO list,
	but meanwhile some localization may not be done automatically when
	installing in languages other than English.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Installation of Sarge not supported</b><br>
	As a result of some structural changes in this release of the installer,
	installation of Sarge (stable) is not supported. We expect to make this
	possible again in the next release.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>CD-ROM drives connected to SATA controllers not detected</b><br>
	Cause for the drives not being detected is that libata ATAPI support
	is not enabled in the kernel as the upstream kernel developers do not
	yet consider it mature. It is expected to be enabled in 2.6.16 kernels.<br>
	A <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=345999;msg=75">
	workaround is available</a> that will allow users to enable ATAPI
	support manually for the installation and the installed system. For
	details see also the other posts to that
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/345999">installation report</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>Several issues for PowerPC</b><br>
	The PowerPC port has several issues in this release:
	<ul>
		<li>support for prep partitions in partman is broken</li>
		<li>tg3 driver not available during installation</li>
		<li>floppy installations for powerpc are broken because no
		    device node is created for the swim3 module</li>
	        <li>Oldworld powerpc boot floppies will not work as miboot
		    is not included</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>arm: CATS cdrom images missing essential drivers</b><br>
	Please use netboot or daily (sid_d-i) images instead.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>i386: netinst iso too large for USB stick installs</b><br>
	The netinst iso is too large to fit on a 128 mb USB stick. It will
	work as a regular CD image or on larger USB sticks for a USB
	install.
	</li>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<li>
	<b>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</b><br>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>mips: installations via SSH broken for Cobalt</b><br>
	This was going to be a new feature for the release, but a bug was
	discovered at the last minute. A fixed image is available for
	<a href="http://people.debian.org/~tbm/cobalt/etch-beta2/nfsroot.tar.gz">download</a>.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc: 2.4 netboot images need special parameter to boot</b><br>
	The netboot image needs to be passed ramdisk_size=16000 to boot the 2.4
	kernel properly.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc32: 2.6 kernel not supported</b><br>
	Only the 2.4 kernel works with the sparc32 subarchitecture.
	</li>
</ul>
