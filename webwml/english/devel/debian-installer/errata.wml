<h1 id="squeeze-rc2">Errata for squeeze release candidate 2</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the squeeze release candidate 2 of
the Debian Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Potential installation problems with RTL8169-based network cards</dt>
	<dd>The Debian installer may be unable to use network cards based 
	on the RTL8169 family during the installation, which includes 
	downloading packages during installation through these cards. 
	The installed system is unaffected by the problem.<br /> 
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/558316">#558316</a> and similar merged bugs.<br />
	This will be fixed on the next Squeeze point release (6.0.1).
	</dd>

	<dt>
	Fails to boot after successful install on a btrfs root</dt>
	<dd>The installation finishes as normal, but after reboot it results 
	into an initramfs busybox prompt.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608538">#608538</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Windows is not added to the grub list<dt>
	<dd>
	The Debian Installer detects Windows during installation but 
	it not adds it to the grub boot menu. As workaround, after installing, 
	run update-grub.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/608025">#608025</a>.
	</dd>

	<dt>Makes incompatible partition table with MacOS 9</dt>
	<dd>It was reported that the partitioning tool in the installer makes 
	the partition table unrecognizable by MacOS 9 which no longer boots.
	Although the HFS+ partitions are compatible with Linux and MacOS X it 
	is advised to take all precautions when installing on a machine with 
	MacOS 9.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/604134">#604134</a>.	
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitioning fails on kFreeBSD</dt>
	<dd>
	There are reports of failing partitioning on kFreeBSD. 
	The problem seems to be related with partitions alignment / extended 
	partitions.<br />
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/593733">#593733</a>, 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/597088">#597088</a> and 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/602129">#602129</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Network/Graphic/Storage card doesn't work properly</dt>
	<dd>
	There is several hardware, notably network cards, graphic cards and 
	storage controllers, that require binary non-free firmware to work 
	properly.<br />
	Debian is commited to free software values and never make the system 
	require non-free software (see Debian's <a href="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">
	Social Contract</a>). So, non-free firmware is not included in the 
	installer.<br />
	But if you want to load any external firmware during installation 
	you are free to do it. The process is documented in the installation manual.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>zipl installation problem that makes s390 uninstalable</dt>
	<dd>
	If created a dedicated partition for the /boot directory system-boot 
	fails after installation if /boot is mounted before /.<br/ >
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/519254">#519254</a>.
	</dd>
	
	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>
	
<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitions overs 16TiB not supported by ext4</dt>
	<dd>
	The ext4 file system creation tools do not support creating file
	systems over 16TiB in size.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
