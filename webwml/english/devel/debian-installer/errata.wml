This is a list of known problems in the <humanversion /> release of the Debian
Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here, please send us an

	<dt>Installation of GRUB bootloader may fail if more than one disk device is available.</dt>
	<dd>When there is more than one disk available during installation
	(for example one hard disk and one USB stick, as it is commonly the case when
	booting the installer from a USB stick), <code>grub-install</code> may run into
	problems: it was reported several times, that the GRUB bootloader was
	installed onto the USB stick instead of the hard disk containing the newly-installed system.
	<br />
	To avoid running into this, make sure to answer <q>No</q> when the following question
	is asked during the installation process: <q>Install the GRUB boot loader to the
	master boot record?</q>; it should be possible to specify the right device at the
	next step: <q>Device for boot loader installation</q>.
	<br />
	If the installation finished successfully despite a wrong GRUB configuration, it should be
	possible to recover using the rescue mode of the installer: chroot into the root filesystem,
	mount any additional boot partition if applicable (like <code>/boot</code> and/or
	<code>/boot/efi</code> for an EFI system, see <code>/etc/fstab</code>), and
	run <code>grub-install</code> with the proper device as parameter.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> This issue will hopefully be fixed in the second Wheezy point release.
	</dd>

	<dt>Desktop installations on i386 do not work using CD#1 alone</dt>
	<dd>Due to space constraints on the first CD, not all of the expected GNOME desktop
	packages fit on CD#1. For a successful installation, use extra package sources (e.g.
	a second CD or a network mirror) or use a DVD instead.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> It is unlikely more efforts can be made to fit more packages on CD#1.
	</dd>

	<dt>Potential issues with UEFI booting on amd64</dt>
	<dd>There have been some reports of issues booting the Debian Installer in UEFI mode
	on amd64 systems. Some systems apparently do not boot reliably using <code>grub-efi</code>, and some
	others show graphics corruption problems when displaying the initial installation splash
	screen.
	<br />
	If you encounter either of these issues, please file a bug report and give as much detail
	as possible, both about the symptoms and your hardware - this should assist the team to fix
	these bugs. As a workaround for now, try switching off UEFI and installing using <q>Legacy
	BIOS</q> or <q>Fallback mode</q> instead.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> More bug fixes might appear in the various Wheezy point releases.
	</dd>

	<dt>Erroneous firmware prompt with some Intel Wireless cards</dt>

	<dd>If you have an Intel Wireless 6005 or 6205 card then the installer will
	prompt for the firmware file <code>iwlwifi-6000g2a-6.ucode</code>.
	This file is not included in the <code>firmware-iwlwifi</code> package and is not actually
	needed.  You must answer <code>no</code> to continue with installation.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> This issue is fixed in the first Wheezy point release.
	</dd>

	<dt>Missing beep at installer startup</dt>

	<dd>For accessibility reasons, a beep should be emitted when
	the installer’s bootloader is waiting for input. Unfortunately,
	a bug made it disappear in the first Wheezy Alpha release, and that
	was only reported right before the third Wheezy Release Candidate.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> This issue is fixed in the first Wheezy point release.
	</dd>

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
