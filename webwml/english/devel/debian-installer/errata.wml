<h1 id="etch-beta1">Errata for etch beta 1</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the etch beta 1 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<p>
Note: The errata for the graphical installer are listed separately
below.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>netinst iso too large</b><br>
	The netinst iso is too large to fit on a 128 mb USB stick. It will
	work as a regular CD image or on larger USB sticks for a USB
	install.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</b><br>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc: drivers for sbus devices not loaded automatically</b><br>
	Due to a bug in discover, drivers for devices on the sbus will not
	be loaded automatically
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/339565">#339565</a>). To load the
	needed kernel module(s) manually, use the modprobe command from VT2.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc: 2.4 incorrectly enters lowmem mode</b><br>
	Due to a bug in the installer when running with the sparc 2.4
	kernel, it will enter low memory mode on all systems, no matter the
	amount of free memory. We recommend using the 2.6 kernel instead if
	possible.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc: 2.4 netboot image needs special parameter to boot</b><br>
	The netboot image needs to be passed ramdisk_size=16000 to boot the 2.4
	kernel properly.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>oldworld powerpc: floppies not bootable</b><br>
	The oldworld powerpc boot floppies will not work as miboot is not
	included.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>s390: Not supported</b><br>
	The s390 architecture is not included in this release due to lack
	of support in parted.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc32: 2.6 kernel not supported</b><br>
	Only the 2.4 kernel works with the sparc32 subarchitecture.
	</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="etch-beta1-gtk">Errata for alpha release of the graphical installer</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>graphical installer is alpha quality</b><br>
	The graphical installer included in this release is alpha quality,
	with known bugs and limitations. Use at your own risk. The graphical
	installer requires at least 92 MB memory to run.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>hangs in final step of installation</b><br>
	During the step "Finish installation", the installer will hang when trying
	to unmount all filesystems. You can work around this by switching to VT2
	(using ctrl-alt-F2) and entering the command 'reboot'.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>executing a shell and switching consoles</b><br>
	The option "Execute a shell" in the main menu does not work in the graphical
	installer. There is also a problem with switching consoles while the
	graphical frontend is busy. To work around this, make sure the graphical
	frontend is waiting for input and only then switch consoles to VT2, VT3 or VT4.
	VT2 gives access to a shell. The graphical frontend is on VT5.
	</li>
</ul>
