	<dt>Network issues when installing a desktop over a wireless connection.</dt>
	<dd>
	When installing a desktop using a wireless connection, the
	network-manager component on the installed system might not be
	working out of the box
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/682608">#682608</a>). A
	workaround might be to comment out the lines about wlan0 in the
	/etc/network/interfaces file.

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
