<h1>Errata for beta 3</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in beta 2 of the Debian-Installer. If
you do not see your problem listed here, please send us an 
<a href="report-template">installation report</a> describing the problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>powerpc airport wifi not autodetected</b>
	The installer may fail to detect airport wifi interfaces on powerpc
	systems. Manually modprobe airport to get around this.
	
	<li><b>alpha cannot install from SCSI cdrom</b>
	On the Dec Alpha architecture, installs from SCSI cdroms fail
	due to a kernel bug. As a workaround, use an IDE cdrom if you have
	one, or do a netboot installation.
	</li>

	<li><b>Arabic and Hebrew display problems</b>
	The installer does not have the BIDI support necessary for proper
	display of Arabic and Hebrew text.
	</li>
		
</ul>

<h1><a name="beta2">Old errata for beta 2</a></h1>
<ul>

	<li><b>Installs an insecure kernel on some architectures.</b>
	The kernel used by the installer is vulnerable to a few
	security holes, such as the
	<a href="$(HOME)/security/2003/dsa-403">do_brk() security hole</a>.
	We recommend you upgrade to a newer kernel after installing.
	In general, since debian-installer installs Debian's testing
	branch, the installed system may also be vulnerable to other
	security holes whose fixes have not yet propagated to testing.
        </li>

	<li><b>reiserfsprogs not installed.</b>
	While the installer can create reiserfs filesystems, the installed
	system is missing the reiserfsprogs package. It will boot and work
	ok, but you should install that package at your first opportunity.
	</li>

	<li><b>No prompt for hostname.</b>
	Certain types of installs may not prompt you for a hostname for
	the system, and a default hostname of "debian" will be used. You
	can change your hostname after the install by editing the
	<kbd>/etc/hostname</kbd> and <kbd>/etc/hosts</kbd> files. This does
	not affect installs from CD.
	</li>

	<li><b>USB Keyboard issues.</b>
	While the Debian-Installer should support USB keyboards, the
	keyboard will probably not be usable when you boot into the
	installed Debian system.
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Base system configuration incomplete in French.</b>
	Due to a bug, installations in French will abort half way through
	configuration of the Debian base system. It will loop back to the
	introductory message.
	</li>

	<li><b>Base system configuration may be unusable in non-latin
	languages.</b>
	We have not finished our support for non-latin languages such as
	Japanese in the second stage of the installer. If you install using
	one of these languages, the display may be unreadable after the
	reboot.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="beta1">Old errata for beta 1</a></h1>
<ul>
	<li><b>IDE CD-ROM not available after install.</b>
	Installs to a system with only SCSI hard drives, but an IDE CD-ROM
	will be unable to use the CD-ROM drive to install additional
	packages after the initial install and reboot. To fix the problem,
	just switch to a different virtual console, and modprobe ide-cd,
	then you can continue with installing packages. This problem is
	fixed in the latest daily builds.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to select mirror for download.</b>
	You may not be asked which Debian mirror to use, and the default 
	mirror in the United States may be slow from certain places in the
	world (such as Australia). If you need to choose a different mirror,
	boot the installer with <tt>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium</tt>.
	See the INSTALLATION-HOWTO for details. This problem is also fixed
	in the daily builds.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to do manual mirror entry.</b>
	Manual mirror entry does not work. If you need to use a local
	mirror, install using a daily build and not this beta.</li>

	<li><b>Problems with dual ethernet cards.</b>
	You will not be able to install over the network from a system that
	has two or more NICs. If you have such a system, use the daily
	builds instead of beta 1.</li>

	<li><b>SCSI CD-ROM installs require a driver floppy.</b>
	As is explained in the INSTALLATION-HOWTO, if your CD-ROM drive is
	SCSI, you must load a driver floppy before the installer will be
	able to use your CD-ROM drive. If you are unable to load a driver
	floppy, you will not be able to do a CD-ROM install of beta 1 of
	the Debian-Installer. Currently the only workaround is to use some
	other installation method, such as a netboot install.</li>

	<li><b>Cannot boot directly from a USB keychain.</b>
	Beta 1 of the installer does not support booting the installer
	directly from a USB keychain. As a workaround, follow the
	instructions for booting from a single floppy disc and then using
	the keychain. Or, try the daily builds, which do support direct
	boots from USB keychains, on modern hardware.</li>

	<li><b>Broken keyboard selection.</b>
	Some language choices may result in the incorrect keyboard being
	selected. (For example, Dvorak for Australian English). To avoid
	this problem, boot into medium priority mode with
	DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium at the boot prompt, and select the correct
	keyboard.</li>
</ul>
