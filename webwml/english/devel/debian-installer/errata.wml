<h1 id="etch-beta3">Errata for etch beta 3</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the etch beta 3 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Disk devices may change on reboot</dt>
	<dd>
	On systems with multiple diskcontrollers, the kernel/udev may assign
	a different device node on reboot of the system than was used during
	installation due to difference in load order of drivers.<br />
	This can lead to failure to boot the system. In most cases this can be
	rectified changing the bootloader configuration and /etc/fstab,
	possibly using the rescue mode of the installer.<br />
	Note however that this problem may occur again on subsequent boots.
	Fixing this issue has priority for the next release of Debian installer.
	</dd>

	<dt>Danger of data loss from resizing partitions</dt>
	<dd>
	Partition resizing using partman may result in data loss if the
	starting sector of the partition is not at the start of a cylinder.
	See bug report <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/379835">#379835</a>
	for a detailed analysis.<br />
	This has been observed in particular for NTFS partitions created
	during installation of Windows Vista Beta 2. Resizing of NTFS
	partitions created by earlier Windows versions should still work.
	</dd>

	<dt>CD-ROM drives connected to SATA controllers not detected</dt>
	<dd>
	Cause for the drives not being detected is that libata ATAPI support
	is not enabled in the kernel as the upstream kernel developers do not
	yet consider it mature. It is expected to be enabled in 2.6.16 kernels.<br />
	A <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/SataAtapiHowto">\
	workaround is available</a> that will allow users to enable ATAPI
	support manually for the installation and the installed system.
	</dd>

	<dt>Incomplete installation of Desktop task from full CD</dt>
	<dd>
	The full CD image is too small to contain all packages needed to
	install the complete Desktop task. This means that if you only use the
	CD as a source, only part of the Desktop task will be installed.<br />
	You can resolve this either <em>during the installation</em> by choosing
	to use a network mirror as a source to install packages in addition to the
	CD (not recommended if you don't have a decent internet connection), or
	<em>after you have rebooted</em> into the installed system by using
	<tt>apt-cdrom</tt> to load additional CDs and then selecting the Desktop
	task again in <tt>aptitude</tt>.
	</dd>

	<dt>General issues after reboot because of UTF-8 default</dt>
	<dd>
	The installed system is now set to UTF-8 by default. However, not all
	applications properly support UTF-8 yet, which may result in minor or
	major problems when using them.<br />
	Please check if such problems have been reported yet and, if not, file
	a bug report against the relevant package (not the installer).
	</dd>

	<dt>Limited localization of installed system</dt>
	<dd>
	For the Sarge version of the installer the package localization-config was
	responsible for part of the localization of the installed system. This
	package ran as part of base-config, which has been dropped in the release.
	Adapting localization-config to run before the reboot is on our TODO list,
	but meanwhile some localization may not be done automatically when
	installing in languages other than English.
	</dd>

	<dt>Installation of Sarge not supported</dt>
	<dd>
	As a result of some structural changes in the installer, installation of
	Sarge (stable) is not supported.
	</dd>

	<dt>Several issues for PowerPC</dt>
	<dd>
	The PowerPC port has several issues in this release:
	<ul>
		<li>floppy installations for powerpc are broken because no
		    device node is created for the swim3 module</li>
		<li>Oldworld powerpc boot floppies will not work as miboot
		    is not included</li>
		<li>Airport Extreme driver is reported to be broken in 2.6.16
		    (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/358833">#358833</a>)</li>
		<li>the snd-powermac module is no longer loaded by default as
		    it will lock up some systems; you will need to add it to
		    <tt>/etc/modules</tt> manually</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>
-->

	<dt>amd64: [graphical installer] console switching not possible</dt>
	<dd>
	If you try to switch to a different console from the graphical installer
	on amd64, the frontend will crash. This means there is no shell available
	during the installation. Logs can be viewed using the <q>Save debug logs</q>
	option from the main menu.
	</dd>

	<dt>ia64: Fails to install initramfs-tools during base system installation</dt>
	<dd>
	Due to an internal misconfiguration, the installation will fail when it
	tries to install the kernel; please use a daily built image instead.
	</dd>

	<dt>mipsel/cobalt: error in network boot configuration</dt>
	<dd>
	The release provides for mipsel/cobalt a set of files for booting
	over network. The kernel image name is vmlinux-2.6.16-2-r5k-cobalt,
	but <tt>default.colo</tt> still records vmlinux-2.6.16-1-r5k-cobalt.<br />
	As a workaround, edit the file <tt>default.colo</tt> in the NFS root
	to expect vmlinux-2.6.16-2-r5k-cobalt as kernel file name.
	</dd>

	<dt>mips: keyboard does not work on SGI Indy</dt>
	<dd>
	The keyboard does not work after the installer is booted. This is probably
	a kernel issue. Installation over serial console should still be possible.
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: CD installs for sparc32 fail because of missing isofs module</dt>
	<dd>
	Unfortunately this was only discovered after the release; please use a
	daily built image instead. CD installs for sparc64 are not affected.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: usability issues</dt>
	<dd>
	Various components were rewritten in order to support 2.6 based
	installations and still have a few rough edges:
	<ul>
	<li>during network device selection, devices that have already been
	    selected are not removed from the list of available devices</li>
	<li>during dasd selection, the dialog does not show which dasds have
	    already been selected and which not</li>
	<li>the dasd selection component does not yet support formatting a new
	    dasd; use <tt>dasdfmt</tt> from a shell as a workaround</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>
