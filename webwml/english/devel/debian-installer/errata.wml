	<dt>Installation of grub bootloader may fail if more than one disc device is available.</dt>
	<dd>When there is more than one disc available during installation               
	(for example one hard disc and one USB stick, as it is commonly the case when  
	booting the installer from a USB stick), <code>grub-install</code> may run into           
	problems: it was reported several times, that the grub bootloader was        
	installed onto the usbstick instead of the hard disc, where the rest of       
	the system was installed.                                                    
	In such cases it is possible to resolve the situation like this:             
	boot into the rescue mode of the installer, chroot into your root filesystem,
	mount any additional boot partition you may have (if you have such), and     
	run grub-install again.                                                      
	A solution for this is already on the way (crossing fingers).

	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
