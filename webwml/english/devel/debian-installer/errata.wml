<p>
This is a list of known problems in beta 1 of the Debian Installer, with
workarounds. If you do not see your problem listed here, please send us
an <a href="report-template">installation report</a> describing the
problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>IDE CD-ROM not available after install</b>
	Installs to a system with only SCSI hard drives, but an IDE CD-ROM
	will be unable to use the CD-ROM drive to install additional
	packages after the initial install and reboot. To fix the problem,
	just switch to a different virtual console, and modprobe ide-cd,
	then you can continue with installing packages.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to select mirror for download</b>
	You may not be asked which Debian mirror to use, and the default 
	mirror in the United States may be slow from certian places in the
	world (such as Australia). If you need to choose a different mirror,
	boot the installer with <tt>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium</tt>.
	See the INSTALLATION-HOWTO for details.</li>
</ul>
