<p>
This is a list of known problems in beta 1 of the Debian Installer, with
workarounds. If you do not see your problem listed here, please send us
an <a href="report-template">installation report</a> describing the
problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>IDE CD-ROM not available after install</b>
	Installs to a system with only SCSI hard drives, but an IDE CD-ROM
	will be unable to use the CD-ROM drive to install additional
	packages after the initial install and reboot. To fix the problem,
	just switch to a different virtual console, and modprobe ide-cd,
	then you can continue with installing packages.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to select mirror for download</b>
	You may not be asked which Debian mirror to use, and the default 
	mirror in the United States may be slow from certian places in the
	world (such as Australia). If you need to choose a different mirror,
	boot the installer with <tt>DEBCONF_PRIORITY=medium</tt>.
	See the INSTALLATION-HOWTO for details.</li>

	<li><b>Unable to do manual mirror entry</b>
	Manual mirror entry does not work. If you need to use a local
	mirror, install using a daily build and not this beta.</li>

	<li><b>Problems with dual ethernet cards</b>
	You will not be able to install over the network from a system that
	has two or more NICs. If you have such a system, use the daily
	builds instead of beta 1.</li>

	<li><b>SCSI CD-ROM installs require a driver floppy</b>
	As is explained in the INSTALLATION-HOWTO, if your CD-ROM drive is
	SCSI, you must load a driver floppy before the installer will be
	able to use your CD-ROM drive. If you are unable to load a driver
	floppy, you will not be able to do a CD-ROM install of beta 1 of
	the Debian installer. Currently the only workaround is to use some
	other installation method, such as a netboot install.</li>

	<li><b>Cannot boot directly from a USB keychain</b>
	Beta 1 of the installer does not support booting the installer
	directly from a USB keychain. As a workaround, follow the
	instructions for booting from a single floppy disc and then using
	the keychain. Or, try the daily builds, which do support direct
	boots from USB keychains, on modern hardware.</li>
</ul>
