<h1 id="lenny-beta2">Errata for lenny release beta2</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the lenny Beta2 release of
Debian Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Disk devices may change on reboot</dt>
	<dd>
	On systems with multiple disk controllers, the kernel/udev may assign
	a different device node on reboot of the system than was used during
	installation due to difference in load order of drivers.<br />
	This can lead to failure to boot the system. In most cases this can be
	corrected by changing the bootloader configuration and /etc/fstab,
	possibly using the rescue mode of the installer.<br />
	Note however that this problem may occur again on subsequent boots.
	</dd>

	<dt><q>uninitialized value</q> warnings from Perl during installation</dt>
	<dd>
	As a result of a recent switch to Perl 5.10, the installation logs
	will show some Perl warnings. As far as we know these are harmless
	and can be ignored. A solution for this issue
	(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/480533">#480533</a>) is being worked on.
	</dd>

	<dt>aptitude errors during installs in Russian</dt>
	<dd>
	This issue will result in a failed installation. We have only seen
	reports for Russian, but some other languages may be affected too.
	The issue (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/473559">#473559</a>) is
	expected to be fixed shortly after the release for daily and weekly built
	installer and CD/DVD images.
	</dd>

	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>

	<dt>General issues after reboot because of UTF-8 default</dt>
	<dd>
	The installed system is now set to UTF-8 by default. However, not all
	applications properly support UTF-8 yet, which may result in minor or
	major problems when using them.<br />
	Please check if such problems have been reported yet and, if not, file
	a bug report against the relevant package (not the installer).
	</dd>

	<dt>Graphical installer</dt>
	<dd>
	The graphical installer still has some known issues (see also the
	Installation Guide):
	<ul>
		<li>some non-US keymaps are not fully supported (deadkeys and
		    combining characters do not work)</li>
		<li>keys for accented or special characters may not work correctly;
		    this is a regression compared to previous releases which will
		    hopefully be fixed again soon
		    (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/482335">#482335</a>)</li>
		<li>touchpads should work, but support may not be optimal; if you
		    experience problems, you should use an external mouse instead</li>
		<li>should work on almost all PowerPC systems that have an ATI
		    graphics card, but is unlikely to work on other PowerPC
		    systems</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>
-->

	<dt>i386: no installation from floppy disk</dt>
	<dd>
	Due to an increase in the size of the 2.6.24 kernel, we are unable
	to provide installation images for installs from floppy disk. We
	expect to be able to support floppy installs again when the installer
	switches to the next kernel version.
	</dd>

	<dt>i386/amd64: GRUB installation on cpqarray RAID volumes may fail</dt>
	<dd>
	Affected are systems that have <tt>/dev/ida/cXdX</tt> devices.
	This issue (<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/466600">#466600</a>) is
	expected to be fixed soon after the release for daily and weekly built
	installer and CD/DVD images when a fixed version of GRUB reaches testing.
	</dd>

	<dt>powerpc: various issues</dt>
	<dd>
	The PowerPC port has several issues in this release:
	<ul>
		<li>installation from floppy on OldWorld PowerMac is broken
		    because no device node is created for the swim3 module
		    and as miboot is not included</li>
		<li>the snd-powermac module is no longer loaded by default as
		    it will lock up some systems; you will need to add it to
		    <tt>/etc/modules</tt> manually</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
		<li>support for LCS network interfaces is no longer available</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>
