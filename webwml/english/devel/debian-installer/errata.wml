<h1 id="squeeze-alpha1">Errata for squeeze release alpha 1</h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the squeeze alpha 1 release of
Debian Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<dl class="gloss">
	<dt>Auto-assembly of RAID arrays in rescue mode can corrupt data</dt>
	<dd>
		Rescue mode should be used with great care when software RAID
		arrays were in use on the system to rescue. The rescue mode scripts
		automatically assemble arrays, which could lead to data corruption in
		the presence of invalid or obsolete RAID superblocks.
		Fixed in daily built images.
	</dd>
	<dt>Buggy routers may cause network problems</dt>
	<dd>
	If you experience network problems during the installation, this may be
	caused by a router somewhere between you and the Debian mirror that
	doesn't correctly handle window scaling.
	See <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/401435">#401435</a> and this
	<a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/6723">kerneltrap article</a> for
	details.<br />
	You can work around this issue by disabling TCP window scaling. Activate
	a shell and enter the following command:<br />
	<tt>echo 0 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_window_scaling</tt><br />
	For the installed system you should probably not completely disable TCP
	window scaling. The following command will set ranges for reading and
	writing that should work with almost any router:<br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_rmem</tt><br />
	<tt>echo 4096 65536 65536 &gt;/proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_wmem</tt>
	</dd>
	<dt>Country names not properly sorted in English</dt>
	<dd>
	During mirror selection the list of country name is sorted by
	country codes instead of country names, which can make it difficult
	to find some countries on the list. This only affects installations
	in English.
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</dd>

	<dt>Some USB keyboards may not work</dt>
	<dd>
	Some USB keyboards require specific kernel modules for proper
	support. Those are missing in current installer. See 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/561036">#561036</a>, 
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/567431">#567431</a>.
	Fixed in daily built images.
	</dd>
	<dt>i386: few issues</dt>
	<dd>
	The i386 port has some known issues in this release:
	<ul>
	<li>Due to an increase in the size of the kernel, we are unable
	to provide installation images for installs from floppy disk.</li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>Partitions overs 16TiB not supported by ext4</dt>
	<dd>
	The ext4 file system creation tools do not support creating file
	systems over 16TiB in size.
	</dd>

	<dt>armel: root on RAID boot issue</dt>
	<dd>
	Please be aware that there is a problem if you choose to have root on RAID
	that will cause your machine not to start after installing Debian.
	Fortunately, there's a easy workaround: when the installer tells you that
	it's done and asks you whether you want to reboot, choose "Go back" and
	open a shell in the menu.  Then use nano to edit the file
	<tt>/target/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/flash_kernel_set_root</tt> and remove
	the check that ensures the root device exists.  Type exit, choose "Make the
	system bootable" and press okay at the "Installation complete" message.
	</dd>

	<dt>s390: unsupported features</dt>
	<dd>
	<ul>
		<li>support for the DASD DIAG discipline is currently not
		    available</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>

	<dt>sparc: silo bootloader installation problem</dt>
	<dd>
	The silo bootloader is not correctly installed to the target system.
	Because of this the reboot will fail. See
	<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/565639">#565639</a> for details.
	Fixed in daily built images.
	</dd>

	<dt>kFreeBSD images not available</dt>
	<dd>
	The support for kFreeBSD is still being integrated into the installer
	and is not available in this release. Work is being done to fix it
	in the upcoming releases.
	</dd>
