<h1><a name="rc2">Errata for release candidate 2</a></h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the rc2 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Red screen at boot.</b>
	Sometimes the installer may come up with a red screen at boot when
	using the 2.6 kernel. The install and works fine, there is no error,
	but the screen background is just the wrong color, red, instead of
	blue. This is bug #<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/273192">273192</a>.
	</li>
	<li><b>Sparc 32 fails to install from CD.</b>
	Sparc32 systems will fail to install from CD due to a missing isofs
	kernel module.
	</li>
	<li><b>Ia64 2.6 USB keyboard problem.</b>
	The ia64 installer has a bug that prevents USB keyboards and other
	USB devices from working during the installation process, when the
	2.6 kernel is used. Use the 2.4 kernel as a workaround, or install
	from a daily build, or use a serial console or non-USB keyboard for
	the install.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="pre-rc2">Old errata for pre-rc2</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>CDROM mount points vanish at each boot</b>
	If your /media/cdrom mount point is removed each time you boot, you
	are experiencing <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/255103">a bug in
	discover1</a>. Run <tt>dpkg-reconfigure discover1</tt> and tell
	it not to manage your CDROM mount points. This is fixed in unstable
	and will soon be fixed in testing.
	</li>
	<li><b>Country selection fails for languages with only one
	country</b>
	Languages such as Japanese or Finnish that have only one country
	they're likely to be spoken in tickle a bug in the installer, which
	crashes after the language is selected. This is fixed in the daily
	builds.
	</li>
	<li><b>Leaves <tt>/.aptitude</tt> directory</b>
	The install accidentally leaves a <tt>/.aptitude</tt> in the root
	directory, rather than in root's home directory. This is fixed in
	newer versions of the installer, and the directory can be removed
	with no ill effects.
	</li>
</ul>

<h1><a name="rc1">Old errata for release candidate 1</a></h1>

<ul>
	<li><b>Partitioner may confuse identical sized partitions.</b>
	In some circumstances, the partitioner may confuse partitions on
	different disks that have the same size. Take care when working
	with such partitions that the partitioner is acting on the
	partition you told it to. (This is fixed in the daily builds.)</li>

	<li><b>At least 64 mb needed for s390 install.</b>
	On s390, your virtual machine must have 64M to install.
	(This is dealt with in the daily builds.)
	</li>
	
	<li><b>Hotplug bugs lead to reboot loops, no display.</b>
	The version of hotplug installed by rc1 may try to load hardware
	watchdog modules that cause the system to reboot about 1 minute
	after they're loaded. Or it might load a frame buffer driver that
	makes the console unusable. To work around these problems, boot
	into emergency mode, and either add the unsafe modules (such as
	"i810-tco") to /etc/hotplug/blacklist, or disable/remove hotplug
	(warning: disabling hotplug may make USB keyboards unusable).
	These bugs are fixed in newer versions of hotplug.
	</li>

	<li><b>Broken sparc CD images.</b>
	The sparc netinst and full CD images are broken due to a problem
	with mkisofs. The businesscard CD is ok. We're working to produce
	fixed images. If "file" reports a large negative number of blocks
	on your ISO image, it's one of the bad ones and will not boot.
	</li>
</ul>
