<h1>Errata for <humanversion /></h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the <humanversion /> release of the Debian
Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here, please send us an
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/amd64/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">installation
report</a> describing the problem.

<dl class="gloss">
     <dt>GNOME may fail to start with some virtual machine setups</dt>
     <dd>It was noticed during Stretch Alpha 4 image testing that
     GNOME might fail to start depending on the setup used for virtual
     machines. It seems using cirrus as an emulated video chip is fine.
     <br />
     <b>Status:</b> Being investigated.</dd>

     <dt>Booting with grub from an XFS /boot partition fails</dt>
     <dd>Grub might have trouble to boot from an XFS partition due to
     a feature it doesn't support yet
     (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/802138">#802138</a>). At this
     point, it is recommended to use a separate /boot
     partition with a different filesystem, which the installer will
     likely suggest in a later version. The need for this separate
     partition should disappear once proper support is implemented
     in grub.
     <br />
     <b>Status:</b> Detection and workaround suggestion are planned
     for a later release.</dd>

     <dt>Desktop installations may not work using CD#1 alone</dt>

     <dd>Due to space constraints on the first CD, not all of the
     expected GNOME desktop packages fit on CD#1. For a successful
     installation, use extra package sources (e.g. a second CD or a
     network mirror) or use a DVD instead. <br /> <b>Status:</b> It is
     unlikely more efforts can be made to fit more packages on
     CD#1. </dd>

     <dt>Theme used in the installer</dt>

     <dd>There's no Stretch artwork yet, and the installer is still
       using the Jessie theme, which might be confusing (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/793125">#793125</a>).
       <br />
       <b>Status:</b> Worked around in Stretch Alpha 3.</dd>

     <dt>Boot menus in multi-arch image</dt>

     <dd>The boot menus of the multi-arch image suffer from some
       regression: <q>Rescue</q> menus are missing for the 32-bit
       flavours (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/793118">#793118</a>).
       <br />
       <b>Status:</b> Fixed in Stretch Alpha 2.</dd>

     <dt>Encrypted installation failures</dt>

     <dd>A regression in partman-crypto makes it impossible to perform
       encryption installations where settings are not set through
       preseeding (<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/793643">#793643</a>).
       <br />
       <b>Status:</b> Fixed in Stretch Alpha 3.</dd>

<!-- things should be better starting with Jessie Beta 2...
	<dt>GNU/kFreeBSD support</dt>

	<dd>GNU/kFreeBSD installation images suffer from various
	important bugs
	(<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/757985"><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/757985">#757985</a></a>,

	into shape!</dd>

<!-- kind of obsoleted by the first "important change" mentioned in the 20140813 announce...
	<dt>Accessibility of the installed system</dt>
	<dd>Even if accessibility technologies are used during the
	installation process, they might not be automatically enabled
	within the installed system.
	</dd>

<!-- leaving this in for possible future use...
	<dt>Desktop installations on i386 do not work using CD#1 alone</dt>
	<dd>Due to space constraints on the first CD, not all of the expected GNOME desktop
	packages fit on CD#1. For a successful installation, use extra package sources (e.g.
	a second CD or a network mirror) or use a DVD instead.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> It is unlikely more efforts can be made to fit more packages on CD#1.

<!-- ditto...
	<dt>Potential issues with UEFI booting on amd64</dt>
	<dd>There have been some reports of issues booting the Debian Installer in UEFI mode
	on amd64 systems. Some systems apparently do not boot reliably using <code>grub-efi</code>, and some
	others show graphics corruption problems when displaying the initial installation splash
	screen.
	<br />
	If you encounter either of these issues, please file a bug report and give as much detail
	as possible, both about the symptoms and your hardware - this should assist the team to fix
	these bugs. As a workaround for now, try switching off UEFI and installing using <q>Legacy
	BIOS</q> or <q>Fallback mode</q> instead.
	<br />
	<b>Status:</b> More bug fixes might appear in the various Wheezy point releases.

<!-- ditto...
	<dt>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</dt>
	<dd>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
