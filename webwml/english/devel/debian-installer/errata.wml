<h1><a name="etch-beta1">Errata for etch beta 1</a></h1>

<p>
This is a list of known problems in the etch beta 1 release of the
Debian-Installer. If you do not see your problem listed here,
please send us an <a href="report-template">installation report</a>
describing the problem.
</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<b>netinst iso too large</b><br>
	The netinst iso is too large to fit on a 128 mb USB stick. It will
	work as a regular CD image or on larger USB sticks for a USB
	install.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>graphical installer is alpha quality</b><br>
	The grphical installer included in this release is alpha quality,
	with known bugs and limitations. Use at your own risk.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>i386: more than 32 mb of memory is needed to install</b><br>
	The minimum amount of memory needed to successfully install on i386
	is 48 mb, instead of the previous 32 mb. We hope to reduce the
	requirements back to 32 mb later. Memory requirements may have
	also changed for other architectures.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>sparc: 2.4 incorrectly enters lowmem mode</b><br>
	Due to a bug in the installer when running with the sparc 2.4
	kernel, it will enter low memory mode on all systems, no matter the
	amount of free memory. We recommend using the 2.6 kernel instead if
	possible.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>sparc: 2.4 netboot images need special parameter to boot</b><br>
	netboot image needs to be passed ramdisk_size=16000 to boot the 2.4
	kernel properly
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>oldworld powerpc: floppies not bootable</b><br>
	The oldworld powerpc boot floppies will not work as miboot is not
	included.
	</li>
	
	<li>
	<b>s390: Not supported.</b><br>
	The s390 architecture is not included in this release due to lack
	of support in parted.
	</li>

	<li>
	<b>sparc32: 2.6 kernel not supported</b><br>
	Only the 2.4 kernel works with the sparc32 subarchitecture.
	</li>
</ul>
