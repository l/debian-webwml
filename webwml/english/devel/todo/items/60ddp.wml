A lot of the <a href="../../doc/ddp">Debian Documentation Project</a>
manuals seems to be dead. Some of them are not maintained anymore, never
finished, never started etc. When not dropping the whole thing it would
be a good idea to work on these manuals since they have the power to
help people working with our wonderful software distribution.
