<a href="mailto:dirson@debian.org">Yann Dirson</a> has started to work on
some scripts designed to track build informations on all packages, in
order to know automatically when a package needs to be rebuilt.<br>
Unfortunately, he doesn't have enough time to work on it anymore, and he
is looking for someone to carry on his work.
