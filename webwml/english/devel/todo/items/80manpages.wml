There are still a lot of programs in Debian that don't have a manpage.
Every program in /bin, /usr/bin, /sbin, /usr/sbin, /usr/games and /usr/X11R6/bin
should have one. Those programs manpages are generally symlinked to
undocumented(7) but that doesn't mean they don't deserve one, even if it
is sparse. Help in writing them is always appreciated by package maintainers.<br>

Also, there are numerous bugs in the
<tt><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/manpages">manpages</a></tt> and
<tt><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/manpages-dev">manpages-dev</a></tt>
packages, which require skilled people knowing the involved standards to
deal with.
