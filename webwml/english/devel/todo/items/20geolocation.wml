The Debian developers can enter geographic coordinates on the
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">developers' database</a>,
but right now they are not used for much, and this should change. They
should be able to get a
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~edward/globe/test.php">list of
distances to other developers</a>, but more accurate and with
names and details.<br>
The goal is to obtain a tool to easily exchange GPG keys between
developers when going on vacation, or to sign new developers' keys.
Coupling the tool with the <a href="http://nm.debian.org/">new
maintainers database</a>, with a map generation tool, or
(non-exclusive or) with time-domain location (to put in contact
journeying developers) would be interesting improvements.
