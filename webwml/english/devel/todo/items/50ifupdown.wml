In Debian systems, the ifup and ifdown commands are responsible for setting
up the network. Currently, they write some information at bootup in
the /etc/network/ifstate file, as /var is not yet mounted at that time.
Storing them in memory (there are many ways to achieve that) would lead to
better FHS compliance and improved diskless support.
