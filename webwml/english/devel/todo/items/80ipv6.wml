The sarge distribution should support the <a href="http://www.ipv6.org/">IPv6</a>
protocol as widely as possible. Still, the
<a href="http://debian.seabone.net/">experimental IPv6 archive</a>
needs help for building woody/sarge/sid packages on ARM, ia64, m68k,
mipsel and s390 arches.<br>
Moreover, many packages still need
<a href="http://debian.seabone.net/devel.html">IPv6 patches</a>, and the
existing patches need to be tested and integrated into the main archive.
