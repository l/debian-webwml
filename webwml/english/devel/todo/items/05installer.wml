Before sarge can be released, we need a completely new and working
<a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.
Unfortunately only very few people are working on it, so work is done
very slow. The debian-installer doesn't remotely work on anything but
i386. Hence, we need skilled non-i386 people for porting especially.
<p>
It is also necessary for the <a href="../debian-desktop/">Debian-Desktop</a>
project to ensure that debian-installer will be accessible
to people with little computer knowledge.
