Since the release of Sarge, Debian installations can be made with the
new <a href="../debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> (or d-i for
short). We constantly need help, particularly for architectures other
than i386, with further development, with completing translations to
other languages, and with documentation.  Much work remains to be done
polishing and streamlining the installer as well as adding new
features. And even just testing it on varied hardware and sending in
installation reports can be a great help to the project.
