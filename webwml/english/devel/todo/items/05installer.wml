Before sarge can be released, we need a completely new and working
<a href="../debian-installer">debian-installer</a>.
We particularly need help with architectures aside from i386, and on
completing translations to other languages, and documentation. Much work
remains to be done in polishing and streamlining the installer. And even
testing it on varied hardware and sending in install reports can be a great
help to the project.
<p>
It is also necessary for the <a href="../debian-desktop/">Debian-Desktop</a>
project to ensure that debian-installer will be accessible
to people with little computer knowledge.
