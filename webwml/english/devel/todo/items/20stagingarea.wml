During the Perl 5.6 -&gt; Perl 5.8 transition, a staging area was set up to
smooth the transition in unstable. As this idea gave quite successful
results, it would be valuable to be able to use it for other important
transitions. That's why it is proposed to make a package and/or a set of
scripts available on a Debian project machine to setup and handle such a
staging area easily.<br>
The scripts used by bod are still available on auric.
