The Debian website is maintained by a few people basically. For such a large
project (entire source: 64MB, plus documentation) this is not enough
normally. The website could be improved in several ways, some of them
are written down in our todo list, some are not.<br>
<br>
It would be a good idea if somebody would see how the entire website
could be turned into a single layout instead of three or more different
layouts. Reviewing, updating and creating of new documentation would
also be helpful.
