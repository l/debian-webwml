<P>GPG/PGP keys of package maintainers can be downloaded from
<A HREF="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/d/debian-keyring/">here</A>.

<p>If you would like to see a map of the world showing the location of many
maintainers, take a look at the <a href="developers.loc">World Map of Debian
Developers</a>.

<p>There are a number of groups that maintain particularly important
or difficult packages. Of special note is Debian Quality Assurance
(QA) group, which maintains orphaned packages.

<p>If a person is a co-maintainer (or uploader) for the package and not its
primary maintainer, this will be indicated by an asterisk (*) behind the
package name. This is often the case for group-maintained packages.

# people.names is not in CVS because it is generated dynamically.
