#use wml::debian::template title="Useful Translation Suggestions"

<p>Please see the pages about <a href="working">working on the web pages</a>
which describe some general things to observe, not strictly limited to
translations.

<h3>What to translate?</h3>

<p>New translations should always start by adding translated slices to
the .wml files in english/templates/debian/. Be careful when adding
your translation as you can easily break all the web pages if a
mistake is made.

<p>Once you start translating pages, we recommend you start with pages
that users are most likely to visit (in rough order of importance):
<ul>
<li><strong>Most important:</strong> main page, .wml files in the main
directory. Files in the following directories: intro, misc, releases,
distrib, doc, events, searchtmpl and security(*).
Also create the translated <a href="navbar_images">images for the navigation bar</a>.
<li><strong>Standard:</strong> Files in the following directories:
Bugs, banners, logos, MailingLists(*), consultants, ports, partners and
News(*).
<li><strong>Least Important:</strong> Files in the devel(*), vote and
mirror directories. Since they are mostly for developers, and the primary
language of developers is English, it is only when you have a strong
translation team should you attempt to tackle these. Files or
directories marked by an asterisk, '*', above are modified frequently,
so are harder to keep up to date.
</ul>
<strong>It is important that you only translate files that you have
the time to maintain. A few well maintained pages is much more useful
than a lot of out of date ones.</strong>

<h3>How closely should translations follow the original?</h3>

<p>There are times when you may want to make a change to the content when
you are translating. One example is on the support page; you will probably
want to include an example on subscribing to the language specific mailing
list, e.g. debian-french on the French version of the pages.

<p>If you make more significant changes, please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www list</a>
as it is desired to keep the content as similar as possible
between the different versions.

<p>The pages are meant to be useful. If you have information that
will help the users of your language, feel free to add it. You can use
international/&lt;Language&gt;.wml for all the stuff interesting to
Language-speaking visitors.

<p>If you know of information that would be useful to all users,
bring it up on debian-www.

<h3>How do translators know when files need to be updated?</h3>

<P>There is a mechanism that translators can use to <a href="uptodate">
keeping web site translations up-to-date</a>.

<h3>How do users know if a translated page is out of date?</h3>

<P>The <code>translation-check</code> template which is used to
<a href="uptodate">keep translations up-to-date</a> will make a note in
translations which are outdated.

<h3>Things to observe when translating</h3>

<p>The following is a list of pages and directories that may require special
attention when translating:

<dl>
<dt><tt>News/</tt>
   <dd>You can translate as many or as few pieces of news as you wish. The
   indices are created automatically from the titles of the items. If an
   item has been translated, then the translated title will be used in the
   index.</dd>

<dt><tt>security/</tt>
   <dd>This is set up similar to the News/ directory. There's one
   difference, there are .data files that you should <em>not</em> translate.</dd>

<dt><tt>distrib/vendors.wml</tt> includes <tt>vendors.CD</tt> which includes <tt>vendors.CD.def</tt>
   <dd>distrib/vendors.wml should be translated.<br>
   distrib/vendors.CD.def should have translations added to it. In other
   words, there is only one copy of this file. The format should be apparent
   from the file.<br>
   distrib/vendors.CD contains the actual list of vendors. Translators
   should have no reason to touch this file.</dd>

<dt><tt>intro/organization.wml</tt>

   <dd>Includes <tt>organization.tags</tt> which contains the translatable
   stuff, and <tt>organization.data</tt> which contains the things that
   shouldn't be translated.</dd>

<dt><tt>MailingLists/{un,}subscribe.wml</tt>

   <dd>These two files are generated by the <tt>mklist</tt> script, so you
   shouldn't edit them directly. You can translate the files in the desc/
   subdirectory, they contain the descriptions of mailing lists.</dd>

<dt><tt>devel/people.wml</tt>
   <dd>Includes <tt>../../english/devel/people.names</tt> which is generated
   daily by a script parsing Packages files and the developers'
   database. Simply touch the people.names file if you want to build
   people.xy.html.</dd>

<dt><tt>consultants/index.wml</tt>
   <dd>Includes <tt>../../english/consultants/consultants.data</tt> which needs to
   have the translations for the phrases added to the top part.</dd>

<dt><tt>releases/potato/index.wml</tt>
   <dd>Translate everything but the Perl code (stuff enclosed in &lt;: :&gt;),
   except for the _second_ argument of permute_as_list.</dd>

<dt><tt>ports/</tt>
   <dd>These are still under development. You should only translate these if
   you are willing to spend the time keeping them up to date.</dd>

<dt><tt>mirror/</tt>
   <dd>This is for people setting up mirrors, so it is quite low priority.</dd>

<dt><tt>devel/website</tt>
   <dd>This is for people editing or translating web pages, so it is
   probably very low priority.</dd>
</dl>
