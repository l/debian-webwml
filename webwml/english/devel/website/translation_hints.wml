<p>Please see the pages about <a href="working">working on the web pages</a>
which describe some general things to observe, not strictly limited to
translations.

<h2>What to translate?</h2>

<p>See the <a href="translating#completenew">instructions for starting a new
translation</a> for an introduction.</p>

<p>Once you start translating pages, we recommend you start with pages
that users are most likely to visit (in rough order of importance):
</p>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Most important:</strong></dt>
  <dd>
  <ul>
    <li>the main directory: index.wml, contact.wml, donations.wml,
        social_contract.wml, support.wml</li>
    <li>the intro/ directory: about.wml, cn.wml, free.wml, why_debian.wml</li>
    <li>the releases/ directory: index.wml</li>
    <li>the releases/<current_release_name>/ directory: index.wml,
        installmanual.wml, releasenotes.wml</li>
    <li>the distrib/ directory: index.wml, packages.wml, netinst.wml, ftplist.wml</li>
    <li>the mirror/ directory: list.wml</li>
    <li>the CD/ directory: index.wml</li>
    <li>the doc/ directory: index.wml</li>
    <li>the MailingLists/ directory: index.wml</li>
    <li>the searchtmpl/ directory: search.wml</li>
    <li>the security/ directory: index.wml</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Standard:</strong></dt>
  <dd>The remaining files in the aforementioned directories, and these:
  <ul>
    <li>Bugs/index.wml, Bugs/Reporting.wml</li>
    <li>banners/index.wml</li>
    <li>consultants/index.wml</li>
    <li>doc/ddp.wml</li>
    <li>events/index.wml</li>
    <li>international/index.wml, and create a page (or directory) for your
        language</li>
    <li>logos/index.wml</li>
    <li>mirror/index.wml</li>
    <li>misc/index.wml, misc/related_links.wml</li>
    <li>News/index.wml</li>
    <li>News/weekly/index.wml</li>
    <li>ports/index.wml</li>
    <li>partners/index.wml</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Optional:</strong></dt>
  <dd>All the other files in the previously mentioned directories.
  This includes the following directories which include subdirectories that
  are modified frequently, so are harder to keep up to date:
  <ul>
    <li>MailingLists/desc/</li>
    <li>News/</li>
    <li>doc/books.wml</li>
    <li>events/</li>
    <li>security/</li>
  </ul>
  </dd>
<dt><strong>Least Important:</strong></dt>
  <dd>Files in the devel/ and vote/ directories. Since they are mostly
  for developers, and the primary language of developers is English, it
  is only when you have a strong translation team should you attempt to
  tackle these.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<strong>It is important that you only translate files that you have
the time to maintain. A few well maintained pages is much more useful
than a lot of out of date ones.</strong>

<h2>How closely should translations follow the original?</h2>

<p>There are times when you may want to make a change to the content when
you are translating. One example is on the support page; you will probably
want to include an example on subscribing to the language specific mailing
list, e.g. debian-user-french on the French version of the pages.

<p>If you make more significant changes, please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www list</a>
as it is desired to keep the content as similar as possible
between the different versions.

<p>The pages are meant to be useful. If you have information that
will help the users of your language, feel free to add it. You can use
international/&lt;Language&gt;.wml for all the stuff interesting to
Language-speaking visitors.

<p>If you know of information that would be useful to all users,
bring it up on debian-www.

<h2>How do translators know when files need to be updated?</h2>

<P>There is a mechanism that translators can use to <a href="uptodate">
keeping web site translations up-to-date</a>.

<h2>How do we keep the gettext template translations up to date?</h2>

<p>After the English files have been updated, run <kbd>make update-po</kbd>
in the <code>po/</code> subdirectory of your translation to update your .po
files with the originals. Watching the log messages on the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-cvs/">debian-www-cvs mailing
list</a> can be helpful to find out when this should be done; or you can
simply run it at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Use the <kbd>make stats</kbd> command to see an overview of the changes.
Gettext will mark the tags whose value it had to guess with
"<code>#, fuzzy</code>", and newly introduced tags will simply have an empty
string after <code>msgstr</code>.</p>

<h2>How do users know if a translated page is out of date?</h2>

<P>The <code>translation-check</code> template which is used to
<a href="uptodate">keep translations up-to-date</a> will make a note in
translations which are outdated.

<h2>Things to observe when translating</h2>

<p>The following is a list of pages and directories that may require special
attention when translating:

<dl>
<dt><tt>News/</tt>
   <dd>You can translate as many or as few pieces of news as you wish. The
   indices are created automatically from the titles of the items. If an
   item has been translated, then the translated title will be used in the
   index.</dd>

<dt><tt>security/</tt>
   <dd>This is set up similar to the News/ directory. There's one
   difference, there are .data files that you should <em>not</em> translate.</dd>

<dt><tt>CD/vendors/</tt>
   <dd>Only the *.wml files in CD/vendors/ should be translated.
   Translations for tags are added via gettext in the
   po/vendors.<var>xy</var>.po file.</dd>

<dt><tt>intro/organization.wml</tt>
   <dd>Tags are translated via gettext in the
   po/organization.<var>xy</var>.po file.</dd>

<dt><tt>MailingLists/{un,}subscribe.wml</tt>
   <dd>These two files are generated by the <tt>mklist</tt> script, so you
   can't edit them directly. You can translate the files in the desc/
   subdirectory, they contain the descriptions of mailing lists.
   Tags are translated via gettext in the po/mailinglists.<var>xy</var>.po
   file.
   </dd>

<dt><tt>devel/people.wml</tt>
   <dd>Includes <tt>../../english/devel/people.names</tt> which is generated
   daily by
   <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/cron/people_scripts/?cvsroot=webwml">a
   script parsing Packages files and the developers' database</a>.
   Simply touch the people.names file if you want to build
   people.xy.html.</dd>

<dt><tt>consultants/index.wml</tt>
   <dd>Tags are translated via gettext in the po/consultants.<var>xy</var>.po
   file.</dd>

<dt><tt>releases/*/{installmanual,releasenotes}.wml</tt>
   <dd>Translate everything but the Perl code (stuff enclosed in &lt;: :&gt;),
   except for the <strong>second</strong> argument of permute_as_list.</dd>

<dt><tt>ports/</tt>
   <dd>Port pages may be volatile. You should only translate these if
   you are willing to spend the time keeping them up to date.</dd>

<dt><tt>devel/website/</tt>
   <dd>This is for people editing or translating web pages, so it is
   probably very low priority.</dd>
</dl>
