#use wml::debian::template title="Translation Suggestions"

The information on this page is somewhat random items
that didn't fit elsewhere, but translators will find
useful.

<h3>What to translate?</h3>
Our suggestion is to start with the pages that users
would be most likely to visit:
main page, package page, vendor list, files in the intro
directory, security, etc.
Creating the <a href="navbar_images">images for the navigation bar</a>
should also be a high priority.
Pages that would not interest many users should be low
priority. For example, the developer pages.

<h3>How accurate should translations be?</h3>
<p>There are times when
you may want to make a change to the content when you are
translating. One example is on the support page; you will
probably want to include an example on subscribing to the
language specific mailing list, e.g. debian-french on the
French version of the pages. If you make more significant changes,
please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
as it is desired to keep the content as similar as possible
between the different versions.

<p>The pages are meant to be useful. If you have information that
will help the users of your language, feel free to add it.
If you know of information that would be useful to all users,
bring it up on debian-www.

<h3>Can I modify the English version?</h3>
That depends. If you see a small mistake, like a typo, just fix it.
If you feel that something is awful and needs to be rewritten, bring
it up on debian-www so it can be discussed. We'll probably agree
with you.

<H3>Adding New Directories</H3>
<P>Some care should be taken when adding a new directory to CVS.
If the current directory is listed in ../Makefile then the current directory should
contain a Makefile - otherwise 'make' will give an error message.
You do not need to worry about non-existant directories being listed in a SUBS variable
since make is intelligent enough to skip them.

<h3>This link doesn't look right. Should I change it?</h3>
Because of the way the web servers are set up (using
<a href="content_negotiation">content negotiation</a>),
you should not have to change any of the internal links.
In fact we suggest you don't. Write to debian-www
if you feel a link is incorrect before changing it.

<h3>Look for READMEs in the English directories</h3>
<p>Some of the directories contain a README to help you understand
how that directory is organized. These should provide any special
information needed when working in that area.

<h3>What are these lines beginning with '#'?</h3>
In wml, a line beginning with a '#' is a comment. These are
preferred to normal html comments as they don't show up on the
final page.

<h3>What are these foo.def and foo.data files?</h3>
Some pages contain multiple pieces of information that are in roughly
the same format. A good example is the vendors page, where each
vendors listing contains the same fields.

<p>To make it easier to keep the translations up to date, we have
separated out the generic parts (data) from the textual parts
(text) of the page. You only need to copy and translate the
.wml version of the file. You then need to add the translated
slices in the data file (usually called foo.data or foo.def).

<p>An example should make this clear. Using the vendors page
again:
<dl>
<dt>vendors.wml
<dd>should be translated as usual, with a copy in <lang>/distrib.
vendors.wml #includes ../../english/devel/vendors.CD
<dt>vendors.CD
<dd>contains the actual list of vendors. This file does not
contain any language specific information - only information about
the actual vendors. It #includes vendors.CD.def
<dt>vendors.CD.def
<dd>contains the translation of all phrases needed in
vendors.CD. You should add translations for all the slices.
