#use wml::debian::template title="Translating Debian web pages" BARETITLE=true

<P>To make the job of the translators as easy as possible the pages are
generated a bit differently than many of you will be used to. The web pages
are actually generated using source that is marked up with
<a href="http://www.engelschall.com/sw/wml/"><tt>wml</tt></a>.
There are separate directories for each language.

<p>If you plan to start an entirely new translation of the Debian web site,
please see the <a href="#completenew">section on starting a new
translation</a>.

<h2><a name="singlepages">Translating individual pages</a></h2>

<p>We use WML to separate the specific content of a page from the elements
common to multiple pages. This means that one needs to edit certain WML
source files instead of HTML files. Please <a href="using_cvs">use CVS</a>
to acquire the current sources.  You'll need to check out at least two
directories: <tt>webwml/english/</tt> and <tt>webwml/<var>&lt;language&gt;</var>/</tt>.</p> 

<p>To translate a single page from English into your language, the original
.wml file needs to be translated and placed within the other language's
directory. The relative path and name need to be the same as in the English
directory in order for the links to continue to work.</p>

<h3>Translation headers</h3>
<p>It is strongly
recommended that the translator adds an additional line to the headers
after the last <code>#use</code> statement to record the exact revision of 
the original file that was translated, so that <a href="uptodate">updating is 
easier</a>. The line looks like this:
<kbd>#use wml::debian::translation-check translation="<var>x.y</var>"</kbd>

<p>Some translation teams also use this line to mark the official
translator of each web page. Doing so, you will get automatic mails
when the pages you maintain are updated in English, and need your
attention to update the translation. For that, simply add your name as
maintainer at the end of the <code>#use</code> line to make it look
like this:
<kbd>#use wml::debian::translation-check translation="<var>x.y</var>" maintainer="<var>your name</var>"</kbd>

<p>You also need to explain to the robot who you are, how often you
want to get automatic mails and their content. For that, edit (or let
your coordinator edit) the file
webwml/<var>language</var>/international/<var>language</var>/translator.db.pl
in the CVS.  The syntax should be quite understandable, and you can
use the file of the French team as template if it does not exist for
your language yet. The robot can send several kinds of information, and
for each of them, you can choose the frequency at which it will be
sent to you. The different kinds of information are:
<ul>
 <li><b>summary</b>:  a summary of which documents are outdated</li>
 <li><b>logs</b>: the "cvs log" between the translated and current versions</li>
 <li><b>diff</b>: "cvs diff"</li>
 <li><b>tdiff</b>: the script will try to find the part of the translated text modified by the English patch</li>
 <li><b>file</b>: add the current version of the file to translate</li>
</ul>

<p>Then, for each of them, the value should be one of: 0 (never), 1 (monthly), 2 (weekly) or 3 (daily).</p>

<p>An example could be:
<pre>
                'Martin Quinson' => {
                        email       => 'martin.quinson@tuxfamily.org',
                        summary     => 3,
                        logs        => 3,
                        diff        => 3,
                        tdiff       => 0,
                        file        => 0
                },
</pre></p>

<p>The header of the web page can be easily produced by using the
<tt>copypage.pl</tt> script in the webwml root directory. The script
will copy the page to the right place, create directories and
makefiles if necessary, and add the required header automatically.</p>

<p>After you have run e.g. <kbd>./copypage.pl <var>file</var>.wml</kbd>,
translate the original text within the file. Comments in files will indicate
if there are items that should not be translated; respect them. Don't do any
unnecessary changes to the formatting; if something needs to be fixed, it
should likely be done in the original file.</p>

<h3>Page building and publishing</h3>

<p>Since we use <a href="content_negotiation">content negotiation</a>,
HTML files are not named <tt><var>file</var>.html</tt> but
<tt><var>file</var>.<var>&lt;lang&gt;</var>.html</tt>, where <var>&lt;lang&gt;</var>
is the two letter code of the language, according to
<a href="http://ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/http/related/iso639.txt">ISO 639</a>
(e.g. <tt>fr</tt> for French).</p>

<p>You can build HTML from WML by running
<kbd>make <var>file</var>.<var>&lt;lang&gt;</var>.html</kbd>.
If that works, check if the syntax is fully valid with
<kbd>weblint <var>file</var>.<var>&lt;lang&gt;</var>.html</kbd>.</p>

<p>The web pages will get rebuilt from CVS on the www-master server, and
this process is for the most part impervious to errors. However, if you
commit a broken file in the top level of your translation (e.g. the
top-level index.wml file), it will break the build process and stall all
the other updates to the web site. Please pay special attention to these
files.</p>

<p>Once the page is good to go, you can commit it into CVS. If you have
the permissions to do this yourself, run <kbd>cvs commit</kbd>; if not,
send it to <a href="translation_coordinators">somebody with write
access to the repository</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="completenew">Starting a new translation</a></h2>

<p>If you would like to start translation of the Debian web pages into
a new language, send us e-mail (in English) at
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.

<p>First of all, make sure you have made a proper checkout of our source
tree, as described <a href="using_cvs">on our CVS introduction page</a>.</p>

<p>After you have checked out the webwml/ directory and (at least)
webwml/english/, start by creating a new directory for your translation,
next to english/ and others. The name of the translation directory must
be in English and entirely lowercase (e.g. "german", not "Deutsch").</p>

<p>Copy the <tt>Make.lang</tt> and <tt>.wmlrc</tt> files from the english/
directory to the new translation directory. These files are essential for
building your translation from WML files. They have been designed so that
after you copy them to the new language directory, you only have to change
these things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The variable LANGUAGE must be changed in the file <tt>Make.lang</tt>.

  <li>The variables CUR_LANG, CUR_ISO_LANG and CHARSET must be changed in
      the <tt>.wmlrc</tt> file. Add CUR_LOCALE to that, if you need it for
      sorting.

  <li>Some languages may need extra processing to handle the charset. This
      can be done using the --prolog and --epilog options to wml. Use the
      WMLPROLOG and WMLEPILOG variables in <tt>Make.lang</tt> to do this.

  <li>The variable LANGUAGES must be changed in top-level
      <tt>webwml/Makefile</tt> file so that your language will get built
      along with the other ones, on www.debian.org. We would prefer if you
      left this particular change up to the webmasters, because you may not
      be aware that your translation is broken when checked out of CVS
      afresh, which could break the building process of the rest of our web
      site.
</ol>

<p>After that is done, put the following line in a new file called
"Makefile" in that directory:

<pre>
<protect>include $(subst webwml/<var>yourlanguagedir</var>,webwml/english,$(CURDIR))/Makefile</protect>
</pre>

<p>(Replace <var>yourlanguagedir</var> with the name of your language's
directory, of course.)</p>

<p>Now create a subdirectory inside your language's directory called "po",
and copy the same Makefile to that subdirectory (<kbd>cp ../Makefile .</kbd>).
</p>

<p>In the po/ directory, run <kbd>make init-po</kbd> to generate the initial
set of *.po files.</p>

<p>Now that you have the skeleton set up, you can start
adding your translations in our shared WML tags used in templates.
The first templates that you should translate are those that appear
on all of the web pages, like the header keywords, the ALT tags for
the images, and the footer.</p>

# The page on <a href="using_wml">using WML</a> has more information on this.

<p>Start translating in the <code>po/templates.<var>xy</var>.po</code> file
(where <var>xy</var> is your language's two-letter code). For every
<code>msgid "<var>something</var>"</code> there is initially a
<code>msgstr ""</code> where you should fill in the translation of
<var>something</var> in the double quotes after <code>msgstr</code>.</p>

<p>You don't have to translate all of the strings in all of the .po files,
just those that your currently translated pages actually need. To see if you
need to translate a string, see the comments in the .po file just above each
<code>msgid</code> statement. If the referenced file is in
<tt>english/template/debian</tt>, then you should most likely translate it.
If not, you can postpone it for later, when you actually translate the
relevant section of the web pages that require it.</p>

<p>If you aren't sure if you did something properly, ask on the debian-www
mailing list before committing.</p>

<p>You should <a href="navbar_images">translate the text on the images</a>
in the red navigation bar, too.

<p>Note: if you find you need to make any other changes, send mail to
debian-www saying what you changed and why, so the problem can be corrected.

<p>After the template skeleton is done, you can start with translating the
front page and the other *.wml files. For a list of files that
should be translated first, check <a href="translation_hints">the hints
page</a>. Translate *.wml pages as described <a href="#singlepages">at
the top of this page</a>.</p>

<h3>The rest of the story</h3>

<p>The description above will probably be enough to get you started.
Afterwards, you will want to refer to the following documents which provide
more detailed explanations and additional useful information.</p>

<ul>
<li>A number of <a href="examples">examples</a> are provided to give you
    a clearer idea of how to get started.
<li>A number of common questions are answered and helpful hints provided in
    the <a href="translation_hints">translation hints</a> page.
<li>We have mechanisms in place to aid in <a href="uptodate">keeping the
    translations up to date</a>.
<li>To see how your translation compares to others in the amount of files
    translated, check the <a href="stats/">statistics</a>.
</ul>

<P>We hope you find the work we've done will make translating
the pages as easy as possible. As has already been mentioned, if
you have any questions, you can ask them on the <a
href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www</a> mailing
list.
