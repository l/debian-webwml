#use wml::debian::template title="Translating Pages"

<P>To make the job of the translators as easy as possible the pages are generated
a bit differently than many of you will be used to. The web pages are actually generated
using source that is marked up with wml. There are separate directories for each
language.

<h3>Overview</h3>
To start a new translation, someone must first add translations to the wml template
files in english/template/debian/*.wml
Please follow the comments as there are items that should not be translated.

<p>The page on <a href="using_wml">using wml</a> has information on slices
that you will find helpful when translating the template files.

<p>The next thing to do is to create a new directory for the translation,
copy
<pre>
   Make*
   .wmlrc
</pre>
from the english directory to the new translation direcotry. Modify
them appropriately and commit them. You can then start translating files.

<h3>The rest of the story</h3>
Clearly the description above is not enough to get you started.
Below, are a number of links that will explain the above steps in more
detail and provide additional useful information.

<ul>
<li>A number of <a href="examples">examples</a> are provided to give you
    a clearer idea of how to get started.
<li>A number of common questions are answered and helpful hints provided in
    the <a href="translation_hints">translation hints</a> page.
<li>To give your pages a professional look, you will want to
    <a href="navbar_images">translate the navbar images</a>.
<li>Most of the translations use the program, <a href="uptodate">check_trans</a>
    to help them keep the translation up to date.
</ul>

<P>I hope you find the work we've done will make translating
the pages as easy as possible. As has already been mentioned, if
you have any questions, you can ask them on the debian-www mailing
list.

<p>Note: when a page is first translated, the other languages will not create
links to your page until they are regenerated.

<H3>Special files and directories</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>security/</b><br>
This directory contains the status of all Debian related security problems
that have been reported. Indices are created similarly to the News/ directory.
Translations are up to you.

<li><b>devel/people.wml</b><br>
This contains the list of package maintainers and what packages they maintain.
The list of names and packages is generated automatically and is kept in
webwml/english/devel/people.names. The only text in there that is english
specific is 'main', 'non-free', 'non-us', 'contrib' and 'homepage'.
If translators feel it is necessary, 'homepage' could be translated.
Send mail to debian-www if you would like this done.

<li><b>MailingLists/subscribe.wml and MailingLists/unsubscribe.wml</b><br>
These pages are generated automatically from scripts. Do not bother
translating these yet. A system for adding translations will be developed.

<li><b>distrib/vendors.wml</b><br>
vendors.wml should be translated. It includes <kbd>../../english/devel/vendors.CD</kbd>
which contains the actual list of vendors. This file does not contain any
language specific information, but includes <kbd>vendors.CD.def</kbd> which contains
the translation of all phrases needed in <kbd>vendors.CD</kbd>. You should add
translations for all entries of the form <kbd><protect>[EN:...:]</protect></kbd>.
For example,
<pre>
	<protect>[EN:Country:]\</protect>
	<protect>[ES:Pa-is:]\</protect>
	<protect>[DE:Land:]\</protect>
</pre>
Do not translate any other text on the page.

</ul>

<P>For the news items and security reports you might wish to only translate
the titles, to make it look good in the indices.
To do this, create a file with the same name as the original .wml file,
but with the extension <code>.title</code> instead.
Just include the define-tags that are used in the indices, i.e
<em>pagetitle</em> and <em>release_date</em> for the news items, and
<em>pagetitle</em>, <em>report_date</em> and <em>description</em> for
the security reports.

<P>There is no need to translate the dates in the headers of the news items
or security reports, they are automatically converted to the format
preferred by the language using the <code>ctime.wml</code> file in the
<code>english/template/debian</code> directory.
