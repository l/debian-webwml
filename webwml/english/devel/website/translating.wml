#use wml::debian::template title="Translating Pages"

<P>To make the job of the translators as easy as possible the pages are generated
a bit differently than many of you will be used to. The web pages are actually generated
using source that is marked up with wml. There are separate directories for each
language.

<h3>Overview</h3>
To start a new translation, someone must first add translations to the wml template
files in english/template/debian/*.wml
Please follow the comments as there are items that should not be translated.

<p>The page on <a href="using_wml">using wml</a> has information on slices
that you will find helpful when translating the template files.

<p>The next thing to do is to create a new directory for the translation,
copy
<pre>
   Make*
   .wmlrc
</pre>
from the english directory to the new translation direcotry. Modify
them appropriately and commit them. You can then start translating files.

<h3>The rest of the story</h3>
Clearly the description above is not enough to get you started.
Below, are a number of links that will explain the above steps in more
detail and provide additional useful information.

<ul>
<li>A number of <a href="examples">examples</a> are provided to give you
    a clearer idea of how to get started.
<li>A number of common questions are answered and helpful hints provided in
    the <a href="translation_hints">translation hints</a> page.
<li>To give your pages a professional look, you will want to
    <a href="navbar_images">translate the navbar images</a>.
<li>Most of the translations use the program, <a href="uptodate">check_trans</a>
    to help them keep the translation up to date.
</ul>

<P>I hope you find the work we've done will make translating
the pages as easy as possible. As has already been mentioned, if
you have any questions, you can ask them on the debian-www mailing
list.

<p>Note: when a page is first translated, the other languages will not create
links to your page until they are regenerated.
