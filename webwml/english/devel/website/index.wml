#use wml::debian::template title="Helping with the Debian Web Pages"

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Thank you for your interest in working on the Debian web
site. Due to the size of Debian and that the developers
are all volunteers, we have broken most tasks into more 
manageable pieces. Most work needed to help maintain the web
site does not involve programming so we can use the talents
of just about anyone.

<p>People helping with the web site in any capacity
should subscribe to the <code>debian-www</code> mailing list.
You can join the list easily from our convenient
<a href="../../MailingLists/subscribe">subscription page</a>.
All discussions involving the web site are held there.

<p>If you are looking for information on mirroring Debian,
you should go to the <a href="../../mirror/">mirror pages</a>.

<p>Because the web site is mirrored, the bulk of the pages
are static. We give the pages the same look and feel by having
wml do all the detail work of adding headers and footers to
pages. Although a wml page may look like html at first
glance, html is only one of the types of extra information
that can be added. After wml is finished running its various filters
over a file, the final product is true html. To give you an idea
of the power of wml, you can include perl into a page to allow
you to do, well, almost anything. Anyone who is working
on a lot of pages should install wml so they can test to
make sure the result is what they want. If you are running
Debian, you can easily install the wml package.

<p>The source for the web pages is stored under CVS.
If you are unfamiliar with this program, you will want to
read the pages on <a href="using_cvs">using cvs</a>.
