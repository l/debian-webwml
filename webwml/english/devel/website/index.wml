#use wml::debian::template title="Helping with the Debian Web Pages"

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Thank you for your interest in working on the Debian web
site. Due to the size of Debian and that the developers
are all volunteers, we have broken most tasks into more 
manageable pieces. Most work needed to help maintain the web
site does not involve programming so we can use the talents
of just about anyone.

<p>People helping with the web site in any capacity should
<a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe#debian-www">subscribe to the
<code>debian-www</code> mailing list</a>.
All discussions involving the web site are held there.

<p>Where you go from here depends on what you are interested in:
