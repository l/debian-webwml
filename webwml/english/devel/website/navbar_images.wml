#use wml::debian::template title="Creating the images for the navigation bar"

<p>This should be one of the first tasks done so that the navigation bar
images (the blue button-like images on the red bar, near the top of every
Debian web page) will be translated to your language, and thus readable by
users who don't speak English.

<p>Create the <code>Pics</code> directory and copy the <code>Makefile</code>
and <code>pics.conf</code> files from <code>webwml/english/Pics</code>
directory. Translate the strings in double quotes in the pics.conf file.

<p>Follow the instructions in webwml/english/Pics/README to install and
start the Gimp Perl server.

<p>Run <code>make pics</code>. Use an image viewing program to verify the
images look good, and similar to the English ones.

<p>If it worked, you're all set: commit the images and your translation will
be rebuilt to use those images.

<p>If it didn't work, you can copy the webwml/english/Pics/debbar.pl script
and edit it to suit your needs.

<P>Note that if any of the characters used in the navbar are not in the
ISO 8859-1 character set, then you will most likely need to either change
the font to one that includes your character set, or edit the images by hand.
We recommend the former solution.

<p>You can specify details about the text font in the pics.conf file using
the following variables:

<pre>
FONTFACE="fontname"
FONTSIZE="15"
FONTTYPE="bold"
FONTREGISTRY="registry"
FONTENCODING="encoding"
</pre>

<p>If you skip any of these, a default will be used, as specified in the
debbar.pl script. Hint: registry+encoding usually closely resembles the name
of the character set, so for example you can specify the ISO 8859-5 charset
with FONTREGISTRY="iso8859" and FONTENCODING="5". See the X font
documentation, or use programs such as xfontsel or gtkfontsel to figure this
out.

<p>Note that multibyte languages are not supported by this method.

<p>Send mail to <a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www</a>
list if you have any problems or questions.
