#use wml::debian::template title="Creating the Images for the Navbar"

<P>This should be one of the first tasks done so that once you start generating
pages the navbar links will be usable by users who don't speak english.
Create the Pics directory and copy the following files from webwml/english/Pics:
<pre>
   Makefile
   makebuttons.sh
   debbar.pl
</pre>
Translate the variables in makebuttons.sh and follow the instructions in that file.
This relies on the gimp which has been undergoing rapid development,
so the script breaks often. Send mail to debian-www if you have problems.

<P>Note that if any of the characters used in the navbar are not in the
iso8859-1 charset, then you will need to either change the font to one
for your charset, or edit the images by hand.
