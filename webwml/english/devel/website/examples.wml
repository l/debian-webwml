<H3>Example of Starting a Translation</H3>

<p>French will be used for the example:

<pre>
   cvs checkout webwml/Makefile.common webwml/english
   cd webwml
   mkdir french
   cvs add french
   cd french
   cp ../english/.wmlrc ../english/Make.* ../english/Makefile .
   cvs add Make* .wmlrc
</pre>

<p>Edit the <tt>.wmlrc</tt> file and change:
<ul>
  <li>'-D CUR_LANG=English' to '-D CUR_LANG=French'
  <li>'-D CUR_ISO_LANG=en' to '-D CUR_ISO_LANG=fr'
  <li>'-D CUR_LOCALE=en_US' to '-D CUR_LOCALE=fr_FR'
  <li>'-D CHARSET=iso-8859-1' to whatever is appropriate.<br>
      French just happens to use the same character encoding as English so no
      change is necessary, however it's likely that new languages will need
      to have this setting adjusted.
</ul>

<p>Edit Make.lang and change 'LANGUAGE := en' to 'LANGUAGE := fr'.
In case you are translating to a language which uses a multi-byte charset,
you may have to change some other variables in that file, for more
information read ../Makefile.common and perhaps other working examples
(translations such as Chinese).

<p>Edit english/template/debian/*.wml and add translations to all the
&lt;define-tag ...&gt; entries. This should be quite straightforward.

<p>Always make sure you copy the Makefile to each directory you translate.
This is necessary because the program <code>make</code> is used to convert
the .wml files into HTML, and <code>make</code> uses Makefiles.

<p>When you are done adding and editing pages, do a
<pre>
   cvs commit
</pre>
from the webwml directory. You can now start translating the pages.

<H3>Example of Translating a Page</H3>

<p>A French translation of the social contract will be used for the example:

<pre>
   cd webwml/french
   cp ../english/social_contract.wml .
   cvs add social_contract.wml
</pre>

<p>Edit social_contract.wml and translate the text. Do not try to translate
any links or change them in any way - if you want to change anything,
request it on the debian-www list. When done, type

<pre>
   cvs commit -m "short description of the changes you made" social_contract.wml
</pre>

<H3>Example of Adding a New Directory</H3>

<p>This example shows the French translation adding the intro/ directory:

<pre>
   cd webwml/french
   mkdir intro
   cvs add intro
   cd intro
   cp ../english/intro/Makefile .
</pre>

Make sure a new directory has the Makefile and that it's commited in CVS.
Otherwise, running make will give an error to everyone else trying it.

<pre>
   cvs add Makefile
   cd ..
   cvs commit -m "added the intro dir to CVS" intro
</pre>

#example not finished
# <H3>Example of a Conflict</H3>
#
# <p>This example shows a commit that won't work because the copy in the
# repository has been modified since your last <kbd>cvs update -d</kbd>.
#
# <pre>
#    cvs commit -m"fixed a broken link" foo.wml
# </pre>
#
# will output:
#
# <pre>
# cvs: Up-to-date check failed for foo.wml!
# cvs: fix the above errors first
# </pre>
#
# or something like that :)
