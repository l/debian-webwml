#use wml::debian::template title="Using CVS"

<p>CVS is a program to help manage having multiple people work on
the same material simultaneously. Every user creates a local copy
of the main repository. The local copies can be on the same machine,
or across the world. Users can then modify the local copy as they
wish and when the modified material is ready, commit the changes
back to the main repository.

<p>CVS will not let you commit a file if the copy in the main
repository has been modified since your last update. This is
not normally a problem as you can still update your local copy
If the modifications were to different parts than you were working
on, the changes are silently merged. If the changes affect the same area you
were working on, you will be warned that there is a conflict
and you need to edit the file to fix the problem before committing.

<P>In what follows anonymous access will be used as an example. If
you have access to another account which gives you write permission to
the repository then you should use that account instead. If you
are planning on making changes, you should get an account before
starting as anonymous users can not commit changes.

<p>If you are a Debian developer read the section on
<a href="#cvsfordevelopers">CVS Access for Debian Developers</a>

<p>To begin using CVS, you must first <code>login</code> to the CVS server
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml login
</pre>
(just hit return for the password for anonymous)

<P>To check out a copy of the wml files on your local machine, you need to use
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/&lt;lang&gt;
</pre>
where <code>&lt;lang&gt;</code> is the language you want. You will probably want
the English version in addition to the language you are working on.
If you only need a subset of the pages you can check out only those needed, e.g.
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/english/SPI</pre>.
or if you have been given a username/password, insert it instead of anonymous
<pre>cvs -d :pserver:username@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/english/SPI</pre>.

<P>From then on, you will not need to use the <code>'-d :pserver:...'</code> part.
Every few days you will want to do a
<pre>
   cvs update -d
</pre>
to retrieve any files from the repository which have changed.  The <code>-d</code> will add
any new directories, automatically.

<P>The following is for those who have write permission on the repository.
When you are done with a page, you can commit your changes to the repository using
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;dir&gt;   (to commit the changes in &lt;dir&gt;)
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit          (to commit all changes from the current dir down)
</pre>

<P>If you are the first person translating a page, you need to do
<pre>
   cvs add &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
before you commit it. Note that <code>cvs add</code> is not recursive so you need to
add a directory before you can add its contents.

<P>For more information on CVS, use <code>info cvs</code>.

<a name="cvsfordevelopers">
<H3>CVS Access for Debian Developers</H3>
<P>Since Debian developers already have an account on cvs.debian.org, a more
secure mechanism can be used to access the CVS repository. This method is preferred
over the :pserver: method given above.
You need to write to webmaster@debian.org asking for CVS access. Once you are added
to the group, simply set the environment variable CVS_RSH to ssh
('export CVS_RSH=ssh' in your .bashrc) and checkout the repository using the following:
<pre>
   cvs -d :ext:&lt;account_name&gt;@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/english/
</pre>

Once you have checked out the repository everything else works as in the previous section.
