<H1>Debian Web Pages TODO List</H1>

[first of all, why is this page .wml when it's raw .html? or better, why is
it raw .html when it can be .wml?]

<H2>Fairly important items</H2>

<H3>/</H3>

  <P>The index page should contain some basic information about the major
  aspects of Debian (project intro, getting the distro, getting support,
  development, misc) and link to subpages for details. For those who know
  what they are looking for, there's the site map.

<H3>/sitemap</H3>

  <P>Finish it :)

<H3>/donations and /partners/</H3>

  <P>Make a page for old donations, we don't want to forget the past ones,
  but they'd clutter up the page of current donations. Same for partners.

<H3>/ports/*/</H3>

  <P>All port specific information should be in the port pages. There still
  aren't any useful x86 port pages. Hint hint.

<H3>/intro/about</H3>

  <P>This page should be shortened and have the more detailed information in
  links. There has been a suggestion that we create an advocacy page with
  links to other free projects that Debian supports.

  <P>One example is licenses. I [treacy?] wrote a bit about them, but it
  really should be moved to its own page (see <tt>intro/license_disc.wml</tt>).
  We need to convince people that some licenses are better than others. Hmmm
  sounds like this should be linked from the advocacy page too.

  <P>Writing an intro to something like Debian is not an easy job. You
  really need to give some thought into how you split up all the
  (interconnected) issues involved.

<H3>/intro/advocacy</H3>

  <P>A new page as mentioned above. The LPF needs to be linked from here
  (this is what started the idea of an advocacy page).

  <P>This should probably be created only when someone has time to redo all
  the intro documents. I [treacy?] have a lot of ideas on this and will do
  it myself if I get enough time.

<H3>/News/weekly/</H3>

  <p>Since the weekly news have been discontinued (awww!), this needs to be
  less linked or something.

<H3>/doc/index</H3>

  <P>Many users are confused by the difference between the Documentation page
  and the Support page. Combining them makes a rather long page so that isn't
  really an option. I'm [treacy?] not sure what to do.

<H3>/distrib/vendors</H3>

  <p>This page needs to be split up. By country is probably too fine grained.
  Splitting them up by continent should work well.

  <P>All the vendors web sites need to be checked to see that they actually
  contribute.  They should also be checked after each major release of Debian.

  <P>Another solution would be to move it to a database-driven system.

  <P><I>This page is being maintained by Craig Small (csmall@debian.org)</I>

<H3>/consultants/index</H3>

  <p>This needs to be split up. (by continent, perhaps by country too)

<H3>/events/*/</H3>

  <p>Too much redundant stuff is left in the files translators touch; the
  same thing with .data files that we (treacy with some help from joy) did
  to security/ should be done here. Plus, this would make a single location
  where we change whether an event is past or current, which is a major
  hassle.

<H3>/vote/*/</H3>

  <p>Get the Project Secretary to verify all the pages that I [joy] wrote
  and marked as unchecked. I already asked Manoj about this but he said he
  first has to acquaint himself with the voting system.

  <p>Get the secretary to check out the pages completely. Maybe he could
  help us with updating it, too.

<H3>lists.debian.org or /MailingLists/</H3>

  <p>"We might want to put a note on lists.debian.org, pointing out that
  Debian reserves the right to archive any mail that comes into Debian."
  -- David Starner

<H3>/security/*/</H3>

  <p>Find the &lt;moreinfo&gt; entries for older years that contain mentions
  of lists-archives instead of including text from it or even linking to it,
  and correct it.

  <p>There are many advisories in 1997 and early 1998 that lack even the
  basic extra information -- find it and document it. Somehow. :)

  <p>Change the pages to have 'fixed in' info in a tag instead of page body,
  so that we can check for that tag in the template and not display 'Fixed
  in:' if it's empty.

<H3>/MailingLists/{,un}subscribe</H3>

  <p>Make it possible to translate every bit of text on these pages, not
  only the descriptions. This may require that parts of mklist are placed in
  .wml... or maybe not.

<H3>packages.debian.org</H3>

  <p>The major outstanding item is to generate pages for the non-i386 ports. 
  Anyone got ideas on doing this without replicating the entire page
  structure for each port? Having one page for each package name could be
  quite confusing. The pages could end up being quite long. To shorten the
  length a table would need to be made. How then to handle dependencies as
  they sometimes change between versions (and the different ports often have
  different versions of packages).

  <p>My [treacy?] current thoughts are to serve the pages dynamically. The
  prototype I created was too slow and there was a problem with postgres
  hanging every few days. Newer versions probably won't have that problem.

  <p>Any suggestions on this would be appreciated.

  <p>Note: we've been talking to James Troup about including copyright,
  changelog and index files for each package in a database like the pool
  database.

  <p>Another problem for packages.d.o is the search engine -- the quality
  column that swish++ generates is inverse and confusing.

  <p>"http://packages.debian.org/&lt;pkg&gt; doesn't seem to be prominently
  documented on our web pages." -- some user via Joey

<H2>Miscellaneous requests - deal with them as you wish</H2>

  I'll [treacy?] forward the mail he sent if it looks like you need more info
  [debian is mentioned atleast three times here: http://www.iversonsoftware.com/advscripts/prod-linux.idc]

  - I think it would be nice if the Dselect Beginners guide was also
  - mentioned and linked off of the Documentation page at
  - http://www.debian.org/doc/.  This is usually a big stumbling block
  - for beginners.
</PRE>

  It's linked from the DDP page, /doc/ddp. Maybe a link from
  /releases/*/ would be good, along with Installation manual links...

  <P>The main page currently has some links to the installation docs on
  ftp.debian.org and others on www.debian.org -- most on www.d.o, though.
  They should probably all use the web version as ftp.debian.org is
  overwhelmed (see next item though).

  <P>All links into the archive should allow the user to select the download
  site. The master mirror list could be used to keep the list of mirrors up
  to date (maybe even using a script). See
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist</code> and
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/mirror_list.pl</code> files.

  <P><em>The mirror list is maintained by the people at mirrors@debian.org.</em>

  <P>If we had cgi.debian.org on a less used and faster host, we could have
  more dynamic content on the web pages.

  If this is implemented, he included a submission. Mail me [treacy?] if you
  want it.  <code>intro/businesses.wml.wrk</code> seems to include this kind
  of stuff.

<H2>Content negotiation issues</H2>

  <p>The content negotiation system has several flaws that might make some
  people give up on our site. However, we can't do much about this.

  <p>When given `Accept-Language: *', which is a client behaviour that isn't
  defined by the RFC, Apache goes bezerk and shows the first available page,
  which is usually Chinese. The clients that send this are undoubtedly
  broken, but there are many of them (some versions of Internet Explorer,
  5.5?) so we can't ignore them. Jay filed a bug with Apache, but upstream
  chooses to stick with the RFC and doesn't care.

  <p>The /releases/potato/i386/install page seems to show up in Slovak way
  too often.

  <p>When given Accept-Language headers consisting of two parts, e.g. en-US,
  en-GB or nl-BE, Apache serves the Chinese page, at least on some mirrors.

<H2>Mirroring issues</H2>

  <p>Sites are supposed to create the file mirror/timestamps/&lt;host&gt;.
  It would be useful to have a script that will check the date in
  this file for each mirror so we can quickly know when a mirror
  is out of date.

  <p>We should reduce the number of web mirrors in Europe and increase the
  number of mirrors on other, less connected continents.

  <p>Making more mirrors pushed from www-master is also a goal.

  <p>Making sure whether each mirror has correct Apache configuration is a
  pain, but there doesn't seem to be a way around that.

  <p>Once we have all the mirrors set up just the way we like them, all
  maintained well and all pushed, we could `sell' them more, i.e. advertize
  them better. Perhaps by adding the &lt;select&gt; droplist at the top or
  the bottom of <strong>all</strong> web pages, not just the front page.
