<H1>Debian Web Pages TODO List</H1>

[first of all, why is this page .wml when it's raw .html? or better, why is
it raw .html when it can be .wml?]

<H2>Fairly important items</H2>

<H3>/</H3>

  <P>The index page should contain some basic information about the major
  aspects of Debian (project intro, getting the distro, getting support,
  development, misc) and link to subpages for details. For those who know
  what they are looking for, there's the site map.

<H3>/donations and /partners/</H3>

  <P>Make a page for old donations, we don't want to forget the past ones,
  but they'd clutter up the page of current donations. Same for partners.

<H3>/ports/*/</H3>

  <P>All port specific information should be in the port pages. There still
  aren't any useful x86 port pages. Hint hint.

<H3>/intro/about</H3>

  <P>This page should be shortened and have the more detailed information in
  links. There has been a suggestion that we create an advocacy page with
  links to other free projects that Debian supports.

  <P>One example is licenses. I [treacy?] wrote a bit about them, but it
  really should be moved to its own page (see <tt>intro/license_disc.wml</tt>).
  We need to convince people that some licenses are better than others. Hmmm
  sounds like this should be linked from the advocacy page too.

  <P>Writing an intro to something like Debian is not an easy job. You
  really need to give some thought into how you split up all the
  (interconnected) issues involved.

<H3>/intro/advocacy</H3>

  <P>A new page as mentioned above. The LPF needs to be linked from here
  (this is what started the idea of an advocacy page).

  <P>This should probably be created only when someone has time to redo all
  the intro documents. I [treacy?] have a lot of ideas on this and will do
  it myself if I get enough time.

<H3>/News/weekly/</H3>

  <p>Figure out how to fix #<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/82852">82852</a>.

<H3>/doc/index</H3>

  <P>Many users are confused by the difference between the Documentation page
  and the Support page. Combining them makes a rather long page so that isn't
  really an option. I'm [treacy?] not sure what to do.

<H3>/distrib/vendors</H3>

  <p>This page needs to be split up. By country is probably too fine grained.
  Splitting them up by continent should work well.

  <P>All the vendors web sites need to be checked to see that they actually
  contribute.  They should also be checked after each major release of Debian.

  <P>Another solution would be to move it to a database-driven system.

  <P><I>This page is being maintained by Craig Small (csmall@debian.org)</I>

<H3>/consultants/index</H3>

  <p>This needs to be split up. (by continent, perhaps by country too)

<H3>/events/*/</H3>

  <p>Too much redundant stuff is left in the files translators touch; the
  same thing with .data files that we (treacy with some help from joy) did
  to security/ should be done here. Plus, this would make a single location
  where we change whether an event is past or current, which is a major
  hassle.

<H3>/Pics/</H3>

  <p>Add a navbar image for the site map.

  <p>Convert the navbar images to PNG.

  <p>Figure out how to use debbar.pl for the doublebyte (ja, kr, zh)
  languages, if at all possible.

  <p>Remove cruft like the "Debian GNU/Linux" banner or the non-rounded
  "debian" banner.

<H3>/vote/*/</H3>

  <p>Get the Project Secretary to verify all the pages that I [joy] wrote
  and marked as unchecked. I already asked Manoj about this but he said he
  first has to acquaint himself with the voting system.

  <p>Get the secretary to check out the pages completely. Maybe he could
  help us with updating it, too.

  <p>Figure out if we should keep basic+votebar templates, instead of just
  one template ("votepage" or something).

<H3>packages.debian.org</H3>

  <p>The oldest major outstanding item is to generate pages for the non-i386
  ports. Anyone got ideas on doing this without replicating the entire page
  structure for each port? Having one page for each package name could be
  quite confusing. The pages could end up being quite long. To shorten the
  length a table would need to be made. How then to handle dependencies as
  they sometimes change between versions (and the different ports often have
  different versions of packages).

  <p>My [treacy?] current thoughts are to serve the pages dynamically. The
  prototype I created was too slow and there was a problem with postgres
  hanging every few days. Newer versions probably won't have that problem.

  <p>Any suggestions on this would be appreciated.

  <p>tbm's suggestion: "you simply have to merge all package files together
  to one, see master:~tbm/htmlscripts/merge-package-files.pl" --
  someone needs to investigate that.

  <p>Note: we've been talking to James Troup about including copyright,
  changelog and index files for each package in a database like the pool
  database.

  <p>Another problem for packages.d.o is the search engine -- the method
  swish++ uses to sort the list of results (previously shown as the "quality"
  column) is inverse and confusing.

  <p>"http://packages.debian.org/&lt;pkg&gt; doesn't seem to be prominently
  documented on our web pages." -- some user via Joey

  <p>We don't check and remove files for packages that have disappeared.
  We could fix this by making the pages in a temporary directory and moving
  the new directory into place when done, but doing this would disrupt the
  process of regenerating only those pages that have changed.

  <p>The scripts have been modified to regenerate the pages from scratch
  once a week as a temporary remedy.

<H3>/sitemap</H3>

  <P>Beautify it, somehow? Maybe we should emphasize some major pages by
  making them &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;.

<H3>lists.debian.org</H3>

  <p>"We might want to put a note on lists.debian.org, pointing out that
  Debian reserves the right to archive any mail that comes into Debian."
  -- David Starner

  <p>There's now a note to that effect in /MailingLists/.

  <p>Around 2001-05-30 Apache on lists.d.o / cgi.d.o decided not to accept
  any arguments to its CGIs. Restarting it helped. Go figure.

<H3>/security/*/</H3>

  <p>Find the &lt;moreinfo&gt; entries for older years that contain mentions
  of lists-archives instead of including text from it or even linking to it,
  and correct it.

  <p>There are many advisories in 1997 and early 1998 that lack even the
  basic extra information -- find it and document it. Somehow. :)

  <p>Change the pages to have 'fixed in' info in a tag instead of page body,
  so that we can check for that tag in the template and not display 'Fixed
  in:' if it's empty.

<H3>/MailingLists/{,un}subscribe</H3>

  <p>Split it up by section? Perhaps, if it grows too much...

<H2>Content negotiation issues</H2>

  <p>The content negotiation system has several flaws that might make some
  people give up on our site. However, we can't do much about this. Most of
  it is caused by clients sending non-RFC strings in the Accept-Language
  header, which makes Apache go bezerk and apply some of its illogical
  methods of serving smallest available files.

  <p>When given `Accept-Language: *', the first available page will be
  served, and that's usually Chinese. The clients that send this are
  undoubtedly broken, but there are many of them (some versions of Internet
  Explorer, 5.5?) so we can't ignore them.

  <p>Jay said he once filed a bug with Apache, but upstream chooses to stick
  with the RFC and doesn't care about any exceptions.

  <p>The /releases/potato/i386/install page seems to show up in Slovak way
  too often.

  <p>When given Accept-Language headers consisting of two parts, e.g. en-US,
  en-GB or nl-BE, the Chinese page is served, at least on some mirrors.

  <p>When there exists a file of unknown language, i.e. an unrecognized
  foo.*.html file with no AddLanguage or LanguagePriority setting, and when
  the client sends an Accept-Language which contains only unavailable
  languages, the former file will be served.

<H2>Mirroring issues</H2>

  <p>Sites are supposed to create the file mirror/timestamps/&lt;host&gt;.
  Jay has made scripts that check the date in this file for each mirror so
  we can know when a mirror is out of date, see mirror/timestamps/*.py.

  <p>We should reduce the number of web mirrors in Europe and increase the
  number of mirrors on other, less connected continents.

  <p>Making more mirrors pushed from www-master is also a goal.

  <p>Making sure whether each mirror has correct Apache configuration is a
  pain, but there doesn't seem to be a way around that.

  <p>Once we have all the mirrors set up just the way we like them, all
  maintained well and all pushed, we could `sell' them more, i.e. advertize
  them better. Perhaps by adding the &lt;select&gt; droplist at the top or
  the bottom of <strong>all</strong> web pages, not just the front page.

<H2>Wrong URLs</H2>

  <p>Links to external pages have to be checked if they are still
  correct.  James Treacy has updated the URL check of the Debian pages.
  As usual, the results can be found at
  <a href="http://people.debian.org/~treacy/urlcheck/">http://people.debian.org/~treacy/urlcheck/</a>.
  Broken links have to be removed.  This is more of a permanent task.

<H2>Miscellaneous requests - deal with them as you wish</H2>

  I'll [treacy?] forward the mail he sent if it looks like you need more info
  [debian is mentioned atleast three times here: http://www.iversonsoftware.com/advscripts/prod-linux.idc]

  - I think it would be nice if the Dselect Beginners guide was also
  - mentioned and linked off of the Documentation page at
  - http://www.debian.org/doc/.  This is usually a big stumbling block
  - for beginners.
</PRE>

  It's linked from the DDP page, /doc/ddp. Maybe a link from
  /releases/*/ would be good, along with Installation manual links...

  <P>The main page currently has some links to the installation docs on
  ftp.debian.org and others on www.debian.org -- most on www.d.o, though.
  They should probably all use the web version as ftp.debian.org is
  overwhelmed (see next item though).

  <P>All links into the archive should allow the user to select the download
  site. The master mirror list could be used to keep the list of mirrors up
  to date (maybe even using a script). See
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist</code> and
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/mirror_list.pl</code> files.

  <P><em>The mirror list is maintained by the people at mirrors@debian.org.</em>

  <P>If we had cgi.debian.org on a less used and faster host, we could have
  more dynamic content on the web pages.

  If this is implemented, he included a submission. Mail me [treacy?] if you
  want it.  <code>intro/businesses.wml.wrk</code> seems to include this kind
  of stuff.

  <p>Javier suggested adding Joey's
  <a href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/webwml">webwml-stattrans</a> to
  www.debian.org and maybe adding translation tags to it.

  <p>Javier suggested wider deployment of stuff like
  <a href="$(HOME)/international/french/a-relire.fr.html">this</a> and
  <a href="$(HOME)/international/spanish/a-traducir.es.html">this</a>.

  <p>Javier suggested making DDP pages account for translations,
  automatically.

  <p>Joey said:

I'd rather like to see a note on the security pages like:

  Please note that we cannot guarantee that an intruder gets access to
  our servers since they are connected to the internet.  In such a
  case an evil third party could potential modify uploads to
  security.debian.org and modify web pages containing MD5 sums.  We
  are, however, trying our best to prohibit this.  Please be advised
  that there is no 100% security, only improvements to the current
  situation.

Joy should rephrase it probably. :)

  <p>"Vernon Balbert" <vbalbert@mediaone.net> suggested we make it clear
  which kernel version is used in the latest version of Debian.
