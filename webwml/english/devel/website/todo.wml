<toc-add-entry name="important">Fairly important items</toc-add-entry>

<h3>/donations and /partners/</h3>

  <P>Make a page for old donations, we don't want to forget the past ones,
  but they'd clutter up the page of current donations. Same for partners.

  <p>Separate huge chunks of non-translatable data from the donations page.
  See /mirror/official_sponsors for a start.

<h3>/ports/</h3>

  <p>All port specific information should be in the port pages.
  (More of a long-standing wishlist that can't ever be fixed. :)

  <p>Review the ports listed as unmaintained in the port.maintainers file
  and fix them.

  <p>Import the sh port pages.

<h3>/intro/about</h3>

  <P>This page should be shortened and have the more detailed information in
  links. There has been a suggestion that we create an advocacy page with
  links to other free projects that Debian supports.

  <P>One example is licenses. I [treacy?] wrote a bit about them, but it
  really should be moved to its own page (see <tt>intro/license_disc.wml</tt>).
  We need to convince people that some licenses are better than others. Hmmm
  sounds like this should be linked from the advocacy page too.

  <P>Writing an intro to something like Debian is not an easy job. You
  really need to give some thought into how you split up all the
  (interconnected) issues involved.

<h3>/intro/advocacy</h3>

  <P>A new page as mentioned above. The LPF needs to be linked from here
  (this is what started the idea of an advocacy page).

  <P>This should probably be created only when someone has time to redo all
  the intro documents. I [treacy?] have a lot of ideas on this and will do
  it myself if I get enough time.

<h3>/CD/vendors/</h3>

  <P>All the vendors web sites need to be checked to see that they actually
  contribute.  They should also be checked after each major release of Debian.

  <P>Another solution would be to move it to a database-driven system.
  There's already some sort of an internal database that only Craig knows
  about.

  <P><I>This page is being maintained by Craig Small (csmall@debian.org)</I>

<h3>/consultants/index</h3>

  <p>This needs to be split up. (by continent, perhaps by country too)

<h3>/events/*/</h3>

  <p>Too much redundant stuff is left in the files translators touch; the
  same thing with .data files that we (treacy with some help from joy) did
  to security/ should be done here. Plus, this would make a single location
  where we change whether an event is past or current, which is a major
  hassle.

<h3>/doc/books</h3>

  <p>The tags for title, author, language, url, and available should be
  separated from the translatable portion of the page.

<h3>/vote/*/</h3>

  <p>Get the secretary to (help) maintain these pages.

  <p>Figure out if we should keep basic+votebar templates, instead of just
  one template ("votepage" or something).

<h3>packages.debian.org</h3>

  <p>You can find a current <a
  href="http://git.debian.org/?p=webwml/packages.git;f=TODO;hb=HEAD">TODO
  list</a> in the <a
  href="http://git.debian.org/?p=webwml/packages.git;a=summary">Git
  repository</a>.</p>

  <p><i>The scripts are currently maintained by Frank 'djpig' Lichtenheld and
  Martin 'Joey' Schulze.</i></p>

<h3>/ports/{hurd,beowulf}</h3>

  <p>Move these out of ports because they aren't Linux ports. (Rename
  /ports/, too?)

<h3>/sitemap</h3>

  <p>Maybe we should emphasize some major pages by making them
  &lt;strong&gt; or &lt;em&gt;.

<h3>lists.debian.org</h3>

  <p>"We might want to put a note on lists.debian.org, pointing out that
  Debian reserves the right to archive any mail that comes into Debian."
  -- David Starner

  <p>There's now a note to that effect in /MailingLists/.

  <p>Around 2001-05-30 Apache on lists.d.o / cgi.d.o decided not to accept
  any arguments to its CGIs. Restarting it helped. Go figure.

<h3>/security/*/</h3>

  <p>Find the &lt;moreinfo&gt; entries for older years that contain mentions
  of lists-archives instead of including text from it or even linking to it,
  and correct it.

  <p>There are many advisories in 1997 and early 1998 that lack even the
  basic extra information -- find it and document it. Somehow. :)

  <p>Change the pages to have 'fixed in' info in a tag instead of page body,
  so that we can check for that tag in the template and not display 'Fixed
  in:' if it's empty.

<h3>/ports/i386/</h3>

  <p>Make the x86 port pages more useful... somehow :)

<h3>/MailingLists/{,un}subscribe</h3>

  <p>Split it up by section? Perhaps, if it grows too much...

  <p>This is already partially remedied by having various
  http://lists.debian.org/foo pages include a sub/unsub form.

  <p>Make a note about the anti-abuse check.

<h3>/misc/memberships</h3>

  <p>Collect remaining missing representatives of Debian in other places,
  verify/maintain the current ones.

<h3>/devel/website/*</h3>

  <p>Code all the remaining best current practices.

<toc-add-entry name="cn">Content negotiation issues</toc-add-entry>

  <p>The content negotiation system has several flaws that might make some
  people give up on our site. However, we can't do much about this. Most of
  it is caused by clients sending non-RFC strings in the Accept-Language
  header, which makes Apache go bezerk and apply some of its illogical
  methods of serving smallest available files.

  <p>When given "*" in the Accept-Language header, the first available page
  will be served, and that's most likely not English, rather Arabic or
  Chinese. This is especially problematic when the user's language
  preference is a two-part language code (like "en-ca" or "nl-BE") followed
  by a "*".

  <p>Apache 1.3 sticks with the RFC here. Apache 2.0's code will imply a
  en or nl respectively, but it will be low priority so it probably won't
  help with e.g. "en-ca, fr-ca, *".

  <p>Also, when there exists a file of unknown language, i.e. an unrecognized
  foo.*.html file with no AddLanguage or LanguagePriority setting, and when
  the client sends an Accept-Language which contains only unavailable
  languages, the former file will be served.

  <p>This happened most often with the /releases/potato/i386/install page,
  because there's a Slovak variant of it and we didn't have that language
  set up in Apache because there's no web site translation in Slovak.
  We've alleviated the problem by including sk in the Apache config files,
  but as usual, changes don't propagate to all of the mirrors fast.

<toc-add-entry name="mirroring">Mirroring issues</toc-add-entry>

  <p>Sites are supposed to create the file mirror/timestamps/&lt;host&gt;.
  Jay has made scripts that check the date in this file for each mirror so
  we can know when a mirror is out of date, see mirror/timestamps/*.py.

  <p>We should reduce the number of web mirrors in Europe and increase the
  number of mirrors on other, less connected continents.

  <p>Making all mirrors pushed (from www-master if possible) is also a goal.

  <p>Making sure whether each mirror has correct Apache configuration is a
  pain, but there doesn't seem to be a way around that. Phil Hands suggested
  that the "AddLanguage" stuff is put into a wgettable file and that we make
  a Perl script that would automatically update people's Apache config
  files.

  <P>All links into the archive should allow the user to select the download
  site. The master mirror list could be used to keep the list of mirrors up
  to date (maybe even using a script). See
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/Mirrors.masterlist</code> and
  <code>webwml/english/mirror/mirror_list.pl</code> files.

  <P><em>The mirror list is maintained by the people at mirrors@debian.org.</em>

<toc-add-entry name="wrongurls">Wrong URLs</toc-add-entry>

  <p>Links to external pages have to be checked if they are still
  correct.  James Treacy has written a small Python script for this
  purpose. Frank Lichtenheld is currently
  maintaining the script, the (daily updated) results can be found at
  <url "http://www-master.debian.org/build-logs/urlcheck/" />.
  Broken links have to be removed.  This is more of a permanent task.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="misc">Miscellaneous requests</toc-add-entry>

  <p><strong>Deal with these as you wish.</strong></p>

  <P>If we had cgi.debian.org on a less used and faster host, we could have
  more dynamic content on the web pages.

  <p>Finish merging <code>intro/businesses.wml.wrk</code> into
  <code>users/</code>. Make the latter use the toc template.

  <p>Javier suggested making DDP pages account for translations,
  automatically.

  <p>Joey said:
<blockquote>
<p>I'd rather like to see a note on the security pages like:</p>

<p>
  Please note that we cannot guarantee that an intruder gets access to
  our servers since they are connected to the internet.  In such a
  case an evil third party could potential modify uploads to
  security.debian.org and modify web pages containing MD5 sums.  We
  are, however, trying our best to prohibit this.  Please be advised
  that there is no 100% security, only improvements to the current
  situation.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joey should rephrase it probably. :)</p>

  <p>Should be added to /security/faq.</p>

  <p>"Vernon Balbert" &lt;vbalbert@mediaone.net&gt; suggested we make it
  clear which kernel version is used in the latest version of Debian.

  <p>Matti Airas &lt;mairas@iki.fi&gt; suggested "doing language selection
  with Apache mod_rewrite. Instead of having to explicitly go to
  http://www.debian.org/intro/about.en.html (or some mirror), I could go to
  http://www.debian.org/en/intro/about, which mod_rewrite then could replace
  with the correct url." Note that this would require additional hacks in
  order not to break relative links.</p>


  <p>Chris Tillman suggested:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is often confusion about which machines
Debian supports and which we don't, yet. There is a bewildering array of
machines, not to mention network cards, displays, mice, video cards, sound
cards, port types, and so forth which an individual system might
mix-and-match. Many of the Ports pages are out of date.

<p>Debian supports a *lot* of systems. I think it would make sense to start
trying to list which ones, specifically. Also, it would be really nice to
know which ones aren't supported, both for new would-be users and for
developers as a todo list.

<p>I think the easiest way to achieve this, would be to provide a web page
where people could enter in their system components, preferably chosen from
a list of known components with an 'other' capability. Then, they could also
enter a thumbs-up or thumbs-down, on Debian on that architecture. Also any
specific problems.

<p>Then after submission of the user's hardware specs, the system can show a
(dated) list of previous user's experiences with those components.

<p>We should also need to sprinkle pointers to this page into the install
documentation, FAQs, probably even put a link on the front Debian page.
