<title>Debian Web Pages TODO List</title>

<H1>Debian Web Pages TODO List</H1>

<H3>/ports/*/</H3>

  <P>All port specific information should be in the port pages. There still
  aren't any x86 port pages. Hint hint.

<H3>/intro/about</H3>

  <P>This page should be shortened and have the more detailed information in
  links. There has been a suggestion that we create an advocacy page with
  links to other free projects that Debian supports.

  <P>One example is licenses. I wrote a bit about them, but it really should be
  moved to its own page. We need to convince people that some licenses
  are better than others. Hmmm sounds like this should be linked from the
  advocacy page too.

  <P>Writing an intro to something like Debian is not an easy job. You really
  need to give some thought into how you split up all the (interconnected)
  issues involved.

  <P>The 'History of Debian' needs to be filled in. It's a document called
  "Debian Project History", it's linked from doc/ddp.

<H3>/intro/advocacy</H3>

  <P>A new page as mentioned above. The LPF needs to be linked from here (this
  is what started the idea of an advocacy page).

  <P>This should probably be created only when someone has time to redo all the
  intro documents. I have a lot of ideas on this and will do it myself if I get	
  enough time.

<H3>/doc/index</H3>

  <P>suggestion submitted: "Matt Welsh's `Installation and Getting Started',
  the `Linux System Admin Guide', and a few like that would be good
  starters."

  <P>Many users are confused by the difference between the Documentation page
  and the Support page. Combining them makes a rather long page so that isn't
  really an option. I'm not sure what to do.

<H3>/distrib/vendors</H3>

  <p>This page needs to be split up. By country is probably too fine grained.
  Splitting them up by continent should work well.

  <P>All the vendors web sites need to be checked to see that they actually
  contribute.  They should also be checked after each major release of Debian.

  <P><I>This page is being maintained by Craig Small (csmall@debian.org)</I>

<H3>Consultants</H3>
  This needs to be split up.

<H3>/Packages/*</H3>

<p>The only outstanding item is to generate pages for the non-i386 ports.
Anyone got ideas on doing this without replicating the entire page structure
for each port? Having one page for each package name could be quite
confusing. The pages could end up being quite long. To shorten the length a
table would need to be made. How then to handle dependencies as they
sometimes change between versions (and the different ports often have
different versions of packages).

<p>My current thoughts are to serve the pages dynamically. The prototype I
created was too slow and there was a problem with postgres hanging every
few days. Newer versions probably won't have that problem.

<p>Any suggestions on this would be appreciated.

<H3>/misc/awards</H3>

<p>We need to create an Awards and Recognition Page for all our awards... such as the Corel letter, the
Best of the Net, the other one that I forgot.... but is in the October news
section and any old ones we've got.

<p>The Partners program is like a recognition page for our partners.

<H3>Miscellaneous requests - deal with them as you wish</H3>

  I'll forward the mail he sent if it looks like you need more info
  [debian is mentioned atleast three times here: http://www.iversonsoftware.com/advscripts/prod-linux.idc]

  WNPP should be moving to `wnpp' entry in BTS soon, let's postpone this
  until those changes are done.

  - I think it would be nice if the Dselect Beginners guide was also
  - mentioned and linked off of the Documentation page at
  - http://www.debian.org/doc/.  This is usually a big stumbling block
  - for beginners.
</PRE>

  It's linked from the DDP page, /doc/ddp. Maybe a link from
  /releases/*/ would be good, along with Installation manual links...

  <P>The main page currently has some links to the installation docs on
  ftp.debian.org and others on www.debian.org -- most on www.d.o, though.
  They should probably all use the web version as ftp.debian.org is
  overwhelmed (see next item though).

  <P>All links into the archive should allow the user to select the download
  site.  Jason Gunthorpe has been coordinating an improved mirror list which
  could be used to keep the list of mirrors up to date (maybe even using a
  script).

  <P>If we had cgi.debian.org on a not-used and fast host (hint: lully), we
  could have more dynamic content on the web pages.

  If this is implemented, he included a submission. Mail me if you want it.

<H3>Mirroring issues</H3>

  <p>Sites are supposed to create the file mirror/timestamps/<host>.
  It would be useful to have a script that will check the date in
  this file for each mirror so we can quickly know when a mirror
  is out of date.
