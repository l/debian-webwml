#use wml::debian::template title="Using WML"

This assumes that you have WML installed on your machine.
WML is available as a
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/wml.html">Debian package</a>.

<p>Simply type <kbd>make</kbd> in webwml/&lt;lang&gt;. If you do a <kbd>make install</kbd>
then the html files will be placed in the directory <kbd>../../debian.org/</kbd>.

<p>Multi-byte languages may need special pre- or post-processing of the .wml files
in order to handle the character set properly. This can be done by changing
the variables <kbd>WMLPROLOG</kbd> and <kbd>WMLEPILOG</kbd>.
in <kbd>webwml/&lt;lang&gt;/Make.lang</kbd> appropriately.
Depending on how your <kbd>WMLEPILOG</kbd> program works, you may need to change
the value of <kbd>WMLOUTFILE</kbd>.
See the Japanese or Chinese translations for an example.

<p>One of the things you will encounter in WML is slices. For our purposes
here, you can consider as one possible choice out of a number of options.
An simple example will show what we mean.
<pre><protect>
   [EN:the salad:]
   [DE:der Salat:]
</protect></pre>
In this case, there are two slices, one in English and one in German.
To add a slice, simply add a new one in your language. For example,
<pre><protect>
   [EN:the salad:]
   [DE:der Salat:]
   [FR:la salade:]
</protect></pre>
When you run WML on a file, it will automatically select the slices
appropriate for your translation and ignore the others.

<p>Please keep the slices sorted alphabetically, with an exception for the
English (EN) slice.

<h2>Using Perl in WML</h2>

<p>One of the features of WML that we make extensive use of is the use of Perl.
Remember, these are not dynamic pages. Perl is used at the time the HTML
pages are generated to do, well, whatever you like. Two good examples of how
we are using Perl in the pages is to create the list of most recent news items for
the main page and to generate the links to translations at the end of the page.

<p>The documentation for WML is not easy to learn from. It is actually quite
complete, but until you begin to understand how it works (and it is quite
powerful) it is easiest to learn from examples. You may find template files
used for the Debian site useful. They can be found in
<code>english/template/debian/</code>.

<h2>Required version</h2>

<p>Our web site requires <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/web/wml.html">\
wml version &gt;= 2.0.6</a>.</p>

<p>This version isn't included in the stable distribution (potato).
For those of you who don't want to switch to the other distributions but
stay with the stable one, there are
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~joey/webwml/debs/">backported packages
available</a>.</p>
