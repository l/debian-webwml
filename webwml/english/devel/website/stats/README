Translators: in order to provide translated statistics, you just need
to add a webwml/$lang/devel/website/stats directory with a minimal
Makefile (see webwml/french/devel/website/stats/Makefile) and translate
the stats.$ll.po file.

Chinese build is currently broken due to deprecated encoding of Spanish
(characters in maintainer names of outdated translation), it can only
be added as soon as Spanish moves to UTF-8 (of once Spanish
translations are up to date ;-).
