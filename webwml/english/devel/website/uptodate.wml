#use wml::debian::template title="Keeping web site translations up-to-date"

<P>Since web pages aren't static, it is a good idea to keep track of which
version of the original a certain translation refers to, and to use this
information to check which pages have changed since the last translation.
This information should be embedded at the top of the document in this form:

<ul><pre>
\#use wml::debian::translation-check translation="X.x"
</pre></ul>

where <var>X.x</var> is the CVS version number of the original (English).
You can get this number looking in CVS/Entries which is in the format:
<tt>/file_name/X.x/date//</tt>. You can also get it by running
<code>cvs status file_name</code> in the English source directory.

<P>This is also useful because some translations may not get updated for
quite some time, even though the original language (English) does. Due to
content negotiation, the reader of the translated language may not be aware
of this and might miss important information, introduced in new versions of
the original. The <code>translation-check</code> template contains code to
check if your translation is outdated, and output appropriate message
warning the user about it.

<P>There are also some additional parameters that you can use on the
<code>#use</code> line:

<blockquote><dl>
 <dt><code>original="<em>language</em>"</code>
 <dd>where <em>language</em> is the name of the language you are translating
 from, if not english.
 The name must correspond to the top-level subdirectory in the CVS, and to
 the name in <code>languages.wml</code> template.

 <dt><code>mindelta="<em>number</em>"</code>
 <dd>which defines the maximum difference in CVS revisions before the
 translation is considered aged.
 The default value is <b>2</b>.
 For important pages, set it to <b>1</b>, which means that every change is
 considered making the translation aged.

 <dt><code>maxdelta="<em>number</em>"</code>
 <dd>which defines the maximum difference in CVS revisions before the
 translation is considered to be outdated.
 The default value is <b>5</b>.
 For very important pages, set it to be less.
 A value of <b>1</b> means that every change is considered making the
 translation outdated.
</dl></blockquote>

<P>Additionally, the script <code>check_trans.pl</code> is available in the
webwml/ directory, which will show you a report on pages needing updates:

<ul><pre>
check_trans.pl <var>language</var>
</pre></ul>

where <var>language</var> is the directory name that contains your
translation, e.g. "swedish".

Pages that lack translation will be shown as
"<code>Missing <var>filename</var></code>", and pages that are not up to
date with the original will be shown as
"<code>NeedToUpdate <var>filename</var> to version <var>x.y</var></code>".

<P>If you want to see what the exact changes are, you can get the
differences by adding <code>-d</code> command line option to the above
command. Please note that this can take a while since it can include
several accesses to the CVS server.

<P>If you want to ignore warnings on missing pages (for instance old news
items), you can create a file called <code>.transignore</code> in the
directory where you want to suppress the warnings, listing each file that
you are not going to translate, with one name per line.
