#use wml::debian::template title="Keeping translations up-to-date"

<P>Since web pages aren't static, it is a good idea to keep track of which
version of the original a certain translation refers to, and to use this
information to check which pages have changed since the last translation.
To aid with this, the script <code>check_trans.pl</code> is available in
the webwml directory.

<P>The script relies on the translated wml file containing information on
which version of the original it is a translation of.
This information should be embedded somewhere in the document in the form
<code>&lt;!--translation <var>x.x</var>--&gt;</code> where <var>x.x</var>
is the version of the original (English).
The string should be written on its own line in the wml file, optionally
prefixed by a <code>#</code> (wml comment) so it isn't added it to the final
HTML file.

<P>If you run <code>check_trans.pl <var>language</var></code> (replace
<var>language</var> with the directory name that contains your translation,
like "swedish") you will get a report on pages that lack translation (shown
as "<code>Missing <var>filename</var></code>") and pages that are not
up-to-date (shown as "<code>NeedToUpdate <var>filename</var> to version
<var>x.x</var></code>").

<P>If you want to see what the exact changes are, you can get the
differences by running <code>check_trans.pl -d <var>language</var></code>.
Please note that this can take a while since it can include several accesses
to the CVS server.

<P>If you want to ignore warnings on missing pages (for instance old news
items), you can create a file called <code>.transignore</code> in the
directory where you want to suppress the warnings, listing each file that
you are not going to translate, with one name per line.
