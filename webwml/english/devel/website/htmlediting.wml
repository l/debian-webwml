<toc-add-entry name="preface">Preface</toc-add-entry>

<p>This page should help editors and translators to form well tagged pages.
It contains hints about tag usage and how to create new pages and make them
more easy to translate.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="general">Some general hints</toc-add-entry>
<p>For now pages or translations here a list of general advices</p>
<dl>
<dt>do not use long lines<dt>
<dd>
The wml files and other files should have lines fitting in a normal 
termimanl window. This is easier to edit in vi, better searchable and 
easier to translate.
</dd>
</dl>
<dt>keep tags in seperate lines if possible</dt>
<dd>
Most HTML tags can be kept in seperate lines some of them are DIV, P, TABLE,
UL. To make things easier for translators, you should keep all tags, that can
be used this way in seperate lines. Else translators sometimes delete tags
accidentily sometimes and forget to restore them after translating.
</dd>
<dt>do not use spaces or line breaks in inline tags</dt>
<dd>Some tags produce a space, if they are kept in seperate lines. One
of those is the Q tag for small citations or quotes. You may only separate them
as a whole with conten in one line. Else there might be a space between content
and tag in the HTML page afterwords. Betwenn words in these tags you may
have as many line breaks or spaces as you want.
</dd>
</dl>

<toc-add-entry name="abbreviations">Abbreviations and Acronyms</toc-add-entry>
<p>
For abbreviations and acronyms the HTML tag &lt;acronym&gt; should be used.
There are two reasons why not to use the ABBR tag: First not all browsers do
support it and second there are inconsistent definitions about what is an
acronym and what is an abbreviatition.
</p>
<p>
An acronym is added to the page in the following syntax: 
<code>&lt;acronym lang="language code" title="Full definition of
acronym"&gt;ACRONYM&lt;acronym&gt</code>. The title Are the full spoken words 
If the acronym is build from word beginnings, those letters should be upper 
case in the title. The lang attribute is only needed, if the acronym or 
abbreviations is in a foreign language.
</p>
<p>
There is already a set of common acronyms in the wml templates 
included to use it in your page, you have to add a line to use 
<code>acronyms</code> in the wml file. The wml tag for DD eg. is
&lt;acronym_DD /&gt;.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="citations">Citations and Quotes</toc-add-entry>
<p>
There are several different rules what a citation or quote is for different 
languages. If you have a short citation inline you have to use the Q tag.
The rendering of the content is handled by language CSS. Q tags must not have
a space or line break between the opening and closiong tag and the content.
</p>
<p>
For longer citations the tag blockquote is used. A blockquote encloses one
ore more paragraphs of text, which are marked as P. Please do not use 
the blockquote tags for centering any block of text which is not a
citation. Blockquotes are exclusively for citations and will be rendered 
by language css in the future.
</p>
<p>
There is also a cite tag in HTML. The cite tag is not used for the 
citation text itself. It is used for the source of a citation. This can be 
the name of the person, the citation is from and if added as attribute
to a blockquote an URL.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="code">Program Names and Code</toc-add-entry>
<p>
For program names and computer code there is a tag named CODE. Browsers
normally know about displaying code and program names, but rendering 
can also be changed by CSS. It is not a good idea to use $lt;tt&gt; 
instead as this does not say anything about the content.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="samp">Samples of Computer Output</toc-add-entry>
<p>For computer output on the screen there is a special tag named samp. If 
you have a larger block of computer output, you should also have
a look into the css file, if there is a special class for it.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="kbd">Keyboard Input</toc-add-entry>
<p>If there are examples, where the user has to type something on the
keybord, the KBD tag is used for the user input. See  also the chapter
about <a href="#var">variables</a> for how to tag the variable input.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="var">Variables</toc-add-entry>
<p>
Sometimes we have to point out something is variable input reqeuested as
we do not know the special IP address or the users name which has to be 
given in a program call on command line. For these variable inputs the var 
tag is used.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="pre">Preformatted Content</toc-add-entry>
<p>
The PRE tag is use for preformatted tes only. Line length, spaces and
other things will preservered. Naturally this tag cannot contain most
of the other HTML tags.
</p>

<toc-add-entry name="img">Images</toc-add-entry>
<p>
If there are images added in the page, ther is not need to add an invalid
border=0 at attribute. But if possible the image size and an alt attribute
should
be added. The size is added by wml if not present, but that needs compile
time. The alt attribute should contain something, taht tells users browsing
with lynx and blind people what is in the image.
