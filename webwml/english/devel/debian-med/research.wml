 <p>
 PyEPL is a stimuli delivery and response registration toolkit to be
 used for generating psychology (as well as neuroscience, marketing
 research, and other) experiments.
 </p><p>
 It provides
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>presentation: both visual and auditory stimuli</li>
   <li>responses registration: both manual (keyboard/joystick) and
       sound (microphone) time-stamped</li>
   <li>sync-pulsing: synchronizing your behavioral task with external
       acquisition hardware</li>
   <li>flexibility of encoding various experiments due to the use of
       Python as a description language</li>
   <li>fast execution of critical points due to the calls to linked
       compiled libraries</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 This toolbox is here to be an alternative for a widely used
 commercial product E'(E-Prime).

<project name="The Virtual Medical School Project at the Hammersmith Hospital"
  url="http://www.soundray.de/vms/"
  license="GPL"
  anchorid="vms">
  Storing every imaging study digitally together with the radiologist's
  report resulted in a huge database of diseases and their imaging
  presentations as well as normal anatomy. This database is, of course,
  an immensely valuable resource for teaching. The Virtual Medical
  School Project was initiated with the intention to convert this image
  database into a knowledge base. This knowledge base will form the
  foundation of a digital network based teaching system for the whole
  of medicine at every level: the "Virtual Medical School". It is based
  heavily on free software (Apache-Cocoon).

<project name="International Classification for Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10)"

  anchorid="icm">
  There are two related classifications of diseases with similar
  titles. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the
  classification used to code and classify mortality data from death
  certificates. The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical
  Modification (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify morbidity data
  from the in-patient and out-patient records, physician offices, and
  most NCHS surveys.

  Meditux is Java-servlet based software that provides a web interface
  to MySQL. It was developed to support an intranet site in a medical
  intensive care unit where it was used to collect clinical and
  research data.
