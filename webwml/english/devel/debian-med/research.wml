  license="LGPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/python-pyepl">
 <p>
 PyEPL is a stimuli delivery and response registration toolkit to be
 used for generating psychology (as well as neuroscience, marketing
 research, and other) experiments.
 </p><p>
 It provides
 </p>
 <ul>
   <li>presentation: both visual and auditory stimuli</li>
   <li>responses registration: both manual (keyboard/joystick) and
       sound (microphone) time-stamped</li>
   <li>sync-pulsing: synchronizing your behavioral task with external
       acquisition hardware</li>
   <li>flexibility of encoding various experiments due to the use of
       Python as a description language</li>
   <li>fast execution of critical points due to the calls to linked
       compiled libraries</li>
 </ul>
 <p>
 This toolbox is here to be an alternative for a widely used
 commercial product E'(E-Prime).

<project name="phpESP"
  url="http://www.butterfat.net/wiki/Projects/phpESP/"
  license="BSD"
  deb="http://www.vanbest.org/janpascal/debian/phpesp/">
  phpESP is a package for PHP that provides an easy to use web-based
  interface to design surveys, deploy them on your web site, and
  export data. It features multiple users and user groups, with data
  isolation and hiding between groups. It is suitable for use by a
  single person, a department, or an entire organization. The surveys
  created by phpESP can be easily embedded into existing HTML templates
  with one or two new lines.

<project name="The Virtual Medical School Project at the Hammersmith Hospital"
  url="http://www.soundray.de/vms/"
  license="GPL"
  anchorid="vms">
  Storing every imaging study digitally together with the radiologist's
  report resulted in a huge database of diseases and their imaging
  presentations as well as normal anatomy. This database is, of course,
  an immensely valuable resource for teaching. The Virtual Medical
  School Project was initiated with the intention to convert this image
  database into a knowledge base. This knowledge base will form the
  foundation of a digital network based teaching system for the whole
  of medicine at every level: the "Virtual Medical School". It is based
  heavily on free software (Apache-Cocoon).

<project name="International Classification for Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10)"
  url="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd9.htm"
  license="Public Domain"
  anchorid="icm">
  There are two related classifications of diseases with similar
  titles. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the
  classification used to code and classify mortality data from death
  certificates. The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical
  Modification (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify morbidity data
  from the in-patient and out-patient records, physician offices, and
  most NCHS surveys.

<project name="EpiTools"
  url="http://www.epitools.net/"
  license="GPL">
  <p>
  Freely available numerical tools and methods of epidemiology. The primary
  target audience is public health epidemiologists and data analysts.
  Using R, an open source programming language and environment for
  statistical computing and graphics, there are provided numerial tools
  and programming solutions that have been used and tested in real-world
  epidemiologic applications.
  </p><p>
  Many practical problems in the analysis of public health data require
  programming or special software, and investigators in different locations
  may duplicate programming efforts done elsewhere. Often, simple analyses,
  such as the construction of confidence intervals, are not calculated and
  thereby complicate appropriate statistical inferences for small geographic
  areas. There are many examples of simple and useful numerical tools that
  would enhance the work of epidemiologists at local health departments and
  yet are not readily available for the problem in front of them (e.g., exact
  confidence intervals for low incidence rates, statistical pooling methods
  for meta-analysis, lifetime risk calculations, etc.). The availability of
  these tools will encourage wider use of appropriate methods and promote
  evidence-based public health practices.

<project name="Surveillance"
  url="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~hoehle/software/surveillance/"
  license="GPL">
  The intention of the R-package surveillance is to provide a test-bench
  for surveillance algorithms. It allows users to test new algorithms and
  compare their results with those of standard surveillance methods. Among
  others the package contains an implementation of the procedures described
  by Stroup et al. (1989), Farrington et al. (1996) and the system used at
  the <a href="http://www.rki.de">Robert Koch Institute (RKI)</a>, Germany.
  For evaluation purposes, the package contains example datasets drawn from the 
  <a href="http://www3.rki.de/SurvStat/">SurvStat@RKI Database maintained
  by the RKI</a>, Germany. More comprehensive comparisons using simulation
  studies are possible by methods for simulating point source outbreak data
  using a hidden Markov model. To compare the algorithms, benchmark numbers
  like sensitivity, specificity and detection delay can be computed for
  entire sets of surveillance time series.
