<h2>Clinical Research</h2>

<h3><a href="http://ovnibus.free.fr/">Ovnibus</a></h3>

<p>
 Ovnibus is a XML based project using DocBook-XML  for clinical and research
 (evidence based medicine) purposes. There is a new medical classification
 and an universal personal identifying code.

<h3><a href="http://www.soundray.de/vms/">The Virtual Medical School Project at the Hammersmith Hospital</a></h3>

<p>
 Storing every imaging study digitally together with the radiologist's
 report resulted in a huge database of diseases and their imaging
 presentations as well as normal anatomy. This database is, of course,
 an immensely valuable resource for teaching. The Virtual Medical
 School Project was initiated with the intention to convert this image
 database into a knowledge base. This knowledge base will form the
 foundation of a digital network based teaching system for the whole
 of medicine at every level: the "Virtual Medical School". It is based
 heavily on free software (Apache-Cocoon).

<h3><a href="http://www.sanchez-gtm.com/">Sanchez GT.M M/Mumps platform</a></h3>

<p>
 GT.M[tm] is a vetted, industrial strength, transaction processing
 application platform consisting of a database engine optimized for
 high TP throughput and a compiler for the M (aka MUMPS) programming
 language.

<h3><a href="http://www.hardhats.org/">DHCP / VISTA</a></h3>

<p>
 This is almost certainly the largest collection of open source
 health care software worldwide. The DHCP (Decentralized Hospital
 Computer Program) project was started in 1982 by the U.S. Department
 of Veterans Affairs. As of 1994, the VA operated 173 medical centers,
 389 outpatient clinics, 131 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries. In
 1995, DHCP was nominated for the Smithsonian award for best use of
 information technology. Because this software was developed by and
 for the U.S. Government, the source code is largely in the public
 domain. Several dozen other institutions have implemented systems
 based on the VA source code. There is an <a
 href="www.hardhats.org">active developer community</a> working on
 expanding and supporting this codebase now known as VISTA.

<h3><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/icd9.htm">International Classification for Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10)</a></h3>

<p>
 There are two related classifications of diseases with similar
 titles. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the
 classification used to code and classify mortality data from death
 certificates. The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical
 Modification (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify morbidity data
 from the inpatient and outpatient records, physician offices, and
 most NCHS surveys.

<h3><a href="http://meditux.sourceforge.net/ ">Meditux</a></h3>

<p>  
 Meditux is Java-servlet based software that provides a web interface
 to MySQL. It was developed to support an intranet site in a medical
 intensive care unit where it was used to collect clinical and
 research data.

<h3><a
href="http://www.rad.unipd.it/progetti/raynux/rayUK.php3">Raynux:
OpenSource and Radiology</a></h3>

<p>
 The project goal is to realize a wide radiologic software laboratory
 which is completely free and Opensource, without any commercial
 limitation. Everyone can participate as user, tester or developer;
 you can register yourself in the Register Section. You can find at
 now a RIS software (ESO) and image & report distribution software
 that are developed at The University of Padova, Dept. of Medical &amp;
 Diagnostic Sciences and Special Therapies.

<h3><a href="http://ipath.sourceforge.net/">iPath open source
telepathology system</a></h3>

<p>
 This project was initiated by the Department of Pathology, University
 of Basel with the aim of developing a modular and open framework for
 many telepathology applications. The project includes a telepathology
 database for case discussion and second opinion consultations and a
 telemicroscopy module for real time microscope sharing over internet.
