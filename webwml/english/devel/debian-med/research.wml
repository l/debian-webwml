Hammersmith Hospital</a></h3>

<p>
 Storing every imaging study digitally together with the radiologist's
 report resulted in a huge database of diseases and their imaging
 presentations as well as normal anatomy. This database is, of course,
 an immensely valuable resource for teaching. The Virtual Medical
 School Project was initiated with the intention to convert this image
 database into a knowledge base. This knowledge base will form the
 foundation of a digital network based teaching system for the whole
 of medicine at every level: the "Virtual Medical School". It is based
 heavily on free software (Apache-Cocoon).

Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10)</a></h3>

<p>
 There are two related classifications of diseases with similar
 titles. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD) is the
 classification used to code and classify mortality data from death
 certificates. The International Classification of Diseases, Clinical
 Modification (ICD-CM) is used to code and classify morbidity data
 from the in-patient and out-patient records, physician offices, and
 most NCHS surveys.
