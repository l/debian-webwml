 or 1000s of contigs from a shotgun sequencing project with ease, and
 will align them to another set of contigs or a genome using the NUCmer
 program included with the system. If the species are too divergent for

  TeX/LaTeX which can process multiple sequence alignments in the .MSF
  and the .ALN file format. It provides in addition to common shading
  algorithms special shading modes featuring functional aspects,
  e.g. charge or hydropathy, and a plenitude of commands for handling
  shading colors, text styles, labels, legends and even allows the user
  to define completely new shading modes. TeXshade combines highest
  flexibility and the habitual TeX output quality with reasonable time
  expenditure.

  The package is part of the texlive-latex-extra package.

  TREE-PUZZLE (the new name for PUZZLE) is an interactive console program
  that implements a fast tree search algorithm, quartet puzzling, that
  allows analysis of large data sets and automatically assigns estimations
  of support to each internal branch. TREE-PUZZLE also computes pairwise
  maximum likelihood distances as well as branch lengths for user specified
  trees. Branch lengths can also be calculated under the clock-assumption.
  In addition, TREE-PUZZLE offers a novel method, likelihood mapping, to
  investigate the support of a hypothesized internal branch without
  computing an overall tree and to visualize the phylogenetic content of a
  sequence alignment.

<project name="Wise2"
  url="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Wise2/"
  license="GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/wise">
  Wise2 is a package focused on comparisons of biopolymers, commonly DNA and
  protein sequences. There are many other packages which do this, probably the
  best known being BLAST package (from NCBI) and the Fasta package (from Bill
  Pearson). There are other packages, such as the HMMER package (Sean Eddy) or
  SAM package (UC Santa Cruz) focused on hidden Markov models (HMMs) of
  biopolymers.

  Wise2's particular forte is the comparison of DNA sequence at the level of
  its protein translation. This comparison allows the simultaneous prediction of
  say gene structure with homology based alignment. There is currently no other
  package that I know of that contains this type of algorithm with a full blown
  gene prediction model and a hidden Markov model of a protein domain.

  Wise2 also contains other algorithms, such as the venerable Smith-Waterman
  algorithm, or more modern ones such as Stephen Altschul's generalised gap
  penalties, or even experimental ones developed in house, such as dba. The
  development of these algorithms is due to the ease of developing such
  algorithms in the enviroment used by Wise2.

  Wise2 has also been written with an eye for reuse and maintainability.
  Although it is a pure C package you can access its functionality directly in
  Perl. Parts of the package (or the entire package) can be used by other C or
  C++ programs without namespace clashes as all externally linked variables have
  the unique identifier Wise2 prepended. Java and CORBA ports are being
  considered - see the API section

  Finally Wise2, although implemented in C makes heavy use of the Dynamite code
  generating language. Dynamite was written for this project, by Ewan Birney.
  There is a separate documentation for Dynamite found at
  http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Dynamite.
