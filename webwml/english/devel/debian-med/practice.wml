<h3><a href="http://www.gnumed.org/">GnuMed</a></h3>

<p>
 GNUMed is a comprehensive and robust open source software package for
 paperless medical practice.
</p>
<p>
 There will be ITPs for GnuMed and its tools soon from <a
 href="mailto:tille@debian.org">Andreas Tille</a>.  GnuMed will be a major
 part of Debian-Med.

<h3><a href="http://www.freepm.org/">FreePM</a></h3>
    
<p>     
 FreePM is a template driven system that utilizes flexible open-source
 software to provide physicians with an easy to use, easy to modify
 medical record management solution. The system consists of a series
 of templates that create the component parts of a patient's medical
 records. These templates can be tailored by the practitioner to best
 suit their individual operating environment.
</p>
<p>
 FreePM is an open source physicians office management &amp; electronic
 medical record application.  This is a <a
 href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a> based project and there are
 reference implementations.  The authors asked for integrating FreePm
 into Debian Med.

<h3><a href="http://www.freemed.org/">FreeMed</a></h3>

<p>
 Electronic Medical Record and Practice Management system for medical
 providers that runs in any web browser in multiple languages.
</p>
<p>
 FreeMed is similar to FreePM but PHP/MySQL based.
</p>
<p>
 I personally prefer GnuMed because it uses PostgreSQL and has a clear
 Client/Server structure but perhaps FreeMed could be turned into a
 nice web client to GnuMed.

<h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/openpmtoolworks">Open PM ToolWorks</a></h3>

<p> 
 This project is dedicated to developing medical group practice
 management calculators and tools that would be of interest to medical
 practice administrators.

<h3><a href="http://www.psnw.com/~alcald/#informatics">Tk Family Practice</a></h3>

<p>
 A clinical medical information system suitable for a Family
 Physicians office for storing clinical information on patients as
 opposed to just billing information. It runs on both Linux/X-windows
 and Windows 95. This is possible using Tcl/Tk as the programming
 language.

<h2>Outpatient Care</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.txoutcome.org/">OIO - Open Infrastructure for Outcomes</a></h3>

<p>
 A shared and free infrastructure that supports the pooling of
 expertise, assessment instruments, data management, training, quality
 assurance, and reporting tools is a way to reduce the cost of
 conducting outcome assessments.
</p>
<p>
 It facilitates the creation of flexible and portable patient/research
 records. It aims to achieve the "Holy Grail" of data portability as
 elegantly described by John G. Faughnan.
</p>
<p>
 It is based on <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a>.

<h3><a href="http://www.sqlclinic.net">SQL Clinic</a></h3>

<p>
 A web interface to PostgreSQL written in Perl. This is a complete
 clinical and administrative application for providers of psychiatric
 housing, although the software is designed to accomodate an entire
 Community Mental Health Care Center (CMHC) or private practitioners
 (both Clinical Social Workers and Psychiatrists) working in
 Behavioural Health. Technical support is free via mailing
 lists. Support contracts are available from Saint Vincent Catholic
 Medical Centers of New York.

<h3><a href="http://www.openhealth.com/circare/">Circare</a></h3>

<p>
 Circare is a client and provider index that ties together the
 information about a single patient and makes it available securely to
 care providers in a distributed network. The goal of this project is
 to be the "home page" for finding patient information distributed in
 numerous locations around a regional network.
