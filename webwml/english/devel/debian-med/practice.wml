href="http://www.gnumed.org/">GnuMed</a></h3>

<p>
 GNUMed is a comprehensive and robust Open Source software package for
 paper-less medical practice.
</p>
<p>
 There will be ITPs for GnuMed and its tools soon from <a
 href="mailto:tille@debian.org">Andreas Tille</a>.  GnuMed will be a major
 part of Debian-Med.

<h3><a id="freepm" name="freepm"
href="http://www.freepm.org/">FreePM</a></h3>

<p>
 FreePM is a template driven system that utilizes flexible open-source
 software to provide physicians with an easy to use, easy to modify
 medical record management solution. The system consists of a series
 of templates that create the component parts of a patient's medical
 records. These templates can be tailored by the practitioner to best
 suit their individual operating environment.
</p>
<p>
 FreePM is an Open Source physicians office management &amp; electronic
 medical record application.  This is a <a
 href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a> based project and there are
 reference implementations.  The authors asked for integrating FreePm
 into Debian-Med.

<h3><a id="freemed" name="freemed"
href="http://www.freemed.org/">FreeMed</a></h3>

<p>
 Electronic medical record and practice management system for medical
 providers that runs in any web browser in multiple languages.
</p>
<p>
 FreeMed is similar to FreePM but PHP/MySQL based.
</p>
<p>
 I personally prefer GnuMed because it uses PostgreSQL and has a clear
 client/server structure but perhaps FreeMed could be turned into a
 nice web client to GnuMed.

<h2>Out-patient Care</h2>

<h3><a id="OIO" name="OIO"
href="http://www.txoutcome.org/">OIO - Open Infrastructure for Outcomes</a></h3>

<p>
 A shared and free infrastructure that supports the pooling of
 expertise, assessment instruments, data management, training, quality
 assurance, and reporting tools is a way to reduce the cost of
 conducting outcome assessments.
</p>
<p>
 It facilitates the creation of flexible and portable patient/research
 records. It aims to achieve the "Holy Grail" of data portability as
 elegantly described by John G. Faughnan.
</p>
<p>
 It is based on <a href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a>.

 housing, although the software is designed to accommodate an entire

 lists. Support contracts are available from Saint Vincent Catholic

 Circare is a client and provider index that ties together the

 to be the "home page" for finding patient information distributed in
 numerous locations around a regional network.
