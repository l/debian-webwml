<h3><a id="torch" name="torch"
href="http://www.openparadigms.com/">Torch</a></h3>

<p>
 Torch (formerly known as FreePM) is a template driven system that utilizes flexible open-source
 software to provide physicians with an easy to use, easy to modify
 medical record management solution. The system consists of a series
 of templates that create the component parts of a patient's medical
 records. These templates can be tailored by the practitioner to best
 suit their individual operating environment.
</p>
<p>
 Torch is an Open Source physicians office management &amp; electronic
 medical record application.  This is a <a
 href="http://www.zope.org">Zope</a> based project and there are
 reference implementations.  The authors asked for integrating Torch
 into Debian-Med.

<h3><a id="freemed" name="freemed"
href="http://www.freemed.org/">FreeMed</a></h3>

<p>
 Electronic medical record and practice management system for medical
 providers that runs in any web browser in multiple languages.
</p>
<p>
 FreeMed is similar to FreePM but PHP/MySQL based.
</p>
<p>
 I personally prefer GnuMed because it uses PostgreSQL and has a clear
 client/server structure but perhaps FreeMed could be turned into a
 nice web client to GnuMed.
