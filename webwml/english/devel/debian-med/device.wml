<h3><a href="http://gasnet.med.yale.edu/lamdi/">LAMDI - Linux
Anesthesia Modular Devices Interface</a></h3>

<p>
 The basic idea behind the LAMDI project is to develop a modular
 interface between various anesthesia devices. Devices in this context
 could be: data capture devices, Software interpretation devices like
 pharmacokinetic or hemodynamic modeling modules; control devices
 like infusion pumps and simulation devices.

<p>
 DICOMScope is a free DICOM viewer which can display uncompressed,
 monochrome DICOM images of all modalities and supports a calibration
 of the monitor according to DICOM part 14 as well as the new
 Presentation States. DICOMScope offers a print client (DICOM Basic
 Grayscale Print Management) which also implements the optional
 Presentation LUT SOP Class. The development of this prototype was
 commissioned by the "Committee for the Advancement of DICOM".
