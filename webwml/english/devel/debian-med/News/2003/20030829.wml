<p>
The term "news" is not really appropriate for this summary of the
activities around the Debian-Med project. However, this is an overview
about the last half year.<br />
<a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/index.html">All
preformated slides and MagicPoint sources</a> of the talks mentioned
below are avilable online.
</p>

<h2>Talks at <a
href="http://www.tu-chemnitz.de/linux/tag/lt5/">LinuxTag Chemnitz</a></h2>

<p>
Andreas Tille had two talk at LinuxTag at 2. March in Chemnitz
about <a href="../../talks/internal/">Debian Internal
Projects</a> and <a href="../../talks/med/">Debian-Med</a>.  The
interest in both talks was great and the subsequent discussion very
prolific.
</p>

<h2>Talk at <a
href="http://egovos.org/">EGovOS conference</a></h2>
<p>
At 18. March the power of Debian-Med network was proven: Andreas Tille
was not able to take part in the <a
href="http://egovos.org/march-2003/agenda.html">EGovOS conference</a>
in Washington DC and thus Aaron Ucko held the talk about Debian-Med in
place of Andreas.
</p>

<h2>Talk at <a
href="http://libresoftwaremeeting.org/">Libre Software Meeting</a></h2>
<p>
The idea of Debian-Med was born in 2001 at the <a
href="http://lsm.abul.org/">Libre Software Meeting</a> in 
Bordeaux.  This year this event took place in <a
href="http://libresoftwaremeeting.org/program/view_topic.php?topic_id=14">Metz</a>.
At 9. Juli Andreas Tille reported about the progress of the project in
the last two years.
</p>

<h2>Talk at <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2003/">LinuxTag Karlsruhe</a></h2>
<p>
Two days later, at 11. July, Andreas Tille held a talk at <a
href="http://www.linuxtag.org/2003/de/conferences/program-11.07.2003.html">The
Free Conference at LinuxTag in Karlsruhe</a>.
This talk was visited by more than 100 interested people.  The
subsequent discussion showed, that physicians as well as computer
engineers could be addressed.
</p>

<h2>Paper about Debian-Med</a>
<p>
By now exists a <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/paper/debian-med.html">paper
about Debian-Med</a> covering the topics of the current talk more detailed.
The <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/paper/">SGML
source as well as a Makefile for creation of different formats/a> is
also available.
</p>

<h2>Experimental GnuMed packages and Knoppix</h2>
<p>
Andreas Tille had started to build <a
href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/packages/gnumed">experimental
packages of GnuMed</a>.  Currently no Packages file is provided which
disables easy installation via apt-get.  This is intentional because
the packages are not yet ready for common use.  The reason for
providing the packages as they are is to demonstrate how they might
look in the future and how the single tools of the GnuMed suite will
be split up between the packages.
</p>
<p>
Moreover these packages support the work of Sebastian Hilbert
who builded a <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix">Knoppix</a> based
<a href="http://marvin.ba-loerrach.de/gnumed.iso">live CD with GnuMed</a>.
</p>

<h2>Debian Conference 3 in Oslo</h2>
<p>
During the Debian conference a group of developers agreed to rename "Debian Internal
Projects" to "Customized Debian Distributions".  This makes more
explicit clear that these projects aim to customize Debian for special
user interests.
