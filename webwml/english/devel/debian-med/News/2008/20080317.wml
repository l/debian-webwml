<p>
The Debian project has been accepted as a mentor organisation for the <a
href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008">Google Summer of Code 2008</a>, and two
of the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2008">proposed projects</a>
are relevant to the field of bioinformatics. 
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2008/biodata">\
       Biological databases manager</a> project, it is proposed to students to
       build an application to automate the downloading, upgrading and indexing
       of databases such as GenBank, miRbase, Jaspar, REbase,... The database 
       manager will take advantage of the bioinformatics programs packaged in 
       Debian.</p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <p>In the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2008/cran2deb">\
       cran2deb</a> project, it is proposed to students to generate Debian 
       packages for <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">GNU R</a> from package
       sources. This project would allow the <a 
       href="http://www.bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a> R packages to be 
       distributed in the Debian format.</p>
  </li>
</ul>


<p>Debian Med will provide mentorship for the <em>Biological databases 
   manager</em> project, and Dirk Eddelbuettel is the mentor of the 
   <em>cran2deb</em> project. Debian Med encourages students to apply to one 
   or the other project.</p>
