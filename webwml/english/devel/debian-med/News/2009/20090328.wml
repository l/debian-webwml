The Debian project has been accepted as a <a
href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/show/google/gsoc2009/debian" mentor
organisation</a> for the <a href="http://code.google.com/">Google Summer of
Code</a> 2009, and two of the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2009">proposed projects</a> are directly
related Debian Med:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2009/DataPackages">Large dataset
manager</a> consists in building an application to automate the
downloading, upgrading and indexing of large datasets, such as genomes, gene
models, and other curated datasets in the case of bioinformatics. The large
dataset manager will be especially useful in conjunction with programs already
packaged in Debian that are capable to index datasets, such as <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/emboss">EMBOSS</a> or <a
href="http://packages.debian.org/blast2">NCBI Blast</a>.
</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p>

The <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2009/Blends_Webtools">Blends
Webtools</a> consists in enhancing the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends">Debian Pure Blends</a> webtools
by using the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase">Ultimate
Debian Database</a>. The Debian Pure Blends is the framework used by the Debian
Med to produce its thematic meta-packages and monitor all packages related to
biology and medicine in Debian, and the Ultimate Debian Database is a novel
convergence point of information for Debian, developed during last year's
Google Summer of Code.

</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>
The other projects proposed by Debian this year are related to packaging,
the Debian installer, our bug tracking system, our infrastructure for building
binary packages, our archive, and websites.</p>
