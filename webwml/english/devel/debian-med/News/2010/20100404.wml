The Debian project has been accepted as a <a
href="http://socghop.appspot.com/org/show/google/gsoc2010/debian">mentor
organisation</a> for the <a href="http://socghop.appspot.com/">Google Summer of
Code 2010</a>, and three of the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/Applying">proposed projects</a>
are directly related Debian Med:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>
The <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/LargeDataPackages">Large dataset
manager</a> consists in building an application to automate the
downloading, upgrading and indexing of large datasets, such as genomes, gene
models, and other curated datasets in the case of bioinformatics. The large
dataset manager will be especially useful in conjunction with programs already
packaged in Debian that are capable to index datasets, such as <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/emboss">EMBOSS</a> or <a
href="https://packages.debian.org/blast2">NCBI Blast</a>.
</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p>
The <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/BlendsUtilities">Blends
Utilities</a> project consists in enhancing the <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPureBlends">Debian Pure Blends</a>
by using the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/UltimateDebianDatabase">Ultimate
Debian Database</a>. The Debian Pure Blends is the framework used by the Debian
Med to produce its thematic meta-packages and monitor all packages related to
biology and medicine in Debian, and the Ultimate Debian Database, a
convergence point of information for Debian, developed during the
Google Summer of Code 2008.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
The <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/HighPerformanceComputing">high
performance computing</a> project consists in enhancing support for batch processing in a Debian <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/Cloud">cloud</a> environment.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The other projects proposed by Debian this year are related to our
packaging system, installer, bug tracking system, infrastructure for building
binary packages, archive, and websites.</p>

<p>Of course, do not hesitate to <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2010/Applying">apply</a> with your own
project, we warmly welcome new ideas.</p>
