<p>A new build system for meta packages is currently under development
and thus the latest med-* packages are available in the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/experimental/">experimental
distribution</a> until sarge is released. This is to avoid having not
carefully tested packages in the stable distribution.</p>

<p>The effect for the user is probably quite low, but the build system
will be drastically enhanced with regard to the building of user menus.
Moreover, support for tasksel will be included.</p>
