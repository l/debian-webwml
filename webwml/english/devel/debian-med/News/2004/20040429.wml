<h2>Co-maintainer for the Debian Med webpages</h2>

<p>
 After Andreas Tille encouraged people to get involved in the Debian Med
 Project by pointing out
 <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2004/debian-med-200403/msg00001.html">
 areas which need help</a>, Tobias Toedter volunteered to support him
 with regard to the webpages. Andreas now has more time to take care of
 the packaging work for Debian Med.
</p>
<p>
 Currently, the webpages are undergoing a thorough revision, with links
 being checked, new programs added, and expired projects removed. If
 you spot any errors or missing programs, please feel free to send an e-mail
 to the designated
 <a href="mailto:debian-med@lists.debian.org">Debian Med mailing list</a>.
 Everybody who is interested and can spare some time is invited to
 join the Debian Med web team.
</p>
