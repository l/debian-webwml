<p>
 Two new med-packages reached Incoming on ftp-master and will be available soon.
 They are provide by <a href="mailto:tille@debian.org">Andreas Tille</a> in the
 hope that they will be carefully tested while he has vacations from 06/28 to
 07/22/2002 to continue working on it after this time.  He is hoping for
 opinions, suggestions, bug reports (prefferably with fixes :-) ).

<h2>med-common - Debian Med Project common package</h2>
<p>
 This package builds the basic infrastructure of all med-* packages.
</p>
<p>
 It provides some files which are common to all med-* packages thus all
 med-* meta packages should depend on it.  There where updated versions
 of all med-* packages on the way but they are delayed to let med-common
 make its way first into the archive.
</p>
<p>
 The main purpose is to introduce a method to handle system users in a group
 <tt>med</tt> using <tt>debconf</tt>.  The debconf stuff and the tools used
 are written with the intention that they can easily adopted by other
 Debian Internal Projects like 
 <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian-Junior</a>.
 In fact it could possibly make sense to build a package
 <tt>internal-project-common</tt> which could contain most of the
 stuff which is currently in <tt>med-common</tt>.  We should find a
 general solution here.
</p>
<p class="mark">
 Please test this package carefully.  Read the file 
 <tt>/usr/share/doc/med-common/BUGS</tt> and try to find out more
 bugs or just fix some of them.
</p>

<h2>med-common-dev - Debian Med Project common development package</h2>
<p>
 Practice has shown that each med-* metapackage has more or less a
 common set of files and a common set of commands in debian/rules.
 So why not providing a set of templates for the ease of further
 development of med-* meta packages and a script which can be used
 in debian/rules and do the necessary stuff there.
