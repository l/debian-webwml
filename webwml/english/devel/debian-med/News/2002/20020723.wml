<h2>Debian Med article in <a
href="http://www.gnu.org/brave-gnu-world/issue-41.en.html">Brave GNU
World - Issue #41</a></h2>
<p>
 We are hoping that our project now will get a wider audience when
 people reading this <a
 href="http://www.gnu.org/brave-gnu-world/issue-41.en.html">Brave GNU
 World issue</a> and more people will join our project to take over
 certain tasks.
</p>

<h2>Menu system</h2>
<p>
 Some testing went over the new user menu system and showed some minor
 problems which will be solved soon. We have to observe the new
 general menu mechanism closely which is currently discussed at the
 Debian development mailing list.
