<p>Over the last weekend of January the first <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed/Meeting/Luebeck2011">Debian Sprint on
Bioinformatics</a> is taking place in L&uuml;beck-Travenm&uuml;nde, Germany.  This brings
a series of developers from upstream, Debian, its derivatives and their users
(scientists) together. For two intensive days they expect to find ways for
better avoidance of redundancies in their daily work, the packaging and further
develop ideas to extend the outreach of the distributions into the field. The
effort shall yield an improved transfer of skills between groups and, just as
Debian at large, help students and hobbyists of all ages to gain insights and
contribute to scientific developments.</p>
