<p>Andreas Tille <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2005/06/msg00024.html">
announced</a> that there will be a Debian-Med day at this year's DebConf.
Everyone interested in the Debian-Med project is invited to join the
meeting. Unfortunately, it wasn't possible to specify the date and
time of the meeting yet. Andreas will post this information as soon
as it is available.</p>

<p>During the meeting, some of the covered topics are the organization
of the Debian-Med webpages, the metapackages, the lack of upstream
software in some areas, how to encourage free software authors to
write medical software, and much more. You can read more about this
on <a href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/talks/200507_debconf5-med/debian-med-day/">
