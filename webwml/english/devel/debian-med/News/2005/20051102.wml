<p>Andreas Tille <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/2005/11/msg00002.html">
announced</a> that the gnumed-client packages entered testing (Etch)
last week. You have to use the public server or install the server
from CVS at your own, because the server packages are not yet ready.
Still, it's an important step towards a medical practice software
being available from Debian.</p>
