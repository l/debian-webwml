<h3><a id="Slicer" name="Slicer"
href="http://www.slicer.org">Slicer</a></h3>

<p>
 The Slicer is freely available, open-source software for
 visualization, registration, segmentation, and quantification of
 medical data built on top of <a
 href="http://public.kitware.com/vtk">VTK</a>.  Slicer can read
 industry standard CT and MR image volume file formats, including
 DICOM.  Slicer can be used to create complex 3D models, script and
 render animations, and make measurements.  Additional modules can be
 added to Slicer using C++ and Tcl.
</p>
<p>
 Please note: Slicer is a research tool only, and should not be relied
 upon for any clinical applications.
</p>
<p>
 Development of the Slicer is an ongoing collaboration between the MIT
 Artificial Intelligence Lab and the Surgical Planning Lab at Brigham
 &amp; Women's Hospital, an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. Slicer
 has an active developer community and is being used for research at
 many institutions around the world.

<h3><a id="ctsim" name="ctsim"
href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/ctsim.html">CTsim: The
Open Source Computed Tomography Simulator</a></h3>

<p>
 Computed Tomography is the technique of estimating the interior
 of objects from the measurements of radiation projected through
 the object. CTsim simulates the process of transmitting X-rays
 through phantom objects. These X-ray data are called
 projections. CTsim reconstructs the original phantom image from
 the projections using a variety of algorithms. Additionally,
 CTsim has a wide array of image analysis and image processing
 functions.

<p>
The project name stands for Medical Image Conversion. It provides a
flexible command-line utility (for batch conversion) and a neat
graphical front-end using the Gtk+ toolkit. The supported formats are:
Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), Concorde, DICOM 3.0 (incl. Siemens
"mosaic" format), Ecat/Matrix 6.4, InterFile3.3, Gif87a/89a and
raw/binary data. The library (libmdc) can be used by other programs for
im/exporting (see e.g. AMIDE) and is extendable for other formats.

<h3><a id="dcmtk" name="dcmtk"
href="http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk/">DCMTK - DICOM Toolkit</a></h3>

<p>
 DCMTK is a collection of libraries and applications implementing
 large parts the DICOM standard for medical image communication. It
 includes software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM
 image files, handling offline media, sending and receiving images
 over a network connection, as well as demonstration image storage and
 worklist servers. DCMTK is is written in a mixture of ANSI C and
 C++. The toolkit is made available as "Open Source" software.
</p>
<p>
 DCMTK has been used at numerous DICOM demonstrations to provide
 central, vendor independent, image storage and worklist servers (CTNs
 - Central Test Nodes). It is used by hospitals and companies all over
 the world for a wide variety of purposes ranging from being a tool
 for product testing to being a building block for research projects,
 prototypes and commercial products.
