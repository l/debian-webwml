<p>DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the
de-facto standard for medical image management. The standard defines
data structures and services for the exchange of medical images and
related information. The latest release has been published in 2004
and consists of 18 parts.</p>

<p>For more information, you can visit the
<a href="http://medical.nema.org/">NEMA homepage</a> or

  license="<free />"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/ctn">
  The Central Test Node (CTN) software is a DICOM implementation which
  was designed to be used at the RSNA (Radiological Society of North
  America) annual meetings to foster cooperative demonstrations by the
  medical imaging vendors. The goal was to provide a centralized
  implementation that facilitated vendor participation based on the
  evolving DICOM standard.
