<p>DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine) is the
de-facto standard for medical image management. The standard defines
data structures and services for the exchange of medical images and
related information. The latest release has been published in 2004
and consists of 18 parts.</p>

<p>For more information, you can visit the
<a href="http://medical.nema.org/">NEMA homepage</a> or
