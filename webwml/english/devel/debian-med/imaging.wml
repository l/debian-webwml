<project name="CTSim"
  url="http://www.ctsim.org/"
  license="GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/ctsim">
  Computed Tomography is the technique of estimating the interior
  of objects from the measurements of radiation projected through
  the object. CTsim simulates the process of transmitting X-rays
  through phantom objects. These X-ray data are called
  projections. CTsim reconstructs the original phantom image from
  the projections using a variety of algorithms. Additionally,
  CTsim has a wide array of image analysis and image processing
  functions.

  license="GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/paul">
  This program was originally not intended for medical purpose, but it
  contains some possibly useful algorithms to compare images and handle
  image sequences.

<project name="(X)MedCon"
  url="http://xmedcon.sourceforge.net/"
  license="(L)GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/xmedcon">
  The project name stands for Medical Image Conversion. It provides a
  flexible command-line utility (for batch conversion) and a neat
  graphical front-end using the Gtk+ toolkit. The supported formats are:
  Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), Concorde, DICOM 3.0 (incl. Siemens
  "mosaic" format), Ecat/Matrix 6.4, InterFile3.3, Gif87a/89a and
  raw/binary data. The library (libmdc) can be used by other programs for
  im/exporting (see e.g.
  <a href="#amide">AMIDE</a>) and is extendable for other formats.

<project name="DCMTK - DICOM-Toolkit"
  url="http://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en"
  license="BSD">
<p>
  DCMTK is a collection of libraries and applications implementing
  large parts the DICOM standard for medical image communication. It
  includes software for examining, constructing and converting DICOM
  image files, handling offline media, sending and receiving images
  over a network connection, as well as demonstration image storage and
  worklist servers. DCMTK is is written in a mixture of ANSI C and C++.
  The toolkit is made available as "Open Source" software.
</p>
<p>
 DCMTK has been used at numerous DICOM demonstrations to provide
 central, vendor independent, image storage and worklist servers (CTNs
 - Central Test Nodes). It is used by hospitals and companies all over
 the world for a wide variety of purposes ranging from being a tool
 for product testing to being a building block for research projects,
 prototypes and commercial products.
