<project name="CTN"
  url="http://www.erl.wustl.edu/DICOM/ctn.html"
  license="<free />"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/ctn">
  The Central Test Node (CTN) software is a DICOM implementation which
  was designed to be used at the RSNA (Radiological Society of North
  America) annual meetings to foster cooperative demonstrations by the
  medical imaging vendors. The goal was to provide a centralized
  implementation that facilitated vendor participation based on the
  evolving DICOM standard.

<project name="CTSim"
  url="http://www.ctsim.org/"
  license="GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/science/ctsim">
  <p>
    CTSim provides an interactive computed tomography simulator. Computed
    tomography is the technique of estimating the interior of an object
    by on measuring x-ray absorption through an object.
  </p>
  <p>
    It has both command-line tools as well as a graphical user interface.
    CTSim has very education trace modes for viewing the data collection
    simulation as well as the reconstruction.

<project name="Paul"
  url="http://www.physik.uni-halle.de/~e2od5/debian/paul.html"
  license="GPL"
  deb="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/graphics/paul">
  <p>
    Paul = <em>P</em>rogram zur <em>A</em>uswertung und <em>U</em>mwandlung
    von <em>L</em>aserbildern (for non German speakers: Program to evaluate
    and convert laser images). Especially designed to work with gray scaled
    image sequences but may be useful for any image. The use of imlib gives
    great flexibility of file formats and is fast.
  </p>
  <p>
    Features: move images until they match; cut images precisely; create
    clickable HTML maps; 2D-FFT; operations onto single image or set
    of images.

  anchorid="medcon">
  The project name stands for Medical Image Conversion. It provides a
  flexible command-line utility (for batch conversion) and a neat
  graphical front-end using the Gtk+ toolkit. The supported formats are:
  Acr/Nema 2.0, Analyze (SPM), Concorde, DICOM 3.0 (incl. Siemens
  "mosaic" format), Ecat/Matrix 6.4, InterFile3.3, Gif87a/89a and
  raw/binary data. The library (libmdc) can be used by other programs for
  import and export (see e.g.
  <a href="#amide">AMIDE</a>) and is extendable for other formats.
