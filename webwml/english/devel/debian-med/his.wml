<project name="VistA (DHCP)"
  url="http://www.hardhats.org/"
  license="Public Domain"
  anchorid="vista">
  This is almost certainly the largest collection of Open Source
  health care software worldwide. The DHCP (Decentralized Hospital
  Computer Program) project was started in 1982 by the U.S. Department
  of Veterans Affairs. As of 1994, the VA operated 173 medical centers,
  389 out-patient clinics, 131 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries. In
  1995, DHCP was nominated for the Smithsonian award for best use of
  information technology. Because this software was developed by and
  for the U.S. Government, the source code is largely in the public
  domain. Several dozen other institutions have implemented systems
  based on the VA source code. There is an active developer community
  working on expanding and supporting this code-base now known as VistA.
