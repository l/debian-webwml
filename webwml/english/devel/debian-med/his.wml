href="http://www.hardhats.org/">DHCP / VISTA</a></h3>

<p>
 This is almost certainly the largest collection of Open Source
 health care software worldwide. The DHCP (Decentralized Hospital
 Computer Program) project was started in 1982 by the U.S. Department
 of Veterans Affairs. As of 1994, the VA operated 173 medical centers,
 389 out-patient clinics, 131 nursing homes, and 39 domiciliaries. In
 1995, DHCP was nominated for the Smithsonian award for best use of
 information technology. Because this software was developed by and
 for the U.S. Government, the source code is largely in the public
 domain. Several dozen other institutions have implemented systems
 based on the VA source code. There is an <a
 href="www.hardhats.org">active developer community</a> working on
 expanding and supporting this code-base now known as VISTA.

Open Source and Radiology</a></h3>

<p>
 The project goal is to realize a wide radiologic software laboratory
 which is completely free and Open Source, without any commercial
 limitation. Everyone can participate as user, tester or developer;
 you can register yourself in the Register section. You can find at
 now a RIS software (ESO) and image &amp; report distribution software
 that are developed at The University of Padova, Dept. of Medical &amp;
 Diagnostic Sciences and Special Therapies.

telepathology system</a></h3>

<p>
 This project was initiated by the Department of Pathology, University
 of Basel with the aim of developing a modular and open framework for
 many telepathology applications. The project includes a telepathology
 database for case discussion and second opinion consultations and a
 telemicroscopy module for real time microscope sharing over the Internet.
