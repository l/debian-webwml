<h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/medrec/">Medical Record DTD</a></h3>

<p>
 The goal is to develop XML DTDs and software to facilitate the secure
 transfer of personal health record information from notebooks, PDAs,
 and other local databases to websites that specialize in archiving
 health record information.

<h3><a href="http://aurora.rg.iupui.edu/~gunther/#ProtoGen">ProtoGen/HL7</a></h3>

<p>
 ProtoGen/HL7 is essentially a parser/builder generator that extracts
 it's rules from the HL7 standard document. The interface to the
 parser/builder is C++. Thus, the result of the generator is a C++
 class library for the HL7 protocol. With the library you can build
 HL7 client/server applications or batch processors very easily.
</p>
<p>
 This site also contains a wealth of information about implementing
 HL7 aware open source applications and links to the most recent HL7
 modelling work.

<p>
 Open source HL7 (V2.1, 2.2) parser.

<h3><a href="http://hl7lib.sourceforge.net/">HL7Lib</a></h3>

<p>
 This is an attempt to produce a simple, correct HL7 library that can
 be embedded in projects to enable rapid development of powerful tools
 and robust interfaces. I intend to provide the same interface in C,
 Perl and Tcl. If someone else cares to implement the same library in
 another language (python perhaps) I will add a contrib section to
 this package and happily include it as well.

<h3><a href="http://www.gehr.org/">GEHR -- Good Electronic Health Record</a></h3>

<p>
 The Good Electronic Health Record (GEHR), a major part of the work of
 the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving electronic health record
 architecture designed to be comprehensive, portable and
 medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the Good European
 Health Record project requirements statement and object model.

Medical Record Project</a></h3>

<p>
 This work involves the design and implementation of decentralized,
 web based medical record systems. Current application packages:
 <ol>
  <li>A prototype patient record system,</li>
  <li>A hierarchical medical record browser,</li>
  <li>A relational data base medical record browser,</li>
  <li>A patient data collection instrument.</li>
 </ol>
 The applications packages are written in an enhanced dialect of the
 Mumps language which includes support for web server development and
 SQL server storage of the data.
