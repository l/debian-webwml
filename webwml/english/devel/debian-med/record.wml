<project name="Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage"
  url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/febrl/"
  license="MPL 1.1"
  anchorid="febrl">
  <p>
    Febrl (Freely Extensible Biomedical Record Linkage) does data
    standardisation (segmentation and cleaning) and probabilistic record
    linkage ("fuzzy" matching) of one or more files or data sources which
    do not share a unique record key or identifier.

<project name="HL7Browser"
  url="http://nule.org/software/hl7utils/browser.html"
  license="GPL">
  The HL7 Browser is a tool that allows health care professionals to
  simplify the analysis and editing of HL7 records. Its main features are
  a tree-based message browser, a table-based reporting utility, and a
  TCP/IP MLLP network tool for sending and receiving messages over the
  network.

<project name="HL7ImExa"
  url="ftp://ftp.erl.wustl.edu/pub/hl7imexa/">
  Open Source HL7 (V2.1, 2.2) parser.
</project>


<project name="HL7Lib"
  url="http://hl7lib.sourceforge.net/"
  license="GPL">
  This is an attempt to produce a simple, correct HL7 library that can
  be embedded in projects to enable rapid development of powerful tools
  and robust interfaces. The author intends to provide the same interface
  in C, Perl, and Tcl. If someone else cares to implement the same library
  in another language (Python perhaps) he will add a contrib section to
  this package and happily include it as well.
</project>


<project name="Medical Records"
  url="http://sourceforge.net/projects/medrec/"
  anchorid="medrec">
  Medical Records is an initial and premature personal software for
  physicians, who want to keep their patients' data for
  research/review purposes. From its simple features, shows that the
  aim of this application is its information and simplicity.
</project>


<project name="Mirth Project"
  url="http://www.mirthproject.org/"
  license="MPL 1.1">
  The goal of the Mirth Project is to develop an open source
  cross-platform HL7 interface engine that enables bi-directional
  sending of HL7 messages between systems and applications over
  multiple transports. By utilizing an enterprise service bus
  framework and a channel-based architecture, Mirth allows messages
  to be filtered, transformed, and routed based on user-defined rules.

<project name="OpenEHR - Open Electronic Health Record"
  url="http://www.openehr.org/"
  license="MPL"
  anchorid="openehr">
  The Open Electronic Health Record (OpenEHR), a major part of the work of
  the openEHR Foundation, is an evolving electronic health record
  architecture designed to be comprehensive, portable and
  medico-legally robust. It has been developed from the Good European
  Health Record project requirements statement and object model.

<project name="ProtoGen/HL7"
  url="http://aurora.rg.iupui.edu/~gunther/#ProtoGen"
  license="GPL">
  <p>
    ProtoGen/HL7 is essentially a parser/builder generator that extracts
    it's rules from the HL7 standard document. The interface to the
    parser/builder is C++. Thus, the result of the generator is a C++
    class library for the HL7 protocol. With the library you can build
    HL7 client/server applications or batch processors very easily.
  </p>
  <p>
    This site also contains a wealth of information about implementing
    HL7 aware Open Source applications and links to the most recent HL7
    modeling work.
