<p>
 Gnotary is an e-mail service to help prove that medical (and other)
 records have not been modified after a certain date. As opposed to
 handwriting and chemical changes of ink and paper over time, digital
 records can be altered without leaving a trace, even serial backups
 on CD-ROMS can be made retrospectively, so it might have little value
 in court. You simply email a message to any gnotary server, and
 pronto - an email comes back with a digital signature certifying that
 your email has been received at a given date. If you alter the
 content of the original email, the verification of the signature does
 not work any more.

<p>
 Electrocardiognosis (short: ECGNOSIS) is an ambulatory 24h ECG monitor,
 that is a device about the size of a dictaphone which a patient carries
 with him for a day and which records an electrocardiogram, continuously,
 for this period. The electrocardiogram is stored in RAM memory and can be
 later transfered to a Linux computer where it can be processed using the
 Electrocardiognosis analysis program. This kind of device is also called
 &quot;a holter monitor&quot; after the name of its inventor, Norman Holter.
