  <p>
    Mencal is a menstruation calendar written in Perl.

    It is a simple variation of the well-known Unix command cal. The main
    difference is that you can have some periodically repeating days
    highlighted in color. This can be used to track menstruation (or other)
    cycles conveniently.

<project name="Electrocardiognosis"
  url="http://ecgnosis.corlan.net/"
  license="GPL">
  Electrocardiognosis (short: ECGNOSIS) is an ambulatory 24h ECG monitor,
  that is a device about the size of a dictaphone which a patient carries
  with them for a day and which records an electrocardiogram, continuously,
  for this period. The electrocardiogram is stored in RAM memory and can be
  later transfered to a Linux computer where it can be processed using the
  Electrocardiognosis analysis program. This kind of device is also called
  a "holter monitor" after the name of its inventor, Norman Holter.

<project name="Gnotary"
  url="http://www.gnumed.net/gnotary/"
  license="GPL">
  Gnotary is an e-mail service to help prove that medical (and other)
  records have not been modified after a certain date. As opposed to
  handwriting and chemical changes of ink and paper over time, digital
  records can be altered without leaving a trace, even serial backups
  on CD-ROMS can be made retrospectively, so it might have little value
  in court. You simply email a message to any gnotary server, and
  pronto - an email comes back with a digital signature certifying that
  your email has been received at a given date. If you alter the
  content of the original email, the verification of the signature does
  not work any more.
