<h3><a id="cosmos" name="cosmos"
href="http://cosmos.sourceforge.net/">COSMOS: Common Open Source Medical Objects</a></h3>

<p>
 The main purpose of COSMOS is to serve as a repository of reusable
 objects (in source code) that are relevant to the medical
 domain. Small applications with increasing functionality, will then
 be built on top of the objects.

<h3><a id="gnotary" name="gnotary"
href="http://www.gnumed.net/gnotary">Gnotary</a></h3>

<p>
 Gnotary is an e-mail service to help prove that medical (and other)
 records have not been modified after a certain date. As opposed to
 handwriting and chemical changes of ink and paper over time, digital
 records can be altered without leaving a trace, even serial backups
 on CD-ROMS can be made retrospectively, so it might have little value
 in court. You simply email a message to any gnotary server, and
 pronto - an email comes back with a digital signature certifying that
 your email has been received at a given date. If you alter the
 content of the original email, the verification of the signature does
 not work any more.
