What is Debian?

%pause
&a Linux is just the kernel of your operating system.

%pause
&a You need a lot of applications around.

%pause
&a Those collections of software around the Linux kernel is called distribution.

%pause
&a Companies who build such distributions are called distributors.

%pause
&a They make money by selling their distribution in boxes, doing support and training.

%pause
&a You might know Mandrake, Red Hat, Suse and others.

%pause
&a Debian is just one of them.

What is Debian? (next try)


The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made \
common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system \
that we have created is called \

%center
Debian GNU/Linux,

%leftfill
or simply Debian for short.

Moreover, work is in progress to provide Debian for other than Linux \
kernels, primarily for the Hurd.  Other possible kernels are BSD and \
even ports to MS Windows are planed.

Differences to other distributions

&A Debian is no company but an organisation.
%pause
&A It does not sell anything.
%pause
&A Debian members (maintainers) are volunteers.
%pause
&A Maintainers are working on the common goal: building the best operating \
   system they could afford
%pause
&A Largest collection of ready-to-install Free Software on the Internet
%pause
&a Two ways to obtain Debian GNU/Linux
%pause
&b   Buying it from any 
%cont
%font "it"
 other
%cont 
%font "standard"
 distributor on CD
%pause
&B   Downloading from the Web for free
%pause
&A The later is the common way and there are really great tools to do it this way.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

What are Debian internal projects?
%font "standard"
%pause
&A Debian contains nearly 10000 binary packages
%pause
&A General users interested in a subset of those packages
%pause
&A Care for special groups of target users with different skills and interests
%pause
&A Not only handy collections of program packages but care for \
   easy installation and configuration for the intended purpose.
%pause
%font "bi"
&A No fork 
%cont
%font "standard"
from Debian
%pause
&goal Basic idea: Do not make a separate distribution but make Debian fit for \
      special purpose instead

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

Motivation


&A Profile of target users:
%pause
&B   Less technical competence
%pause
&B   Not able to install upstream programs with acceptable effort
%pause
&B   No interest in administration
%pause
&B   Interest in defined subset of available free software
%pause
&B   Need for easy usage
%pause
&B   Defined security profile

%pause
&A Other possible projects:
%pause
&B    Authorities
%pause
&B    Office
%pause
&B    Enterprise / accounting
%pause
&B    ???

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

Status of specialized free software

&A Hard to install
%pause
&A Hard to maintain
%pause
&A Hard to use because of lacking GUI
%pause
&A Strange Licenses
%pause
&A Orphaned upstream
%pause
&A Porting issues (architectures, byte order, 32 vis 64 bit)
%pause
&A Data format not exchangeable
%pause
&A Parallel development of the same functionality
%pause
&a Used tools or back ends are not intended for those applications

%pause
&goal Lack of an integrated framework

Debian for children from 1 to 99

%pause
&A Make Debian an OS that children of all ages will
%cont
%font "it"
 want
%cont
%font "standard"
 to use
%pause
&A Making it so easy that children are not afraid of
%pause
&A Making it so nice that they like it
%pause
&A Making it a playground for children experiments
%pause
&A Not only providing games but care for their quality

   comfortable with using Debian without any special modifications

Debian Multimedia Distribution

%pause
&A Currently not announced as official internal project but coordinator is in touch
%pause
&A Oriented toward music and multimedia
%pause
&A Make GNU/Linux a platform of choice for the musician \
   and the multimedia artist
%pause
&A Part of a project funded by the European Community, called AGNULA

&A Initiator is not yet Debian developer but you are able to work on Debian \
   without being an official developer

Why not just forking from Debian?

&A Separate distribution would cost extra effort
%pause
&B    Would be hardly better than Debian
%pause
&B    Continuous work to keep base system boot-floppies etc up to date
%pause
&B    Nearly impossible to get security fixes as fast as Debian
%pause
&bconc Forking would be a bad idea.

%pause
&A Integration into Debian has advantages
%pause
&B    Huge user base all over the world thus becoming public on the back of Debian
%pause
&B    Secure and stable system without extra effort
%pause
&B    Bug Tracking System for free
%pause
&B    Infra structure (HTTP-, FTP-, Mailserver, PKI, ...) for free

%pause
&A Bringing back something to Debian
%pause
&B    Enhancing quality of packages by making them more user friendly

Debian - adaptable for any purpose?

%pause
&A Developed by about 1000 volunteers
%pause
&A Flexible, not bound on commercial interest
%pause
&A Strict rules (policy) glue all things together
%pause
&A Common interest of each individual developer to get the best operating \
   system for himself
%pause
&A Developers have children in real life or work in the field of medicine etc.
%pause
&A In contrast to employees of companies every single Debian developer has the \
   freedom and ability to realize his vision
%pause
&A Thus single developers have influence on development - they just have to

 it

%pause
&bconc Safety against accidental removal of dependencies
%pause
&bconc Conflicts to incompatible packages
%pause
&bconc Easy installation
%pause
&bconc Low effort for administration

%pause
&A Adapted configuration inside meta packages
%pause

Future handling of meta packages


%pause
&a Obviously there are no nifty tools as you might know them from Debian available yet.

%pause
&a Policy agreement about additional flag for 
%cont

%cont
%font "standard"
file

%pause
&a Find a set of keywords for each internal project and write a tool to search comfortable
   

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Tools to develop meta packages

%pause
&A Building a meta package is more or less equal for each meta package
%pause
&A Those stuff should be parameterized and supported by tools to
%pause
&bconc Make it easier
%pause
&bconc Reduce probability of bugs
%pause
&A There is no common agreement about this but at least Debian-Med is using the 
%cont
%font "typewriter"
med-common-dev 
%cont
%font "standard"
for package building
%pause
&A Each Debian-Med package build-depends from this package which provides \
   templates and tools for meta package building and some examples
