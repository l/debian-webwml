<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>
The operating system Linux is widely established for servers of all
range and is gaining acceptance also for the tasks of end users at
desktop systems.  The main arguments for this development are security
and total cost of ownership.  There is a great interest in office
applications because there is a wide basis of users which enables the
necessary pool of developers of Free Software.
</p><p>
Regarding to special tasks for instance managing a medical practice
there is a much smaller set of users and thus the number of gifted
programmers among this set of users is drastically smaller compared to
everyday usage.  However, in the last time Free Software also tried to
address several different special fields and there are chances that
also in those fields Free Software applications might possibly compete
against proprietary products.
</p><p>
By all means this trend makes sense also by a commercial point of
view.  The need for support and maintenance in those special fields is
much higher than in more general applications and requires special
knowledge of competent experts.  In this respect the pure costs of the
software license does not play an important role which enables
interesting business models for support.
</p><p>
The talk gives an overview about the current state of free software
for medicine ranging from medical practice management up to
microbiological research.  Moreover it draws a sketch how all this
software will be integrated into the Debian GNU/Linux distribution by
the so called Debian-Med project. The reasons for the
advantages of a unique integrating platform will be discussed and
reasons were given why Debian GNU/Linux was chosen for this purpose.

    Free Software</a></h2>

<div class="defh">1. Free Redistribution</div>
<div class="deft">
  The license of a Debian component may not restrict any party from
  selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate
  software distribution containing programs from several different
  sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such
  sale.
</div>
<div class="defh">2. Source Code</div>
<div class="deft">
      The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in
      source code as well as compiled form.
</div>
<div class="defh">3. Derived Works</div>
<div class="deft">
      The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow
      them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the
      original software.
</div>
<div class="defh">4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code</div>
<div class="deft">
      The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified
      form _only_ if the license allows the distribution of "patch files"
      with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build
      time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built
      from modified source code. The license may require derived works to
      carry a different name or version number from the original software.
      (This is a compromise. The Debian group encourages all authors not to
      restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.)
</div>
<div class="defh">5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</div>

      The license must not discriminate against any person or group of

<div class="defh">6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</div>
<div class="deft">
      The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in
      a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the
      program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic
      research.
</div>
<div class="defh">7. Distribution of License</div>
<div class="deft">
      The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the
      program is redistributed without the need for execution of an
      additional license by those parties.
</div>
<div class="defh">8. License Must Not Be Specific to Debian</div>
<div class="deft">
      The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's
      being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian
      and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms
      of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is
      redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in
      conjunction with the Debian system.
</div>
<div class="defh">9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Software</div>
<div class="deft">
      The license must not place restrictions on other software that is
      distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license
      must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium
      must be free software.
</div>
<div class="defh">Example Licenses</div>
<div class="deft">
      The "GPL", "BSD", and "Artistic" licenses are examples of licenses that
      we consider "free".
