Reasons for this variety?




&AL Historical reasons
%pause
&AL Less popularity
%pause
&AL Different technological decisions
%pause
&AL Different concepts

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

What is free Software

%pause
&X 1. Free Redistribution
&xc   The license of a Debian component may not restrict any party from \
      selling or giving away the software as a component of an aggregate \
      software distribution containing programs from several different \
      sources. The license may not require a royalty or other fee for such sale.

%pause
&X 2. Source Code
&xc   The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in \
      source code as well as compiled form.

%pause
&X 3. Derived Works
&xc   The license must allow modifications and derived works, and must allow \
      them to be distributed under the same terms as the license of the \
      original software.

%pause
&X 4. Integrity of The Author's Source Code
&xc   The license may restrict source-code from being distributed in modified \
      form _only_ if the license allows the distribution of "patch files" \
      with the source code for the purpose of modifying the program at build \
      time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of software built \
      from modified source code. The license may require derived works to  \
      carry a different name or version number from the original software. \
      (This is a compromise. The Debian group encourages all authors not to \
      restrict any files, source or binary, from being modified.)

%pause
&X 5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups
&xc   The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page
%nodefault
%leftfill
%bgrad 0 0 48 0 1 "black" "darkblue"
%font "standard"
&X 6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor
&xc   The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in \
      a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the \
      program from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic \
      research.

%pause
&X 7. Distribution of License
&xc   The rights attached to the program must apply to all to whom the \
      program is redistributed without the need for execution of an \
      additional license by those parties.

%pause
&X 8. License Must Not Be Specific to Debian
&xc   The rights attached to the program must not depend on the program's \
      being part of a Debian system. If the program is extracted from Debian \
      and used or distributed without Debian but otherwise within the terms \
      of the program's license, all parties to whom the program is \
      redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in \
      conjunction with the Debian system.

%pause
&X 9. License Must Not Contaminate Other Software
&xc   The license must not place restrictions on other software that is \
      distributed along with the licensed software. For example, the license \
      must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium \
      must be free software.

%pause
&X Example Licenses
&xc   The "GPL", "BSD", and "Artistic" licenses are examples of licenses that \
      we consider "free".

What is Debian?

%pause
&a Linux is just the kernel of your operating system.

%pause
&a You need a lot of applications around.

%pause
&a Those collections of software around the Linux kernel is called distribution.

%pause
&a Companies who build such distributions are called distributors.

%pause
&a They make money by selling their distribution in boxes, doing support and training.

%pause
&a You might know Mandrake, RedHat, Suse and others.

%pause
&a Debian is just one of them.

What is Debian? (next try)


The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made \
common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system \
that we have created is called \

%center
Debian GNU/Linux,

%leftfill
or simply Debian for short.

Moreover, work is in progress to provide Debian for other than Linux \
kernels, primarily for the Hurd.  Other possible kernels are BSD and \
even ports to MS Windows are planed.

Differences to other distributions

&A Debian is no company but an organisation.
%pause
&A It does not sell anything.
%pause
&A Debian members (maintainers) are volunteers.
%pause
&A Maintainers are working on the common goal: building the best operating \
   system they could afford
%pause
&A Largest collection of ready-to-install Free Software on the Internet
%pause
&a Two ways to obtain Debian GNU/Linux
%pause
&b   Buying it from any 
%cont
%font "it"
 other
%cont 
%font "standard"
 distributor on CD
%pause
&B   Downloading from the Web for free
%pause
&A The later is the common way and there are really great tools to do it this way.

What is Debian-Med?


%pause
&AL Debian internal project
%pause
&AL Completely integrated into Debian
%pause
&A Special care for the quality of program packages in the field of medicine \
   which are integrated in Debian yet
%pause
&AL Building packages of medical software which is missing inside Debian and \
   inclusion of those packages
%pause
&AL Caring for a general infrastructure for medical users

Why using Debian for medical care?


%pause
&A Focus on security and stability
%pause
&A Powerful packaging tools
%pause
&A Strong quality assurance, carefully tested
%pause
&A Strict rules (policy)
%pause
&A Developed by about 1000 volunteers
%pause
&A Support of 11 hardware architectures 
%cont
%size 3
(auto builders: alpha, arm, hppa, i386, ia64, m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390, sparc)
%pause
&A Single developers have influence on development - they just have to
%cont
%font "bi"
 do
%cont
%font "standard"
 it


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

How does it work?

%pause
&A Collection of medical software by meta packages
%pause
&bconc No research for available medical software necessary
%pause
&bconc User is not forced to browse the whole package list of Debian
%pause
&bconc Easy comparison between software covering the same task
%pause
&bconc Safety against accidental removal of dependencies
%pause
&bconc Conflicts to incompatible packages
%pause
&bconc Easy installation
%pause
&bconc Low effort for administration

%pause
&A Adapted configuration inside meta packages
%pause
&bconc Care for special needs of Debian-Med users

%pause
&A Documentation packages
%pause
&B    Packaging and creating of relevant documentation
%pause
&B    Translation


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%page

Role: Debian-Med user


&A System administrator defines group of medicine users
%pause
&A Extra menu "Med"
%pause
&A Users of role Med could have extra configuration
%pause
&A Do not bother other users with those additional stuff


%center
%pause
%font "bi"
Debian-Med does not develop medical software.

%pause
It cares just for smooth integration of third party software into Debian.

&AL Apply Debian standards of quality to medical software
%pause
&AL Supporting developers
