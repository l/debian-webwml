<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Med is a
   "<a href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/paper-cdd/debian-cdd.html/">Customized Debian Distribution</a>"
   with the aim to
   develop Debian into an operating
   system that is particularly well fit for the requirements for medical
   practice and research.
   The goal of Debian-Med is a complete system for all
   tasks in medical care which is build completely on free software.
</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the
   <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a> project.
</p>

<p>Debian-Med contains a set of meta packages that declare dependencies on
   other Debian packages, and that way the complete system is prepared for
   solving particular tasks.

<h2><a id="goals" name="goals">Project goals</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Build a solid software base for medical health care with emphasis on easy
      installation, easy maintenance and security.</li>
  <li>Bring authors of different projects with similar goals together.</li>
# "Encourage the co-operation of authors of different software projects with
#  similar goals" would be more in line with the German text /peterk
  <li>Test suite for easy evaluation of the quality of medical software.</li>
  <li>Provide information and documentation of medical software.</li>
  <li>Help upstream authors to get their products packaged for
      Debian.</li>
  <li>Show commercial software companies the strengths of a solid base
      system and make them consider to port their software to Linux or
      even to switch to Open Source.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="talks" name="talks">Talks about Debian-Med</a></h2>

There are some <a href="talks/">talks about Debian-Med</a> available

as source and preformatted slides.  It might be a good idea to
check these pages to get some interesting information
about the project.


<h2><a id="help" name="help">What can I do to help?</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work on enhancing and translating these web pages.</li>
  <li>Create a logo. Some <a
      href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/logos/">Suggestions
      for possible logos</a> are available.  Further proposals of
      skilled artists are welcome.</li>
  <li>Packaging the above-mentioned software projects for Debian.</li>
  <li>Building meta packages for different tasks.</li>
  <li>Documentation and translation.</li>
  <li>Internationalization (which is more than just translating
      because of the different systems of health care).</li>
  <li>Building a live CD (perhaps based on <a
      href="http://www.knoppix.de">Knoppix</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="marketing" name="marketing">Marketing &amp; PR</a></h2>

<p>Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in
   the formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the
   eyes of the world.  We will necessarily want to work with
   press@debian.org to get the word out and to help give Debian and
   this project the kind of exposure we want.  For this purpose we will
   build a collection of slides of talks about Debian-Med.
