<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Med is a
   "<a href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/paper-cdd/debian-cdd.html/">Custom
   Debian Distribution</a>"
   with the aim to
   develop Debian into an operating
   system that is particularly well fit for the requirements for medical
   practice and research.
   The goal of Debian-Med is a complete system for all
   tasks in medical care which is built completely on free software.
</p>

<p>For a more in-depth discussion, there's a
   <a href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/paper/debian-med.html">talk
   available</a> (in English) which covers almost everything you need to
   know.
</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the
   <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a> project.
</p>

<p>Debian-Med contains a set of meta packages that declare dependencies on
   other Debian packages, and that way the complete system is prepared for
   solving particular tasks.

<h2>Contact and developer information</h2>

<p>
The <a href="mailto:debian-med@lists.debian.org">Debian-Med mailing
list</a> is the central point of communication
for Debian-Med. It serves as a forum for potential, as well as current,
users of the Debian system who want to use their computer for
medical tasks. Additionally, it is used to coordinate development
efforts around the various topics of Medicine. You can subscribe to
and unsubscribe from it using the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-med/">list web page</a>.
You will also find the list archives on that page.
</p>
<p>
There are two important places for developer information:
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianMed">The Wiki page</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://debian-med.alioth.debian.org/">Developer information page</a>
      that contains dynamical information about project members, SVN commits,
      status information about Debian-Med specific packages etc.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

   the best.  Please send any suggestions for improvements to our

<h2>Project goals</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Build a solid software base for medical health care with emphasis on easy
      installation, easy maintenance and security.</li>
  <li>Encourage the co-operation of authors of different software projects
      with similar goals.</li>
  <li>Test suite for easy evaluation of the quality of medical software.</li>
  <li>Provide information and documentation of medical software.</li>
  <li>Help upstream authors to get their products packaged for
      Debian.</li>
  <li>Show commercial software companies the strengths of a solid base
      system and make them consider to port their software to Linux or
      even to switch to Open Source.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Talks about Debian-Med</h2>

<p>
There are some
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/talks/">talks
about Debian-Med</a> available online
as source and preformatted slides.  It might be a good idea to
check these pages to get some interesting information
about the project.
</p>


<h2>Alioth projects</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/pkg-mozilla-bio/">Bioinformatics
    extensions to Mozilla</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://alioth.debian.org/projects/cdd/">Custom Debian

<h2>What can I do to help?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work on enhancing and translating these web pages.</li>
  <li>Create a logo. Some <a
      href="http://people.debian.org/~tille/debian-med/logos/">suggestions
      for possible logos</a> are available.  Further proposals of
      skilled artists are welcome.</li>
  <li>Packaging software projects for Debian. We use the Debian BTS
      with usertags to keep track of useful projects. Have a look at the
      <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?pkg=wnpp&amp;\
usertag=debian-med@lists.debian.org&amp;pend-exc=done">current list</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Building meta packages for different tasks.</li>
  <li>Documentation and translation.</li>
  <li>Internationalization (which is more than just translating
      because of the different systems of health care).</li>
  <li>Building a live CD (perhaps based on <a
      href="http://www.knoppix.de/">Knoppix</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Marketing &amp; PR</h2>

<p>Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in
   the formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the
   eyes of the world.  We will necessarily want to work with
   press@debian.org to get the word out and to help give Debian and
   this project the kind of exposure we want.  For this purpose we will
   build a collection of slides of talks about Debian-Med.
