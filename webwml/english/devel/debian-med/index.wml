<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Med is an internal project to develop Debian into an operating
   system that is particularly well fit for the requirements for medical
   practice and research.
   The goal of Debian-Med is a complete system for all
   tasks in medical care which is build completely on free software.
</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the
   <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a> project.
</p>

<p>Debian-Med contains a set of meta packages that declare dependencies on
   other Debian packages, and that way the complete system is prepared for
   solving particular tasks.

  <li>Help upstream authors to get their products packaged for
      Debian.</li>
  <li>Show commercial software companies the strengths of a solid base

<h2>Marketing &amp; PR</h2>

<p>Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in
   the formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the
   eyes of the world.  We will necessarily want to work with
   press@debian.org to get the word out and to help give Debian and
   this project the kind of exposure we want.  For this purpose we will
   build a collection of slides of talks about Debian-Med.
