<h2>Project description</h2>

<p>Debian-Med is an Debian internal project to support tasks of people in
   medical care. The goal of Debian-Med is a complete system for all
   tasks in medical care which is build completely on free software.
</p>

<p>The general idea is adopted from the <a
   href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian-Junior</a> project.
</p>

<p>So we provide a set of packages which have dependencies from Debian
   packages which help solving certain tasks.
</p>

<p>After the first intent to start this project I have got many
   positive responses with a lot of suggestions and hints.  I tried to
   include all these suggestions in this official announcement of the
   project.  Please continue the discussion at the Debian-Med mailing
   list.

<a id="help" name="help">
<h2>What can I do to help?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Work on enhancing and translating this web pages.</li>
  <li>Logo. Perhaps some skilled painter could take the idea of the GnuMed
      logo and replace the GNU by the Debian swirl - just an idea.</li>
  <li>Packaging the software projects.</li>
  <li>Building meta packages for different tasks.</li>
  <li>Documentation and Translation</li>
  <li>Internationalisation (which is more than just translation
      because of the different systems of health care)</li>
  <li>Building a live CD (perhaps based on <a
      href="www.knoppix.de">Knoppix</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Marketing &amp; PR</h2>

<p>Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in
   the formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the
   eyes of the world.  We will necessarily want to work with
   press@debian.org to get the word out and to help give Debian and
   this project the kind of exposure we want.  For this purpose we will
   build a collection of slides of talks about Debian-Med.
