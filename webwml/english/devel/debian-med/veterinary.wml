Animal Shelter Manager</a></h3>

<p>
 Animal Shelter Manager is a free computer package, covered by the terms
 of the GNU General Public Licence. It is designed to take most (if not all)
 of the paperwork away from running an animal shelter/sanctuary. The system
 can also be used to manage a veterinary surgery or clinic.

Unfortunately this project seems to be dead.  In fact its original
home page seems to be offline.  Everybody who might have interest
should try to drop in here and should continue development.
The link points to the tarball of FreeVet 1.1.1.
