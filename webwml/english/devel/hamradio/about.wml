<p>The <b>Debian Hamradio Pure Blend</b> is a project of the <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianHams/">Debian Hamradio Maintainers Team</a>
who collaborate on maintenance of amateur-radio related packages for Debian.
Every <a href="http://blends.debian.org/">Pure Blend</a> is a subset of Debian
that is configured to support a particular target group out-of-the-box. This
blend aims to support the needs of radio amateurs.</p>

<p>The Blend is built from a curated list of amateur radio software in Debian.
The two main outputs from the Blend are a collection of "metapackages" and live
images that can be put onto a DVD or a USB stick.</p>
