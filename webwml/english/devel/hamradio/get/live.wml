<p>The Debian Hamradio Pure Blend produces <b>Live DVD images</b> that can
be used to try out the Debian Hamradio Pure Blend on a computer without
having to install it first. The images also contain an installer which can
be used to install Debian along with the packages from the blend.</p>

<h2>Debian Hamradio Blend Jessie Preview</h2>

<p>A preview release of the Debian Hamradio Blend Live DVD is available
for download. This is an unofficial release as the blend metapackages are
not included in Debian Jessie.</p>

<h2>Debian Hamradio Blend Stretch</h2>

<p>In the near future, live DVDs will be built for stretch (the current
Debian testing distribution) although these are not currently
available.</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Using a DVD</h3>

<p>Most modern operating systems will have provisions for burning ISO images
to DVD media. There are too many options to describe here. If you are having
difficulty, using a web search engine should provide the answers you need.</p>

<h3>Using a USB stick</h3>

<p>The ISO images are built as hybrid images, so you can copy them directly to
a USB stick without using any special software like unetbootin. On a Linux
system, you can do this like so:</p>

<pre>sudo dd if=/path/to/debian-hamradio-live-image.iso of=/dev/sd<b>X</b></pre>

<p>The output of the dmesg command should let you know the device name of the
USB stick where you will need to change the <b>X</b> to the letter given.</p>
