#use wml::debian::template title="Extract PGP Key"

There are two methods for extracting a developers' key. One method is
to search for the developer in the
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">Developers' Database</a> and then click
on the PGP/GPG fingerprint once you have found them.
The second method is to <em>finger</em> command. You must already know
the developers' userid. If the developer's userid is <em>foo</em>, then
the key will be a part of the results from <em>finger foo@db.debian.org</em>.
