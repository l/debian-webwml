#use wml::debian::template title="Extracting a developer's PGP/GPG Key"

<p>One method is to search for the developer in the
<a href="http://db.debian.org/">Developers' Database</a> and then click
on the ``PGP/GPG fingerprint'' link(s) once you have found them.

<p>The second method is to use
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/finger.html">finger</a></code>.
You must already know the developers' userid. If the developer's userid is
<em>foo</em>, then the key will be a part of the results from <code>finger
foo@db.debian.org</code>.
