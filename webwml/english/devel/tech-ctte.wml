<p>The Technical Committee is established by the
<a href="constitution">Debian Constitution</a>, section 6.  It is the body
which makes the final decision on technical disputes in the Debian project.
</p>

<h2>How to refer a question to the committee</h2>

<ol>

<li>Before referring a decision to the Technical Committee, you should try
    to resolve it yourself.  Engage in a constructive discussion and try
    to understand the other person's point of view.  If, after discussion,
    you've identified a technical question which you can't agree on, you
    can put it to the committee:
</li>

<li>Write up a summary of the disagreement, preferably agreeing it with
    your opponent, and send it to the bug tracking system.  Reassign the
    bug report to the pseudo-package <tt>tech-ctte</tt>.  If there is no
    bug for the dispute yet, file one.
</li>

<li>The committee will discuss your question on the committee mailing list,
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-ctte/">debian-ctte@lists.debian.org</a>.
    We will not CC all of our discussion to the bug report, though we may
    CC the participants.  Anyone else who wishes to do so may subscribe to
    the debian-ctte mailing list and see our deliberations.
</li>

<li>The committee will aim to make a decision as soon as possible.  In
    practice this process is likely to take many weeks, or perhaps
    longer.  If the question is particularly urgent please say so.
</li>

<li>Sometimes, one side or other is convinced, during the committee's
    deliberations, by the merit of the other side's arguments.  This is a
    good thing!  If it happens, the committee need not make a formal
    decision, and the bug report can be closed, or reassigned, as appropriate.
</li>

</ol>

<h3>Some caveats about contacting the committee</h3>

<ul>

<li>A sound and vigorous debate is important to ensure that all the
    aspects of an issue are fully explored.  When discussing technical
    questions with other developers you should be ready to be challenged.
    You should also be prepared to be convinced!  There is no shame in
    seeing the merit of good arguments.
</li>

<li>Please conduct your technical discussions with other maintainers
    in a calm and civilised way; do not use insults, or question their
    competence.  Instead, address yourself to your opponents' arguments.
</li>

<li>The committee is only empowered to make technical decisions.  If
    you feel that someone has been misbehaving, the committee probably
    can't help you much.  You may wish to talk to the Project Leader,
    <tt>leader@debian.org</tt>.
</li>

<li>To post to the committee mailing list you must either be
    subscribed to the list from your posting address, or PGP-sign your
    message.  This is an anti-spam measure.  We apologise for the
    inconvenience, but this setup makes it possible for committee
    members to pay proper attention to the committee list mails.
