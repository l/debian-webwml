#use wml::debian::template title="Developer Locations"

<p>Many people have expressed interest in information on the
location of Debian developers.
We therefore decided to add, as part of the developer database
a field where developers can specify their world coordinates.

<p>The map below was generated from an anonymized
<a href="developers.coords">list of developer coordinates</a>
using the program
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/graphics/xplanet">
xplanet</a>.

<p><img src="developers.map.jpeg" alt="World Map">

<p>If you are a developer and would like to add your coordinates
to your database entry, log in to the
<a href="https://db.debian.org">Debian Developers' Database</a>
and modify your entry. If you don't know the coordinates of your
hometown, You should be able to find it from one of the following
locations:
<ul>
<li>Coordinates of places all around the world, with exact maps for
    USA, Canada and most of Europe: <url "http://www.multimap.com/">
<li>Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names: 
    <url "http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabulary/tgn/">
<li>Good starting point: <url "http://www.ckdhr.com/dns-loc/finding.html">
<li>GPS locations for airports: <url "http://www.airnav.com/">
<li>By zip code (US only): <url "http://www.geocode.com/eagle.html-ssi">
<li>Australian database:
    <url "http://www.ga.gov.au/map/names/">
<li>Canadian database: <url "http://GeoNames.NRCan.gc.ca/">
<li>Get your coordinates and horoscope too:
    <url "http://www.astro.com/cgi/aq.cgi?lang=e">
# lang=g yields the German version
</ul>

<p>The format for coordinates is one of the following:
<dl>
<dt>Decimal Degrees
<dd>The format is +-DDD.DDDDDDDDDDDDDDD.  This  is  the
    format programs like xearth use and the format that
    many positioning web sites use.  However  typically
    the precision is limited to 4 or 5 decimals.
<dt>Degrees Minutes (DGM)
<dd>The  format  is +-DDDMM.MMMMMMMMMMMMM. It is not an
    arithmetic type, but a packed representation of two
    separate units, degrees and minutes. This output is
    common from some types of hand held GPS  units  and
    from NMEA format GPS messages.
<dt>Degrees Minutes Seconds (DGMS)
<dd>The  format  is +-DDDMMSS.SSSSSSSSSSS. Like DGM, it
    is not an arithmetic type but a packed  representation
    of  three separate units: degrees, minutes and
    seconds. This output is typically derived from  web
    sites  that  give 3  values for each position. For
    instance 34:50:12.24523 North might be the position
    given, in DGMS it would be +0345012.24523.
</dl>

<p>
For  Latitude  + is North, for Longitude + is East. It is
important to specify enough leading zeros to dis-ambiguate
the  format  that  is  being used if your position is less
than 2 degrees from a zero point.
