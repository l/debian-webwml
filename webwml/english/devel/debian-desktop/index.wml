<h2>The Universal Operating System as your Desktop</h2>

<p>
  The Debian Desktop subproject is a group of volunteers who want to
  create the best possible operating system for home and corporate
  workstation use.  Our motto is "Software which Just Works".  In
  short, our goal is to bring Debian, GNU, and Linux to the mainstream
  world.

<h3>Our tenents</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Recognizing that both <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a>
    and <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> exist, we will support
    the use of both, and make sure they work well on Debian.
  </li>
  <li>
    We recognize that there are only two classes of users: the
    novice, and the expert.  We will do everything we can to make
    things very easy for the novice, while allowing the expert to
    tweak things if they like.
  </li>
  <li>
    In line with our motto, we will work to support and improve all
    software which eases the burden of configuration required by the
    end user.  This means we will integrate software such as
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/discover">discover</a> into
    the Debian installation process and the running Debian system.  We
    will make sure that configuring
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/x-window-system">XFree86</a> is
    as easy and foolproof as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will try to ensure that software is configured for the most
    common desktop use.  For instance, the regular user account
    added by default during installation should have permission to
    play audio and video, print, and manage the system through sudo.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will integrate an easy-to-use system management utility into
    the standard Debian installation.  There are several choices in
    this area; <a href="http://packages.debian.org/webmin">webmin</a> and
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ximian-setup-tools">Ximian Setup Tools</a> look the
    most promising.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will try to ensure that questions which are asked of the user
    (which should be kept to a minimum) make sense even with a
    minimum of computer knowledge.  Many Debian packages today
    present the user with difficult technical details.  For example,
    if you simply select the "desktop environment" and "development
    environment" tasks during a woody installation, the first thing
    you will be presented with after all the packages are downloaded
    is a debconf prompt from
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/binutils">binutils</a> about
    "kernel link failure info". To the novice, this kind of thing is
    confusing and frightening.  To the expert, this is annoying and
    unnecessary.  Right after this question is one from
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/less">less</a> which asks
    something inane about a MIME handler.  A novice doesn't even
    know what MIME is.  An expert can configure less however they
    like it after the installation is complete.
  <li>
    And we will have fun doing all of it!
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>
  The most important parts of a Debian subproject aren't mailing
  lists, web pages, or archive space for packages.  The most
  important part is <em>motivated people</em> who make things
  happen.  You don't need to be an official developer to start
  making packages and patches.  The core Debian Desktop team will
  ensure that your work is integrated.  So here's some things you
  can do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Help in finishing integrating GNOME 2 into Debian unstable.
    See <a href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/gnome2.html">Colin's Debian GNOME 2 page</a>
    for more information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Help <a href="mailto:lawrencc@debian.org">Chris Lawrence</a>
    with the <a href="http://phys251.phy.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/">menu rewrite</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finish integrating KDE 3 into Debian unstable.
    <em>This is currently blocked on the gcc-3.2 transition</em>
  </li>
  <li>
    Work on <a href="http://cvs.debian.org/debian-installer">debian-installer</a>.  We especially need an X/gtkfb port.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out how we could best integrate
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/webmin">webmin</a> into the
    core distribution.  A simple way would be to create a patch add
    this to <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debootstrap">debootstrap</a>'s
    idea of a base system.  A better way might be to allow
    debootstrap to have "flavors" of installation.  The "desktop"
    flavor could then install webmin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work on removing unnecessary
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debconf">debconf</a> prompts
    from packages, and making the ones that are necessary easy to understand.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tackle any of the projects on the
    <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/todo/">Debian TODO list</a>;
    after all, Debian Desktop couldn't work without Debian!
  </li>
  <li>
    Create Debian themes for software like GNOME and KDE.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sending patches to add other things to add to this list!
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Discussion of Debian Desktop</h3>
<p>
  For now, in line with the other subprojects, we are just going to
  use <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel">debian-devel</a> as
  our discussion list.  Subjects should be prefixed
  with <samp>[desktop]</samp> to keep them easy to distinguish.
</p>
<h3>IRC Channel</h3>
<p>
  We encourage anyone (Debian Developer or not) who is interested in
  Debian Desktop to join #debian-devel on
  <a href="http://freenode.info">Freenode IRC</a> (irc.debian.org).
</p>
<h3>Who's involved in Debian Desktop</h3>
<p>
  First of all, anyone who wants to be!  Right now however the project
  (i.e. this web page) is maintained by <a href="http://people.debian.org/~walters/">Colin Walters</a>.
