<h2>The Universal Operating System as your Desktop</h2>

<p>
  The Debian Desktop subproject is a group of volunteers who want to
  create the best possible operating system for home and corporate
  workstation use.  Our motto is "Software that Just Works".  In
  short, our goal is to bring Debian, GNU, and Linux to the mainstream
  world.
  <img style="float: right;" src="debian-desktop.png" alt=""/>
</p>
<h3>Our tenets</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Recognizing that both <a href="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME</a> and 
    <a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a> as well as many Desktop frameworks 
    like <a href="http://www.gnustep.org/">GNUstep</a>, <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a>,  
    <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/">Qt</a> and others exist, we will 
    support the use of them, and make sure they work well on Debian.  
    KDE and GNOME are the primary choices for a default environment for 
    the end user.  Supporting other desktop environments such as <a href="http://www.xfce.org/">XFCE</a>
    would be nice as well, depending on developer time and space constraints.
  </li>
  <li>
    We recognize that there are only two important classes of users:
    the novice, and the expert.  We will do everything we can to make
    things very easy for the novice, while allowing the expert to
    tweak things if they like.
  </li>
  <li>
    In line with our motto, we will work to support and improve all
    software which eases the burden of configuration required by the
    end user.  This means we will integrate software such as
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/discover">discover</a> into
    the Debian installation process and the running Debian system.  We
    will make sure that configuring
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/x-window-system">XFree86</a> is
    as easy and foolproof as possible.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will try to ensure that software is configured for the most
    common desktop use.  For instance, the regular user account
    added by default during installation should have permission to
    play audio and video, print, and manage the system through sudo.
  </li>
  <li>
    We will integrate an easy-to-use system management utility into
    the standard Debian installation.  There are several choices in
    this area; <a href="http://packages.debian.org/webmin">webmin</a> and
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gnome-system-tools">GNOME
    System Tools</a> look the most promising.  There is also the
    <a href="http://magiconf.sheflug.co.uk/">MagiConf</a> project.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
    We will try to ensure that questions which are asked of the user
    (which should be kept to a minimum) make sense even with a
    minimum of computer knowledge.  Many Debian packages today
    present the user with difficult technical details.  For example,
    if you simply select the "desktop environment" and "development
    environment" tasks during a woody installation, the first thing
    you will be presented with after all the packages are downloaded
    is a debconf prompt from
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/binutils">binutils</a> about
    "kernel link failure info". To the novice, this kind of thing is
    confusing and frightening.  To the expert, this is annoying and
    unnecessary.  Right after this question is one from
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/less">less</a> which asks
    something about a MIME handler.  A novice doesn't even know
    what MIME is.  An expert can configure less however they like it
    after the installation is complete.  The priority of these kinds
    of Debconf questions should be at least lowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      (Happily, many of these issues are already fixed for
      the <samp>sarge</samp> release
      using <samp>debian-installer</samp>, which will make the
      default debconf priority be "high").
    </p>
  <li>
    And we will have fun doing all of it!
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>How you can help</h3>
<p>
  The most important parts of a Debian subproject aren't mailing
  lists, web pages, or archive space for packages.  The most
  important part is <em>motivated people</em> who make things
  happen.  You don't need to be an official developer to start
  making packages and patches.  The core Debian Desktop team will
  ensure that your work is integrated.  So here's some things you
  can do:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Help <a href="mailto:lawrencc@debian.org">Chris Lawrence</a>
    with the <a href="http://phys251.phy.olemiss.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/">menu rewrite</a>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Finish integrating KDE 3 into Debian unstable.
    See <a href="http://davidpashley.com/debian-kde/faq.html">The Debian KDE FAQ</a> for information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Work on <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>.  We especially need an X/gtkfb port.
  </li>
  <li>
    Figure out how we could best integrate
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/webmin">webmin</a> and/or <a
    href="http://packages.debian.org/gnome-system-tools">GNOME System
    Tools</a> into the core distribution.  A simple way would be to
    create a patch and add this to
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debootstrap">debootstrap</a>'s
    idea of a base system.  A better way might be to allow debootstrap
    to have "flavors" of installation.  The "desktop" flavor could
    then install webmin.

  <li>
    Bug ppp maintainer to remove the fscking defaultroute on
    triggering a connection. (Eduard Bloch)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bug Overfiend to warn on insane module configurations in xfree86's
    config. (Eduard Bloch)
  </li>
  <li>
    Install hotplug as base package and load usb/firewire drivers
    (Eduard Bloch).
  </li>
  <li>
    Finish internationalization and multilingualization of Debian.
    This involves many different aspects, such as the
    <a href="http://ddtp.debian.org/">Debian Description Translation Project</a>.
    Also, Charles de Miramon writes:
    <blockquote>
    <p>
      There should be more intelligence in the Debian package
      management to ask you when you install a package (KDE / Gnome)
      if you want to install the documentation in your language.
      There should also be an overhaul of the standard localisation
      package with integration of the euro package for the countries
      where euro is the official currency.  In France, Debian will
      never be mainstream if the system is not in French.
    </p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    Work on lowering the priority of, or removing unnecessary
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/debconf">debconf</a> prompts
    from packages, and making the ones that are necessary easy to understand.
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Create a Debian package of Linux optimized for Desktop use.  Luke Seubert writes:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>
      A kernel can be optimized so that the desktop is much more responsive and
      usable.  (Also, hdparm settings can be tweaked during installation to safely
      maximize hard drive performance, but enough on that for now.)  Various
      patches, such as the low latency patch, pre-emptible kernel, supermount,
      etc. can be added to the kernel to make it perform much better on desktop
      computers.  I recommend that Debian Desktop lobby to have an optimized
      desktop kernel added to the various kernels available during installation.
      We should have both single CPU and SMP kernels.  The various patches to
      accomplish these things have been collected and tested by Con Kolivas.  Con
      says that his ck10 patchset is quite stable and well tested.
      <a href="http://members.optusnet.com.au/ckolivas/kernel/">Info on the
      patches</a>, and an
      <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node.php?id=465">interview with
      Kolivas</a> are available.

  <li>
    Tackle any of the projects on the
    <a href="$(DEVEL)/todo/">Debian TODO list</a>;
    after all, Debian Desktop couldn't work without Debian!
  </li>
  <li>
    Create Debian themes for software like GNOME and KDE (about 50%
    done; see the
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/desktop-base">desktop-base</a> package).
  </li>

    Sending patches with other things to add to this list!

<p>
  For now, in line with the other subprojects, we are just going to
  use <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a> as
  our discussion list.  Subjects should be prefixed
  with <samp>[desktop]</samp> to keep them easy to distinguish.
