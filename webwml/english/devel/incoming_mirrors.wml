#use wml::debian::template title="Notes on Incoming"

<p>Incoming is the directory new packages are uploaded to before being
added to the Debian distribution.

<p>Packages in Incoming are totally untested (except possibly by the
package maintainer) so it is possible that they contain packaging errors
or bugs in executables that could render your machine unusable. In
addition, the files in this directory have <em>not</em> been checked by
md5sum or pgp to verify that they are intact or were uploaded by a
registered Debian developer. You can, however, get the <tt>devscripts</tt>
package and use the <em>dscverify</em> script to check the basic validity of
a package.

<p>We recommend that Incoming NOT be mirrored. For access to
the Incoming directory, use <a href="http://incoming.debian.org/">http://incoming.debian.org/</a>

<p>You have been warned.
