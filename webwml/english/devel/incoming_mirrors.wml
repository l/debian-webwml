#use wml::debian::template title="Mirrors of Incoming"

<p>This is a list of mirrors of the <a href="http://incoming.debian.org/">
Incoming directory</a> for new packages to Debian. If you are not familiar
with what this is, then you do <strong>not</strong> want to get packages
from one of these sites.

<p>Packages on these sites are totally untested (except possibly by the
person who packaged it) so it is possible that they contain packaging errors
or bugs in executables that could even render your machine unusable. In
addition, the files in this directory have <em>not</em> been checked by
md5sum or pgp to verify that they are intact or were uploaded by a
registered Debian developer. You can, however, get the <tt>devscripts</tt>
package and use the <em>dscverify</em> script to check the basic validity of
a package.

<p>You have been warned.
