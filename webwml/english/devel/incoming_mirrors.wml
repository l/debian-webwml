<H1>Mirrors of Incoming</H1>

This is a list of mirrors of the Incoming directory for new packages to
Debian. If you are not familiar with what this is, then you do not want
to get packages from one of these sites. Packages on these sites are totally
untested (except possibly by the person who packaged it) so it is possible
that they contain packaging errors or bugs in executables that could render
your machine unusable. 

<P>In addition, the files in this directory have <em>not</em> been checked by md5sum
or pgp to verify that they are intact or were uploaded by a registered debian
developer.

<P>You have been warned.
