<p>Work-Needing and Prospective Packages, WNPP for short, is a list 
of packages in need of new maintainers and prospective packages in Debian.
In order to closely track the real status of such things, WNPP is currently
operated as a pseudo-package in the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">Debian
Bug Tracking System (BTS)</a>.

<p>Note: these lists are updated daily; for more up-to-date information
please check the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/wnpp">wnpp pseudo package</a>
entry in the BTS.

<hr>

<p>Since it uses the BTS, every developer is already familiar with the
technical details, such as submission of new information, modification of
information or closing of pending requests. On the other hand, in order to
achieve the highest level of automatization, some procedures have to be
observed.</p>

<p>In order to submit new information, a bug has to be filed against the
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/wnpp">wnpp pseudo package</a> for each
(prospective) package that is affected.  Please note that you should
only submit one bug per source package rather than one bug for each
binary package built from a source package.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/reportbug">reportbug</a>
(apt-get install reportbug):</p>

<blockquote>
  $ reportbug --email username@domain.tld wnpp<br>
  Using 'Your Name &lt;username@domain.tld&gt;' as your from address.<br>
  Getting status for wnpp...<br>
  Querying Debian bug tracking system for reports on wnpp<br>
  (Use ? for help at prompts.)<br>
  ...<br>
</blockquote>

<p>You will see a list of reported bugs against WNPP which you
should read to prevent a second report for the same package.</p>
<p>After the buglist you are asked for the request type:</p>
 
<blockquote>
What sort of request is this?<br>
<br>
1 ITP  This is an `Intent To Package'. Please submit a package description<br>
       along with copyright and URL in such a report.<br>
<br>
2 O    The package has been `Orphaned'. It needs a new maintainer as soon<br>
       as possible.<br>
<br>
3 RFA  This is a `Request for Adoption'. Due to lack of time, resources,<br>
       interest or something similar, the current maintainer is asking for<br>
       someone else to maintain this package. He/she will maintain it in<br>
       the meantime, but perhaps not in the best possible way. In short:<br>
       the package needs a new maintainer.<br>
<br>
4 RFP  This is a `Request For Package'. You have found an interesting piece<br>
       of software and would like someone else to maintain it for Debian.<br>
       Please submit a package description along with copyright and URL in<br>
       such a report.<br>
<br>
Choose the request type: <br>
</blockquote>

<p>After your selection you will be asked for the package name:</p>

<blockquote>
Choose the request type: x<br>
Please enter the proposed package name: PACKAGENAME<br>
Checking status database...<br>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>If your request type is ITP (1) or RFP (4) you are asked for a short
   description and then for some information about the package:</p>

<blockquote>
Please briefly describe this package; this should be an appropriate short
description for the eventual package:<br>
&gt; A DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
Subject: ITP: PACKAGENAME -- A DESCRIPTION<br>
Package: wnpp<br>
Version: N/A; reported 2002-01-30<br>
Severity: wishlist<br>
<br>
* Package name    : PACKAGENAME<br>
  Version         : x.y.z<br>
  Upstream Author : Name &lt;somebody@some.org&gt;<br>
* URL             : http://www.some.org/<br>
* License         : (GPL, LGPL, BSD, MIT/X, etc.)<br>
  Description     : A DESCRIPTION<br>
<br>
<br>
-- System Information<br>
...<br>
</blockquote>

<p>Below the "Description" line you should give more information
about the package.</p>

<li><p>If your request type is O (2) or RFA (3) you have to enter the name
of the package.</p>

<blockquote>
Choose the request type: x<br>
Please enter the name of the package: PACKAGENAME<br>
Checking status database...<br>
<br>
Subject: O: PACKAGENAME -- SHORT DESCRIPTION<br>
Package: wnpp<br>
Version: N/A; reported 2002-01-30<br>
Severity: normal<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-- System Information<br>
...<br>
</blockquote>

<p>You should add some information about maintaining the package, the upstream
situtation and maybe a reason why you want to give the package away.</p>

</ul>

<p>Then you are asked if you want to send your request:</p>

<blockquote>
Report will be sent to Debian Bug Tracking System &lt;submit@bugs.debian.org&gt;<br>
Submit this bug report (e to edit) [Y|n|i|e|?]? <br>
</blockquote>

<p>It is also possible to report reports/bugs against the WNPP via email.
The format of the submission should be like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org<br>
  Subject: &lt;<i>TAG</i>&gt;: &lt;<b>package name</b>&gt; -- &lt;short package description&gt;<br>
  <br>
  Package: wnpp<br>
  Severity: &lt;see below&gt;<br>
  <br>
  &lt; Some information about the package.  If this is an ITP or RFP an URL
  where the package (either the .deb or the original source) can be downloaded
  from is required, as well as
  information concerning its license. &gt;
</blockquote>

<p>The tags to be used and their corresponding severities are:

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><a name="tag-o"><b>O</b></a></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>normal</i></td>
  <td width="80%">The package has been `Orphaned'. It needs a new maintainer
      as soon as possible. If the package has a Priority higher or equal to
      standard, the severity should be set to important.

<p>The procedures for closing these bugs are as follows:

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><a name="howto-o"><b>O</b></a></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug
      to replace `O' with `ITA', in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted and to prevent its automatic removal from the
      archive. To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and put something like
      <blockquote>
      * New maintainer (Closes: #<var>bugnumber</var>)
      </blockquote>
      in the changelog of the package in order to automatically close this
      bug once the package has been installed; where <var>bugnumber</var>
      has to be replaced with the corresponding bugreport number.
      Furthermore, before you
      actually upload a new package with you as the maintainer, you should
      check if there is a new upstream release and you should try to fix the
      outstanding bugs.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><a name="howto-rfa"><b>RFA</b></a></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug
      to replace `RFA' with `ITA', in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted and to prevent its automatic removal from the
      archive. To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and close this bug once the package has been
      installed.

      <p>If you as the package maintainer decide to orphan the package you
      marked with `RFA', please retitle the bug report and replace `RFA'
      with `O'. If you withdraw your request, please close the bug.
  </td>

  <td valign="top" width="10%"><a name="howto-itp"><b>ITP</b></a></td>
  <td width="90%">package the software, upload it and close this bug once
      the package has been installed.

      <p>If you change your mind, and no longer want to package this, either
      close the bug or retitle and reclassify it as RFP, as you see fit.
  </td>

<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><a name="howto-rfp"><b>RFP</b></a></td>

<p>If you feel that the developers' mailing list should know about your ITP,
RFA or anything else, add the header
<pre>X-Debbugs-CC: debian-devel@lists.debian.org</pre>
to the message (note: that's a real header, not a pseudo-header).

<p>Of course, the easiest way of closing these bugs is to include an entry
in the package changelog saying what you've done and append
<tt>(closes:&nbsp;bug#nnnnn)</tt> to it. This way the bug will be closed
automatically after the new package gets installed into the archive.

<p><strong>Attention:</strong> You can <strong>not</strong> reassign or
retitle bug reports by mailing the report number @bugs.debian.org,
<strong>nor</strong> by filing new reports. You have to send an appropriate
message to the BTS control bot &mdash; <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/server-control">
read the instructions for it</a>!

<p>Note: If a package remains orphaned for a very long time, we will examine
the situation to determine if the package is needed anymore &mdash; if not,
the FTP maintainers will be asked to remove the package from unstable.

<p>If for some reason you need to contact the WNPP maintainers, they can be
reached at <tt>wnpp@debian.org</tt>.
