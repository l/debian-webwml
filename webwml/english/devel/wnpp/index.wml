<p>Work-Needing and Prospective Packages, WNPP for short, is a list 
of packages in need of new maintainers and prospective packages in Debian.
In order to closely track the real status of such things, WNPP is currently
operated as a pseudo-package in the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">Debian
Bug Tracking System (BTS)</a>.</p>

<h2>Using WNPP</h2>

<toc-display />

<p>Since it uses the BTS, every developer is already familiar with the
technical details, such as submission of new information, modification of
information or closing of pending requests. On the other hand, in order to
achieve the highest level of automatization, some procedures have to be
observed.</p>

<p>In order to submit new information, a bug has to be filed against the
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/wnpp">wnpp pseudo package</a> for each
(prospective) package that is affected.  Please note that you should
only submit one bug per source package rather than one bug for each
binary package built from a source package.</p>


<toc-add-entry>Adding new entries with <q>reportbug</q></toc-add-entry>

<p>You can use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/reportbug">reportbug</a>
(<kbd>apt-get install reportbug</kbd>):</p>

<samp>
  $ reportbug --email <var>username@domain.tld</var> wnpp<br />
  Using '<var>Your Name &lt;username@domain.tld&gt;</var>' as your from address.<br />
  Getting status for wnpp...<br />
  Querying Debian bug tracking system for reports on wnpp<br />
  (Use ? for help at prompts.)<br />
  ...<br />
</samp>

<p>You will see a list of reported bugs against WNPP which you
should read to prevent a second report for the same package.</p>
<p>After the buglist you are asked for the request type:</p>
 
<samp>
What sort of request is this?<br />
<br />
1 ITP  This is an <q>Intent To Package</q>. Please submit a package description<br />
       along with copyright and URL in such a report.<br />
<br />
2 O    The package has been <q>Orphaned</q>. It needs a new maintainer as soon<br />
       as possible.<br />
<br />
3 RFA  This is a <q>Request for Adoption</q>. Due to lack of time, resources,<br />
       interest or something similar, the current maintainer is asking for<br />
       someone else to maintain this package. They will maintain it in<br />
       the meantime, but perhaps not in the best possible way. In short:<br />
       the package needs a new maintainer.<br />
<br />
4 RFH  This is a <q>Request For Help</q>. The current maintainer wants to continue<br />
       to maintain this package, but he/she needs some help to do this, because<br />
       his/her time is limited or the package is quite big and needs several<br />
       maintainers.<br />
<br />
5 RFP  This is a <q>Request For Package</q>. You have found an interesting piece<br />
       of software and would like someone else to maintain it for Debian.<br />
       Please submit a package description along with copyright and URL in<br />
       such a report.<br />
<br />
Choose the request type: <br />
</samp>

<p>After your selection you will be asked for the package name:</p>

<samp>
Choose the request type: <var>x</var><br />
Please enter the proposed package name: <var>PACKAGENAME</var><br />
Checking status database...<br />
</samp>

<ul>
<li><p>If your request type is ITP (1) or RFP (4) you are asked for a short
   description and then for some information about the package:</p>

<samp>
Please briefly describe this package; this should be an appropriate short
description for the eventual package:<br />
&gt; <var>A DESCRIPTION</var><br />
<br />
Subject: ITP: <var>PACKAGENAME -- A DESCRIPTION</var><br />
Package: wnpp<br />
Version: N/A; reported 2002-01-30<br />
Severity: wishlist<br />
<br />
* Package name    : <var>PACKAGENAME</var><br />
  Version         : <var>x.y.z</var><br />
  Upstream Author : <var>Name &lt;somebody@some.org&gt;</var><br />
* URL             : <var>http://www.some.org/</var><br />

  Description     : <var>A DESCRIPTION</var><br />
<br />
<br />
-- System Information<br />
...<br />
</samp>

<p>Below the <q>Description</q> line you should give more information
about the package.</p></li>

<li><p>If your request type is O (2) or RFA (3) you have to enter the name
of the package.</p>

<samp>
Choose the request type: <var>x</var><br />
Please enter the name of the package: <var>PACKAGENAME</var><br />
Checking status database...<br />
<br />
Subject: O: <var>PACKAGENAME -- SHORT DESCRIPTION</var><br />
Package: wnpp<br />
Version: N/A; reported 2002-01-30<br />
Severity: normal<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
-- System Information<br />
...<br />
</samp>

<p>You should add some information about maintaining the package, the upstream
situation and maybe a reason why you want to give the package away.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Then you are asked if you want to send your request:</p>

<samp>
Report will be sent to Debian Bug Tracking System &lt;submit@bugs.debian.org&gt;<br />
Submit this bug report (e to edit) [Y|n|i|e|?]? <br />
</samp>


<toc-add-entry>Adding new entries via email</toc-add-entry>

<p>It is also possible to report reports/bugs against the WNPP via email.
The format of the submission should be like this:</p>

<samp>
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org<br />
  Subject: <var>TAG</var>: <var>package name</var> -- <var>short package description</var><br />
  <br />
  Package: wnpp<br />
  Severity: <var>see below</var><br />
  <br />
  <var>Some information about the package.</var>  (If this is an ITP or RFP a URL
  where the package (either the .deb or the original source) can be downloaded
  from is required, as well as
  information concerning its license.)
</samp>

<toc-add-entry>Removing entries</toc-add-entry>

<p>The procedures for closing these bugs are as follows:

<table>
<colgroup span="2">
<col width="10%">
<col width="90%">
</colgroup>
<tr>
  <th valign="top"><a name="howto-o">O</a></th>
  <td>If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug
      to replace <q>O</q> with <q>ITA</q>, in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted and to prevent its automatic removal from the
      archive, and set yourself as the owner of the bug.
      To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and put something like
      <code>
      * New maintainer (Closes: #<var>bugnumber</var>)
      </code>
      in the changelog of the package in order to automatically close this
      bug once the package has been installed; where <var>bugnumber</var>
      has to be replaced with the corresponding bugreport number.
      Furthermore, before you
      actually upload a new package with you as the maintainer, you should
      check if there is a new upstream release and you should try to fix the
      outstanding bugs.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th valign="top"><a name="howto-rfa">RFA</a></th>
  <td>If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug

      To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and close this bug once the package has been
      installed.

      <p>If you as the package maintainer decide to orphan the package you
      marked with <q>RFA</q>, please retitle the bug report and replace <q>RFA</q>
      with <q>O</q>. If you withdraw your request, please close the bug.</p>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th valign="top"><a name="howto-rfh">RFH</a></th>

      submitter, i.e. the package maintainer, if they consider it
      obsolete, either because one or more people have offered
      (and provided) their support or because they now think that
      they can handle the package for themself.

      <p>If you as the package maintainer decides to change the RFH to
      a request for adoption (<q>RFA</q>) or if you want to
      orphan the package (<q>O</q>), please retitle the bug

      close the bug or retitle and reclassify it as RFP, as you see fit.</p>

	  <p>If you encounter problems with packaging the program (for example it
	  depends on another, not-yet-packaged program which you don't have
	  time to package), you might want to record these problems
      as additional information in the ITP, so that it is clear what's going on with

<p>If you feel that the developers' mailing list should know about your ITP,
RFA or anything else, add the header</p>
<pre>X-Debbugs-CC: debian-devel@lists.debian.org</pre>
<p>to the message (note: that's a real header, not a pseudo-header).</p>

<p>Of course, the easiest way of closing these bugs is to include an entry
in the package changelog saying what you've done and append
<tt>(closes:&nbsp;bug#nnnnn)</tt> to it. This way the bug will be closed
automatically after the new package gets installed into the archive.</p>

<p><strong>Attention:</strong> You can <strong>not</strong> reassign,
retitle, or set the owner of bug reports by mailing the report number
@bugs.debian.org,
<strong>nor</strong> by filing new reports. You have to send an appropriate
message to the BTS control bot &mdash; <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/server-control">
read the instructions for it</a>!</p>

<p>Note: If a package remains orphaned for a very long time, we will examine
the situation to determine if the package is needed anymore &mdash; if not,
the FTP maintainers will be asked to remove the package from unstable.</p>

<p>If for some reason you need to contact the WNPP maintainers, they can be
reached at <email wnpp@debian.org>.</p>
