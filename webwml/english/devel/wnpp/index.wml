<p>Work-Needing and Prospective Packages, WNPP for short, is a list 
of packages in need of new maintainers and prospective packages in Debian.
In order to closely track the real status of such things, WNPP is currently
operated as a pseudo-package in the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">Debian
Bug Tracking System (BTS)</a>.

entry in the BTS.

<hr>

<p>Since it uses the BTS, every developer is already familiar with the
technical details, such as submission of new information, modification of
information or closing of pending requests. On the other hand, in order to
achieve the highest level of automatization, some procedures have to be
observed.

<p>In order to submit new information, a bug has to be filed against the
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/wnpp">wnpp pseudo package</a> for each
(prospective) package that is affected. The format of the submission
should be like this:

<blockquote>
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org<br>
  Subject: {<i>TAG</i>}: {<b>package name</b>} -- {short package description}<br>
  <br>
  Package: wnpp<br>
  Severity: {see below}<br>
  <br>
  {Some information about the package.  If this is an ITP or RFP an URL
  where the package can be downloaded from is required, as well as
  information concerning its license.}
</blockquote>

<p>The tags to be used and their corresponding severities are:

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>O</b></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>normal</i></td>
  <td width="80%">The package has been `Orphaned'. It needs a new maintainer
      as soon as possible. If the package has a Priority higher or equal to
      standard, the severity should be set to important.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>RFA</b></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>normal</i></td>
  <td width="80%">This is a `Request for Adoption'. Due to lack of time,
      resources, interest or something similar, the current maintainer is
      asking for someone else to maintain this package. He/she will maintain
      it in the meantime, but perhaps not in the best possible way.
      In short: the package needs a new maintainer.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>ITP</b></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>wishlist</i></td>
  <td width="80%">This is an `Intent To Package'. Please submit a package
      description along with copyright and URL in such a report.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>RFP</b></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>wishlist</i></td>
  <td width="80%">This is a `Request For Package'. Someone has found an
      interesting piece of software and would like someone else to maintain
      it for Debian. Please submit a package description along with
      copyright and URL in such a report.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>W</b></td>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><i>wishlist</i></td>
  <td width="80%">The package has been `Withdrawn' and can be found in
      project/orphaned directory of Debian FTP site(s). Such reports should
      not be submitted directly, but instead should be a product of
      retitling and downgrading `O' reports.

<p>The procedures for closing this bugs are as follow:

<table border=0 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=3>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>O</b></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug
      to replace `O' with `ITA', in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted and to prevent its automatic removal from the
      archive. To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and close this bug once the package has been
      installed.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>RFA</b></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to adopt a package, retitle its bug
      to replace `RFA' with `ITA', in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted and to prevent its automatic removal from the
      archive. To actually adopt the package, upload it with your name in
      its Maintainer: field, and close this bug once the package has been
      installed.

      <p>If you as the package maintainer decide to orphan the package you
      marked with `RFA', please retitle the bug report and replace `RFA'
      with `O'. If you withdraw your request, please close the bug.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>ITP</b></td>
  <td width="90%">package the software, upload it and close this bug once
      the package has been installed.

      <p>If you change your mind, and no longer want to package this, either
      close the bug or retitle and reclasify it as RFP, as you see fit.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>RFP</b></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to package this, retitle the bug report
      to replace `RFP' with `ITP', in order for other people to know the
      program is already being packaged. Then package the software, upload
      it and close this bug once the package has been installed.
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td valign="top" width="10%"><b>W</b></td>
  <td width="90%">If you are going to reinstate the package, retitle the bug
      to replace `W' with `ITP', in order for other people to know the
      package is being adopted. To actually reinstate and adopt the package,
      upload a new version of it with your name in its Maintainer: field,
      and close this bug once the package has been installed.
  </td>
</tr>

<p>Of course, the easiest way of closing these bugs is to include an entry
in the package changelog saying what you've done and append
<tt>(closes:&nbsp;bug#nnnnn)</tt> to it. This way the bug will be closed
automatically after the new package gets installed into the archive.

<p><strong>Attention:</strong> you can <strong>not</strong> reassign or
retitle bug reports by mailing the report number @bugs.debian.org,
<strong>nor</strong> by filing new reports, you have to send an appropriate
message to the BTS control bot. <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/server-control">Read
the instructions for it!</a>

<p>Note: If a package remains orphaned for a very long time, we will examine
the situation to determine if the package is needed anymore &mdash; if not,
the FTP maintainers will be asked to move (withdraw) it to
<tt>project/orphaned</tt>. Checking for such packages is commonly done
before or during freezes.

<p>If for some reason you need to contact the WNPP maintainers, they can be
reached at <tt>wnpp@debian.org</tt>.
