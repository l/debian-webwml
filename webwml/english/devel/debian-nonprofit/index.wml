<h2>Debian-NP</h2>

<h3>Project description</h3>

<p>Debian-NP is the beginnings of an internal project to develop Debian into
an operating system that is designed to fulfill the requirements of small 
non-profit organizations. The goal of Debian-NP is a complete system for 
all common tasks that non-profit organization need using 100% free software. 
We want to provide this functionality in a integrated and documented 
stable free desktop environment.</p>

<p>The name Debian-NP includes NP meaning "non-profit." We've considered the name
Debian-NGO but feel as if NGOs are usually larger organizations than the ones we 
aim to serve. "Non-profit" is a somewhat US-centric term, but we have failed to 
come up with a better description of the community of not-for-profit, civil-society,
worker-owned, cooperative, activist groups that we think this distribution would
benefit. If you have a better idea for a name please let us hear it!</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the other Debian
sub-projects that include, in no particular order 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-lex/">Debian-Lex</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop/">Debian Desktop</a> and
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a>
<a href="http://www.demudi.org/">DeMuDi</a> projects.</p>

<p>Debian-NP will contain a set of meta packages that declare dependencies on other
Debian packages, and that way the complete system is prepared for solving particular
tasks. Like other sub-projects, we hope that there will soon be a framework for 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote/2003/debian-vote-200303/msg00014.html">
flavors of Debian</a> on which Debian-NP might be based.</p>

<p>Eventually, we aim to write new pieces of software, useful outside of Debian, to
replace programs important to non-profits but currently unavailable as free software
or on GNU/Linux systems (e.g., a good fund raising database).</p>

<h3>Project goals</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Build a solid software base for non-profit organizations with emphasis on easy
	    installation, easy maintenance, security, and the creation of a secure, integrated,
	    standard, all-in-one solution.</li>
	<li>Bring users and authors of a range of projects together.</li>
	<li>Provide information, documentation, and tutorials to help acclimate non-profits
            to GNU/Linux and the Debian-NP system.</li>
	<li>Help non-profit organizations share resources by allowing upstream authors to 
	    get their products packaged in Debian and distributed to others as part of the 
	    Debian-NP collection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>What can I do to help?</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Sign up on the mailing list and introduce yourself. Help design the subproject and
	    let your voice and your, or your organization's, needs be known.</li>
	<li>Tell others in the non-profit world, especially software developers with experience
	    in GNU/Linux and Debian, about the project. We need developers.</li>
	<li>Begin to enhancing and translating these web pages and information on 
	    the Debian-NP Wiki.</li>
	<li>Create a logo.</li>
	<li>Once we get up and going, we're going to need people to: 
		<ul>
		<li>Package existing software projects for Debian-NP.</li>
		<li>Build meta packages for different tasks.</li>
		<li>Create templates, etc., for existing packages to customize them for non-profits.</li>
		<li>Contribute or lead development efforts to build free, platform independent software 
		    to fulfill the specific needs of non-profits.</li>
		<li>Write documentation, translation, and internationalization.</li>
		<li>Build a live CD (perhaps based on Morphix, or Knoppix) to demo our distribution.</li>
		</ul>
    </li>
</ul>
