<h2>Debian-NP</h2>

<h3>Project description</h3>

<p>Debian-NP is an internal Debian project to develop Debian into
an operating system that is designed to fulfill the requirements of small 
non-profit organizations. The goal of Debian-NP is a complete system for 
all common tasks that non-profit organization need using 100% free software. 
We want to provide this functionality in an integrated and documented 
stable free desktop environment.</p>

<p>The name Debian-NP includes NP meaning "non-profit." We've considered the name
Debian-NGO but "non-profit" was the best  description of the community of
not-for-profit, civil-society, worker-owned, cooperative, and activist groups
that we think this distribution will benefit.</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the other Debian
Custom Distributions that include, in no particular order 
<a href="http://www.skolelinux.org/portal/">Skolelinux</a> build by the Debian-Edu project,
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-lex/">Debian-Lex</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop/">Debian Desktop</a> and
<a href="http://www.agnula.org/">DeMuDi/AGNULA</a>.</p>

<p>Debian-NP aims to create one or more <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/CustomDebian">Custom Debian
Distribution</a> (CDD) designed to fit the needs of
non-profits. Working within the Debian system, Debian-NP will select,
highlight, and document a subset of packages within Debian. In addition to
package selection, Debian-NP will customize packages in ways useful to
non-profits &mdash; all while working completely within the Debian system.</p>

<p>Eventually, many participants aim to write new pieces of software, useful
outside of Debian, to replace programs important to non-profits but currently
unavailable as free software or on GNU/Linux systems (e.g., a good fund raising
database).</p>

<p>Considering the diversity and the complexity of Non Profit organizations, we
also aim to be a base for further customizations, and we are helping develop
tools and documentation to allow non-profits to easily create their own Custom
Debian Distribution tailored to their specific needs.</p>
