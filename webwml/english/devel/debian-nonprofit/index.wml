<h2>Debian-NP</h2>

<h3>Project description</h3>

<p>Debian-NP is an internal Debian project to develop Debian into
an operating system that is designed to fulfill the requirements of small 
non-profit organizations. The goal of Debian-NP is a complete system for 
all common tasks that non-profit organization need using 100% free software. 
We want to provide this functionality in a integrated and documented 
stable free desktop environment.</p>

<p>The name Debian-NP includes NP meaning "non-profit." We've considered the name
Debian-NGO but "non-profit" was the best  description of the community of not-for-profit, civil-society,
worker-owned, cooperative, and activist groups that we think this distribution will
benefit.</p>

<p>The general idea for this kind of project was adopted from the other Debian
Custom Distributions that include, in no particular order 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-lex/">Debian-Lex</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">Debian Junior</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med/">Debian-Med</a>, 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop/">Debian Desktop</a> and
<a href="http://www.demudi.org/">DeMuDi/ANGULA</a> projects.</p>

<p>Debian-NP aims to create a <a
href="http://wiki.debian.net/index.cgi?CustomDebian">Custom Debian
Distribution</a> (CDD) designed to fit the needs of
non-profits. Working within the Debian system, Debian-NP will select,
highlight, and document a subset of packages within Debian. In
addition to package selection, Debian-NP will work to allow for
package customization in ways useful to non-profits to allow for the
creation of custom configured Debian packages &mdash; all while
working completely within the Debian system.</p>

<p>Eventually, many participants aim to write new pieces of software, useful outside of Debian, to
replace programs important to non-profits but currently unavailable as free software
or on GNU/Linux systems (e.g., a good fund raising database).</p>
