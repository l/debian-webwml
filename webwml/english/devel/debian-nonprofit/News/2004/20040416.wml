#use wml::debian::news

<p>Debian-NP participated in the focused "OS Tools and Materials"
mapping project in Amsterdam sponsored by <a
href="http://www.tacticaltech.org">Tactical Tech</a> where we worked
to map out existing NGO Projects to better understand who's already
out there and what they are they doing. Much of the sessions were
informal brainstorming about what existing projects were out there,
identifying those project's audience, content, format, goals and aims,
phases/future plans. This was then used to create an understanding of
the landscape of these projects, additionally resulted in this <a
href="http://debian-np.alioth.debian.org/resources/ngo_oss_res_mapping.pdf">diagram.</a></p>

<p>Following the projects mapping we had presentations and discussions
of participant's projects which are already running and where they
currently stand in their development process. This discussion was
designed to identify overlapping and possible collaboration between
these and other planned projects (see <a href="#appendix">Appendix:
Participant Projects</a>). We also had a discussion about developing
training curricula, the challenges, experiences and process
involved.</p>

<p>After identifying what is out there and where things are at we
focused on identifying what is still needed. We had focused and
directed discussion about what the projects we identified cover and
what may still be needed for NGOs. There was discussion about a
possible further project designed around reviewing software for
non-profits.</p>

<p>What is still needed to get NGOs and F/OSS together? We
brainstormed different aspects of this question, and came up with a
number of interesting results.</p>

<p>In discussing what is still needed there were a number of ideas,
among them: meetings for project coordinators; case material; a
"thinkpiece" on action research in NP/OSS area; a feedback framework
for use of OSS by NGOs (including evaluation and documentation);
connecting and coordinating disseminated networks; connecting social
elements to the OSS community and vice versa; recognizing and
celebrating excellence; a strong developers link to NGOs; a strong
understanding of what is necessary to link nonprofits, intermediaries,
and developers.</p>

<p>There was also a focused poster session on how non profit projects
can be made interesting for software developers.</p>

<p>Then there were first presentations of, followed by several
brainstormings about, various specific projects. The projects
presented were: FS/OS Software Localization and Recycled/refurbished
computers for ICT projects. Best possible preparation, project
promotion and distribution/dissemination were the central topics.</p>

<p>Software localization is a great opportunity for non-technical
people to get involved in the FS/OSS development. Localization is
also one of the biggest benefits Free/Open Source Software development
can bring to many different groups of people.</p>

<p>Bulgaria gives a good example: localization has become easy since the
Free Software Association has produced a number of guides and
dictionaries.</p>
  
<p>Useful in general would be a guide on how to structure translation
projects. It should contain evaluations /a documentation of outcomes
such as translation times related to manpower, sorted by translation
topics = text natures and difficulties.</p>

<p>Funding is necessary for setting up a first stable initial framework.
Sustainability is another important connected issue. Involve
resourceful partners, such as The Linux Documentation Project, FSF
Europe. One key issue is PR. Suggestion: collect localized Software
on a server, accessible to all interested groups.</p>

<p>Identifying which existing business models exist and have proved
worthwhile was also an exercise. The Istanbul workshop in February,
given by <a href="http://www.nesst.org">NESST</a> and organised by
TTC, will have "Business models for NGOs" as subject. Additionally,
the following successful NGO/F/OSS business models were identified:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.lpi.org">Linux Professional Institute</a>
       gives specific training including Linux certifications.</li>

  <li>Several Non-Profit Tech Organizations offering lots of valuable
       expertise in FS/OSS, business models and much more:  

       <ul><li><a href="http://wedgeweed.org">Wedgeweed</a>
	       (Appropriate Technology For Unions, Co-ops and Non-Profits)</li>

<h1> <a name="appendix">Appendix:</a> Participant Projects</h1>

<p>Micah Anderson presented the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-nonprofit/">Debian NP
project</a>, "...an integral Debian project to develop a customized
Debian into an operating system that is designed to fulfill the
requirements of small non-profit organizations. The goal of Debian-NP
is a complete system for all common tasks that non-profit
organizations need, using 100% free software.  We want to provide this
functionality in a integrated and documented stable free desktop
environment."</p>


<p>The Linux Curriculum project was represented by <a
href="http://wire.less.dk">Tomas Krag</a>, this
project "... aims at developing a framework and/or curriculum for
teaching Open Source software implementation for non-profit
organisations. The developed framework/curriculum will be used as a
guideline for facilitators at a series of planned Open Source events.
The goal of these sessions is to enable non-technical computer users
and technology implementors to become familiar with the tasks involved
in migrating a small office to Open Source software on the desktop as
well as the server."</p> 
 
<p>Mark Surman from the Common's Group discussed their <a
href="http://www.itrainonline.org/itrainonline/mmtk/opensource.shtml">project</a>,
the "Choosing Open Source Software" guide, "...developed with APC as a
part of their Multimedia Toolkit curriculum series. The series
includes modules on a number of topics including open source software
basics, selecting open source tools, open office, Internet radio
production, basic online search skills, etc. It also provides a module
format for curriculum development."</p>

<p>The <a href="http://openflows.org">Freeflows</a> project was
represented by Eric Goldhagen who spoke about their project to create
an "Internet server which advanced, but established open source
applications, modified to interact with one another seamlessly,
supporting advocacy and knowledge management, both internally and
externally. The emphasis of the project lies on the
integration/adaptation of existing OSS into a coherent package, not on
the development of new functionality."</p> 
 
<p>The <a href="http://www.lincproject.org">LINC</a> project (Low
Income Networking and Communication Project) was represented by Dirk
Slater who described their OS "Buyers guide", which helps identify the
most useful criteria for deciding which OS to use in your
organization. Additionally, the "Getting started guide," which is
using as a springboard existing case studies, pilot projects.</p>
 
<p><a href="http://www.i-space.org">Interspace Sofia</a> from Bulgaria
was represented by Kaladan (Vladimir Petkov) which is a unique
combination of several different Open Source projects all in 'one' =
combined. http://www.i-space.org.</p> 
 
<p>And finally, the <a href="http://www.tacticaltech.org">Tactical
Technology Collective</a> which aims to foster social technology in
developing and transition countries with the help of a number of
"Source" events. Among these events: Africa Source in Namibia, a
FS/OSS developers workshop, a small FS/OSS meeting in Porto Alegre,
Brazil in June and a Tech Activists Camp - location still to be
decided.</p>
