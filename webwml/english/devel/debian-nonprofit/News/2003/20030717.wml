<p>Debian-Nonprofit was represented at this years' annual Debian
conference, <a href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf3/">Debconf3</a>,
and the more loosely organized preceding <a
href="http://www.debconf.org/debconf3/debcamp.php">"Debcamp"</a> by
Benjamin Mako Hill, Enrico Zini, and others.</p>

<p>On the last day of Debcamp, Debian-NP helped coordinate a BOF
meeting for developers involved in custom distributions, subprojects,
metadistros, and flavors within Debian. The meeting was attended by
developers involved with the more familiar custom Debian distributions
as well representatives of <a
href="http://www.skolelinux.no">Skolelinux</a> and <a
href="http://metadistros.hispalinux.es/">Metadistros</a></p>

<p>The meeting ended with two major conclusions:</p>

<ol>

  <li>They agreed as a group to try and reduce the confusion around
the terms subprojects, subdistros, flavors, and others by referring to
their projects as <i>Custom Debian Distributions</i>. The group felt
that this term acted to contrast custom distributions aiming to
create customized versions of Debian with other types of subprojects
like the technical committee and the IPv6 team. They also felt that
the term reinforced the fact that these projects aim to work fully
within the Debian system rather than to branch from it or to focus on
one part.</li>

  <li>They agreed to try to put effort into increasing the amount of
communication between custom distributions. Since it is currently
unclear if creating a mailing list for custom distribution discussion
is necessary, the group decided to report to each other and the
project on the whole through <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/">debian-devel-announce</a>
and to carry on custom distribution related discussions on <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel">debian-devel</a> prefixing
their messages with <tt>[custom]</tt> in the tradition of <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-desktop">Debian-Desktop</a>.</li>
       
</ol>
