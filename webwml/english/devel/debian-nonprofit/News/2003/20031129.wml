<p>In preparation for the <a href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/">World
Summit on the Information Society</a> conference in Geneva, the
Debian-NP project has completed work and a Bootable Debian Preview
CD. The CD is the first released version of Debian-NP in any form.</p>

<p>The CD is a "Live CD" like the well known <a
href="http://www.knoppix.net/">Knoppix.</a> Users of this CD can try
Debian-NP without installing it their hard drives. When users are
comfortable with the software, they have the option of installing the
CD to their hard drives. Debian-NP is built using code form <a
href="http://morphix.sourceforge.net/">Morphix</a> &mdash; a
derivative of Knoppix designed to be more modular. Morphix's primary
author, Alex de Langraf, has been a long-time Debian-NP
participant.</p>
 
<p>The first version of the CD &mdash; version 0.1 &mdash; released on
November 28 contained a release critical bug that was fixed in
version 0.1r2 released a day later on November 29th.</p>

<p>Designed for distribution on physical media, the CD cover will
contain the following extra information:</p>

<blockquote><p><tt>To change the keyboard layout (and in some cases the language)
Please enter the following at the boot prompt: "morphix lang=XX" where
XX can be any of the following options:
bg, be, ch, cn, cs, cz, da, de, dk, es, fi, fr, it, ja, nl, pl, ru,
sk, tr, tw, uk, us</tt></p></blockquote>

<p>The 557 megabyte CD image is available for download at first link
