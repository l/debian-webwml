<h2>World Summit on the Information Society</h2>

<p>With Debian-NP participants including Benjamin Mako Hill in
attendance, Debian-Nonprofit had an important presence at the <a
href="http://www.itu.int/wsis/">World Summit on the Information
Society</a> held in Geneva, Switzerland between December 10th and 12th
2004 and the preceding week.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lpi.org/">Linux Professional Institute</a>
(LPI) coordinated the production of 3,000 Debian-NP Bootable GNU/Linux
Distributions. The production of the Debian-NP CDs was generously
funded by <a href="http://www.hp.com/">Hewlett-Packard</a>. LPI's
numerous delegates handed out thousands of Debian-NP CDs to attendees
of the conference from all over the world and from governments, civil
society, and the private sector.</p>

<p>Additionally, Debian-NP participant Benjamin Mako Hill attended the
WSIS as a delegate of <a href="http://www.cpsr.org">Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility</a> primarily as a
representative of Debian-NP. As a delegate, Hill had access to a wide
array of civil society, NGO, nonprofit, and governmental groups and
was able to discuss, present, and explain Debian-NP.</p>

<h2>WSIS? We Seize! Counter/Co-Conference</h2>

<p>Running concurrently with the WSIS was the <a
href="http://www.geneva03.org">WSIS? We Seize!</a> conference
organized by the Geneva03 collective. The conference catered to a
diverse group of free software advocates and developers, intellectual
property researchers and activists, independent and tactical media
makers, technologists, members of small non-profit organizations, and
others.</p>

<p>The conference hosted a CD release party for Debian-NP with a short
talk and discussion period. Additionally, Benjamin Mako Hill gave a
workshop on making Custom Bootable CDs using Morphix that described
and presented the production of the Debian-NP bootable CD.</p>
