<p>Benjamin Mako Hill and Micah Anderson sent <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/debian-devel-announce-200307/msg00002.html">a
message</a> to the <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/">debian-devel-announce
mailing list</a> alerting developers to a potential Debian custom
distribution designed for desktop use in non-profit organizations. The
message, phrased as a "pre-announcement," was designed to poll the
interest for such a distribution&mdash;especially from potential
developers who might want to work on the project.</p>

<p>The announcement text read:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Over the last few years, we've dealt extensively with small
non-profit organizations engaged in grassroots organizing,
technological assistance, independent media, and educational work in a
variety of areas.</p>

<p>We see non-profits as a particularly important area to launch a
subproject because many of these non-profits are already familiar with
free and open source software, philosophies and development
methodologies. If they are large and technically involved enough to
need their own server, they probably already use GNU/Linux. However in
day-to-day operations most use proprietary operating systems. Unlike
many groups of users where advocacy is an uphill battle, many
non-profits <em>want</em> to use GNU/Linux on their workstations but are
waiting for someone to "make it easy for them." We want to do just
this.</p>

<p>By putting together a sub-distribution that fulfills the needs of
non-profits and pitching it as a solution <em>for them</em>, we hope to get
many small organizations interested in the project.</p>

<p>Most of these groups use their workstations for a limited and
predictable set of tasks that include many areas of overlap with other
sub-projects (word processing, book-keeping, email, maintaining
contacts) plus other more specialized uses (fund raising, developing
membership lists).</p>

<p>With this project, we aim to create an easily installable customized
Debian distribution with the needs of small non-profits in mind. In
the future, we'd also like to develop several new applications geared
to replace programs many non-profits use that are only available on
proprietary operating systems.</p>
