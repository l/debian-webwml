#use wml::debian::template title="HOWTO request a mailing list"

<P>The scope of this document is to help people establish a mailing
list at lists.debian.org.  The intention of this document is to
decrease the workload for the listmasters and to decrease annoying
discussions and superflous requests for stuff that is still missing.

<P>New lists will only be created if a (wishlist) bug report against
lists.debian.org exists and the required information is provided in
the bug report.

<P>The following information is required if you want to establish a
new list:

<OL>
	<LI>Name

   	<P>Which list do you want to be created?  Please note that every
   	list is prefixed by a unique string:
	
	<UL>
   		<LI>Debian                            debian-
   		<LI>Software in the Public Interest   spi-
   		<LI>Berlin                            berlin-
   		<LI>Linux Documentation Project       ldp-
   		<LI>Linux Standard Base               lsb-
	</UL>
   	<P>The listmasters will add this string if required.

   	<P>Please keep the name descriptive, short and unique.  Subnames
   	are divided by a dash `-'.

   	<P>If the name is not proper the listmasters will reject the
   	request.

   	<LI>Rationale

    <P>Why do you want this list be created, why is it important or
    similar.  Vanity lists (like debian-jokes etc.) will not be
    created.  Do not waste your (and our) time.

    <P>We will reserve the right to ask for consensus on debian-devel
    and / or debian-project first.  To speed it up you should do
    this for questionable lists.

   	<LI>Long description

    	<P><A HREF="../MailingLists/subscribe">

      	proper list to join.  The description refers to the part of

      	list.

   <LI>Category

      	<P>This is needed to classify the list and to properly sort it on
