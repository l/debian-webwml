#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Jr. Hatrack"

This page contains a collection of "hats" worn by the Debian Jr.
contributors.  It is intended to give new members of the group ideas
about where they might fit in.  If you think you'd do well wearing one
of these hats, give us a shout and we'll arrange a fitting. :)

<i><b>[</b> editor's note: not ready to put on the Debian Jr. site yet. Roles
  need to be clearly defined.  Where more than one person is required
  this should be indicated. Roles which are already filled should
  be indicated, linking to the person on "People" in that role.  Roles
  "up for adoption" should be indicated. <b>]</b></i>
