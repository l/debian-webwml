Unfortunately it looks like this will forever be non-free, the license
is really ugly.  The kids all love it, and there's nothing like it in
main.  We have finally decided to ditch this due to non-freeness and the
ethical issues surrounding use of proprietary roms.  Besides, there are
so many new free arcade-style games now that we hardly miss it.

This displays a globe with placenames in your root window.  The children
have fun making <b>oneko</b> walk all over the world.  By default, the
globe turns once every five minutes so eventually you see the whole
world.  There are command line options to change this and other
parameters, but if the Debian menu is used to start xearth, there is no
opportunity to deviate from the defaults.  It would be nice for this and
other toys started from the menu to have a popup for the toy that allows
you to select different settings before it starts.
