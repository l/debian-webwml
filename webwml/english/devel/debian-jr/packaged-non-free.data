Unfortunately it looks like this will forever be non-free, the license
is really ugly.  The kids all love it, and there's nothing like it in
main.  We have finally decided to ditch this due to non-freeness and the
ethical issues surrounding use of proprietary roms.  Besides, there are
so many new free arcade-style games now that we hardly miss it.
