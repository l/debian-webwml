<p>
It has been a while since I've reported on how Debian Jr. is going.  Yes,
we're still here and still forging ahead.  A number of improvements
have been made to the Debian Jr. web site to give people a better
idea of what we've accomplished, and where we are headed.  So please
have a look:

Here are the important developments over the past year:
<ul>
<li>Most of our energy today is focused on ensuring Debian Jr. packages
  are all at least in a releasable state for Woody.  We help to
  deal with bugs against packages we list, or find suitable
  replacement packages if the ones we have chosen cannot be
  made ready for release.
<li>We have completed a good base set of 'junior-' meta packages
  for Debian Jr. users.  The task-junior package is now obsolete,
  replaced by the new tasksel entry which is functionally equivalent.
  Selecting "Debian Jr." in tasksel will populate your system with
  most of the packages in Debian Jr.  The rest can be obtained by
  individually installing those 'junior-' packages that are not
  installed by tasksel.  See the junior-doc package for details.
  The "quick guide" in this package covers installation.
<li>The logo page has been updated.  It is linked from our home page,
  listed above.  I honestly cannot say if we're any closer to deciding
  on one at this point.  (Logo selection is fairly low priority
  compared to getting things ready for release.)
<li>While continuing to look for someone to form a separate debian-edu
  group, it has become fairly clear that since nobody has stepped
  forward to do this yet, Debian Jr. will need to cover some aspects
  of Debian in education.  We have therefore taken membership in the
  newly formed <a href="http://www.schoolforge.net/">Schoolforge</a>
  coalition, a group of "independent organisations that advocate,
  use and develop open resources for primary and secondary
  education".  Over the coming year, we'll be on the lookout for
  developers who would like to see Debian used in the schools and
  find work for them in Debian Jr.
<li>The child-oriented menus design discussion, as interesting as it was
  at the time, fizzled, producing nothing.  I blame first my own lack
  of interest in carrying the implementation forward.  Second, it seems
  the principal work, that of simply packaging free children's software
  for Debian, and ensuring it is all release ready, consumes all
  of our energies for now.
<li><a href="http://www.osef.org/">OSEF</a>, the Open Source
  Education Foundation, has kindly donated a vintage laptop (K6-233,
  810M drive) to the Debian Jr. project.  It is en route to my
  house as I write this.  We are grateful for the donation which
  will be immediately put to use as a Debian Jr. system in my
  household.  It will be kept up-to-date with sid and will be
  valuable in identifying strengths and weaknesses of our packages on
  such older hardware.
