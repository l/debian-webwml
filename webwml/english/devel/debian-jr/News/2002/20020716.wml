<define-tag pagetitle>Debian Jr. -- How are we doing?</define-tag>
<define-tag release_date>2002-07-16</define-tag>
#use wml::debian::news
<p>
We have established a <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianJr">page</a>
at <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/FrontPage">DebianWiki</a> as a
space where users and developers can collaborate on documentation. 
Beyond merely <a href="http://wiki.debian.net/JuniorPackages">listing
packages</a> here, the site documents why Debian Jr.
has chosen to include each package, and what particular
features or mis-features they may have for children.  The community
of developers and users is encouraged to make requests for including
new packages in Debian Jr. here, cross-referencing them to RFP or ITP bug
numbers in the bug database at bugs.debian.org as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
So, teetering on the brink of the release of Woody, how are we doing
with Debian Jr. anyway?  Let's have a look at our goals:
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Making Debian desirable to children</dt>
<dd>The proof of the pudding is in the eating, as they say.  Are the
children in your life using Debian?  If so, what do they like about it? 
What don't they like about it?
</dd>
<dt>Working with other child-oriented free software projects</dt>
<dd>Recently, I officially became liaison between <a
href="http://www.tux4kids.org">Tux4Kids</a> and Debian Jr.  The
<a href="http://www.newbreedsoftware.com/tuxpaint/">TuxPaint</a> package
is the first new Tux4Kids sponsored package to be added to our project
since that relationship was formalized.  We look forward to more
great software from Tux4Kids.
</dd>
<dt>Applications</dt>
<dd>I think we have done well to give broad coverage over a number
of categories.  If you feel there are still holes, please
<a href="http://wiki.debian.net/JuniorRequestToInclude">submit
requests</a> to fill them in.
</dd>
<dt>Childproofing and account management</dt>
<dd>We haven't produced anything here yet.  However, we are working
behind the scenes with the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-med">debian-med</a> project
on the foundations for this.  The basic idea is that all subproject
users (whether med, junior, or some other similar Debian subproject)
should belong to an appropriate Unix group.  This allows certain account
features to be implemented for all members of the group.  The first of
these will be subproject menus.
<dd>
</dd>
<dt>Learning to use the computer</dt>
<dd>This has been addressed up until now merely by seeking for
and including packages which support learning about the computer, such
as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/gcompris">Gcompris</a>, which
teaches small children how to use the mouse and keyboard as well as
other basic skills.  There is certainly room for improvement here. 
Perhaps we could record some ideas at our new <a
href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianJr">Wiki site</a>.
</dd>
<dt>User interface</dt>
<dd>Although you haven't seen active discussion on the list, I have
been working with Andreas Tille of debian-med on this.  You can expect
some actual code before the summer is out.
</dd>
<dt>Family guidance</dt>
<dd>Another possible topic for the new <a
href="http://wiki.debian.net/DebianJr">Wiki</a> which hasn't really
been given any attention.
</dd>
<dt>Children's System</dt>
<dd>I have heard from time to time users share with me on irc and
elsewhere that they are setting up systems specifically for their
children.  If you have a story to share, we want to hear it and learn
from your experience.
</dd>
<dt>Ports</dt>
<dd>I think we have our hands full enough with material either already
in Debian or that can be readily packaged for Debian.  Still, if there
is a particular applications which you feel needs to be ported to Linux
and you have the time and energy to petition for a port, go for it.
</dd>
<dt>Internationalization</dt>
<dd>The Debian Jr. web site itself (at least the front page) has now
been translated into six languages.  Also, the number of
applications with alternate languages supported is on the rise. 
However, nobody has made an effort to focus on Debian Jr.
applications in particular.  If that sort of work interests you, we'd
like to hear from you.
</dd>
<dt>Marketing & PR</dt>
<dd>Andreas Tille has been a spokesperson for the Debian Jr. project
at some recent speaking engagements where he gave talks about his own
new project, Debian Med, which is patterned after Debian Jr.  We
appreciate his continued efforts to spread the word, as well as the
work he is doing with Debian Jr. on a common infrastructure for both
Debian Jr. and Debian Med.
