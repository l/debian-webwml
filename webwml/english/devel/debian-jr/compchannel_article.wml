<H2>A Linux for the Young</H2>

<P>
<i>The free operating system Linux should gain
entry into children's rooms - that is what certainly the initiators of
three projects wish. But whether Linux fits that simply into "children's
shoes" in the minds of the committed developers is 
questionable.</i>

      "Daddy, is this Linux game also available for Windows 95 -- it
would look better there, wouldn't it?", nine-year-old Victoria asked
her father nervously.  That hurt the Debian developer Ben Armstrong in two
ways: as a committed advocate of the Open Source idea he is one of the
initiators of the "Debian Jr. Project" which aims to make the Linux based
Debian operating system more friendly for kids.  Besides, he wants to pass
on his beliefs of "free software for all" to his children because he
classifies the alternatives as "too restrictive and just
unacceptable". "Whether I like it or not, Windows is much easier for kids
than Linux is" Armstrong had to admit. "Why can't Linux be more fun for
kids?  I want to develop a desktop for kids where they can start toys,
games and educational software with a few mouseclicks"
describes Armstrong in his vision of the Debian Jr. Project.
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The project is not visible to the public yet and is
situated in the "internal phase" in which Armstrong exchanges ideas and
tips with other Debian developers in his spare time about how Linux-based
desktop-functions and applications which are suitable for children could look
in a <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-jr/">mailing list</a>
{translator's note: this is not true anymore: there is
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-jr/">an official
website</a>}. "This is not about reinventing a user interface but about
selecting applications we think children can cope with best." says
Armstrong.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The central question is: "What exactly is it
that makes computers attractive to kids?". Therefore you must keep your
eyes and ears open and look unobtrusively over the kids' shoulders when
they sit at the computer.
Without this focus you get lost in abstract questions believes the
Debian developer.  Not only is desktop-arrangement debated, but also
child-proofing applications so that kids are not limited, but 
rather are encouraged to find their own solutions - "even if it 
breaks sometimes".
</P>

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the Debian Jr. Project there are two more
developer initiatives which want to enthuse kids to use Linux playfully,
an operating system which is hard for many average users to understand. 
One of them is "Linux for Kids" which launched 
their own <a href="http://www.linuxforkids.com">website</a>.
It wants to give publicity to the open operating system as a platform 
for learning and edutainment software. "Our target group is kids under 
the age of ten" says Chris Ellec, the operator of the website. But so 
far, Linux for Kids serves mainly as a software forum for parents and 
teachers who are looking for programs for the young at home or for
teaching. "We hope that we become also a contact point for kids soon"
says Ellec.

<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Ellec and some friends wanted to adapt 
some old 486es for deployment in an elementary school. Through his long 
lasting
experience with Linux he installed the free operating system on the
"good old boxes". But then he discovered that there were barely any
educational programs and games. So he collected existing software from
the net and encouraged some programmer friends to develop appropriate 
applications.  Thus, step by step the software forum grew from five
up to more than 60 programs.  Under seven categories, games like 
"Tuxracer", a 3D ski race, city simulation "Lincity", a multilanguage
translator for Japanese and educational programs can be downloaded. In 
February a collection of the best
programs on CD-ROM came out, the proceeds of which go towards
operation of the site.  A review system and feedback from users should 
be added soon. The
initiators or "Linux for Kids" work closely together with
<a href="http://www.seul.org/edu/">SEUL/Edu (Simple End User
Linux)</a> a discussion group of parents, teachers and students who want
to deploy Linux as a learning aid.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Linux-mascot Tux has already become a cuddly 
toy for children's rooms - now it just has to manage the jump to the
child's computer desktop.
