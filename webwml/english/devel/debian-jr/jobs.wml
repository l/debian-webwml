#use wml::debian::template title="Debian Jr. Jobs"

This page contains a list of Debian Jr. jobs.  It is intended to answer
the question "what can I do to help?"

<H3>Package maintainer</H3>

Debian developers or prospective developers are encouraged to
find packages to add to Debian Jr. and maintain them.

<H3>Package reviewer</H3>

Even if you're not a developer, you can always find new packages
(either in Debian or not) and try them, especially if you can get
some children to try them with you.  Then send us your comments
so we can decide if it is worth adding to Debian Jr.

<H3>Mentor</H3>

We could make do with some fresh blood.  Veteran Debian developers
can help by becoming sponsors for a new maintainers who would like
to package things for Debian Jr.

<H3>Project leader</H3>

That would be <a href="mailto:synrg@debian.org">the guy</a> who
conceived this project in the first place, who sets the direction of the
project, keeps it going, and does the jobs nobody else wants.

<H3>Webmaster</H3>

A Debian developer with CVS write access who looks after our web
site.  Since the project leader has supplied virtually all of the
content so far, he is content to hold onto this job for the
foreseeable future.  However, if you want to help by submitting
corrections or suggestions for the site, feel free to do so.

<H3>Logo &amp; Artwork contributor</H3>

Although there has been some discussion, and some submissions for
consideration, we haven't yet chosen a logo, nor settled on artwork for
the website nor for Debian Jr. desktop themes.  Those would be nice
things to have.

<H3>Documentor</H3>

This ranges from writing missing man pages for Debian Jr. apps that need
them and filing them as bugs/patches against the appropraite packages,
to writing HOWTOs and the like for the junior-doc package.

<H3>QA representative</H3>

Everyone working with Debian Jr. should of course be concerned about the
quality of their work, but it would be nice to have someone (or a few
someones) to take care of those mundane but necessary QA jobs like
taking a pass through all the Debian Jr. packages and keeping potential
problems in check (like discovering a broken package is no longer being
maintained and following up on it).

<H3>Web site translator</H3>

While not a Debian Jr. job in particular, we have been approached by 
people who want to help with translating our web site into
their own languages.  We direct them <a 
href="$(HOME)/devel/website/translating">here</a>.

<H3>Package internationalization coordinator</H3>

Both the applications themselves and the descriptions of the 
applications are being translated into different languages throughout
Debian.  You can find out about how to be a part of those
efforts <a href="$(HOME)/international/">here</a>.

<H3>Schools &amp; Education sub-project leader</H3>

Many people have asked about this but nobody so far has stepped to the
plate.  The role isn't really well defined at this point, as it will
likely be determined by whoever actually takes the job.
