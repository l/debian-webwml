A favourite for my 5 and ups.  But "2 sided" puzzles are confusing for the
young children.  I'd like to be able to save as a default config for the
children the "-side 2" switch to force all of the pieces to be flipped
over to side 2 at the beginning so they don't have to manually flip them
over.  Also, I'd like to be able to disable the middle-mouse-button
mapping to flip pieces, as they sometimes accidentally hit it, much to
their puzzlement (no pun intended) and frustration.

A bit complex for the 5yo, and even the older ones, but they all do have
fun with it.

<NAME>xpaint</NAME>
<DESC>
Not quite as complex as the gimp, but a bit clunky in the GUI and not
nearly as dazzling effects.

A classic, loved by the whole family
(J, only 2, loves the sounds and bright colors while others play :)

Fortune could be polished to display only jokes which children would like
more than general ones.

Polishing could be done by setting game parameters and maybe we could give
a slight hint in the docs on how to become a millionaire ;-).

No, this is not a joke.  Why not start them out with the "ultimate"
editor?
