<NAME>ssystem</NAME>
<DESC>
A solar system and celestial body viewer, Ssystem uses OpenGL models
of the planets and various other objects.  A 3d video card is
recommended, but it is quite useable (at ~3fps) on my P133 machine.
The interface is a bit difficult and confusing.

<NAME>mathwar</NAME>
<DESC>
This is a math flashcard game.  If you take too long the computer
will "guess", at which point you choose whether the computer is
right or wrong.  This twist makes the game more engaging than a
simple flash-card drill.

<GROUP>Education - Typing</GROUP>

<NAME>gtypist</NAME>
<DESC>
The young children in our household (eldest, 10) find gtypist a bit
dull.  It is more suited for older children or adults.
<p>
The gtypist package is the new version of typist.  It has been renamed
since it has now become "GNU typist".
</DESC>

<NAME>tipptrainer</NAME>
<DESC>
A touch-typing program which may have more appeal to children than
gtypist.
</DESC>

<NAME>tuxtype</NAME>
<DESC>
Educational typing tutor game starring Tux.  The children enjoy using
this game to learn how to type.  It has funny sound effects and graphics
that keep their attention.  It doesn't really teach touch-typing,
though.
</DESC>

<NAME>typespeed</NAME>

<NAME>bumprace</NAME>

A bouncy maze with nice sound effects and graphics.  Challenging at the

</DESC>

<NAME>circuslinux</NAME>
<DESC>
A clown is fired out of a cannon onto a teeter-totter which you control
to bounce a second clown up into the air to pop balloons under a big-top
circus tent.  The game is funny and had my children in fits of giggles.
</DESC>

<NAME>defendguin</NAME>
<DESC>
A "Defender" clone wherein you guide the hero through a 2D scrolling
world defending it from the onslaught of the alien enemy who tries to
steal the inhabitants and turn them into "mutants" when they reach the
top of the screen.  The added twist that distinguishes this from the
original is the "Linux vs. Bill as Borg" theme.  Bill/Borg aliens turn
the "penguinoids" into minions of Bill.
</DESC>

<NAME>gemdropx</NAME>
<DESC>
Related to "tetris" but decidedly not a tetris clone, in this game you
need to think quickly matching up gems and removing them before the
playing area fills up.
</DESC>

<NAME>heroes</NAME>
<DESC>
Spectacular graphics and sound.  A 2D "tron" type game with lots of
powerups and special effects.
</DESC>

<NAME>lbreakout</NAME>
<DESC>
A newer "pong" game.  It is a bit more difficult for children than
xboing because you cannot adjust the speed.  A milder expletive is used
at the end of the game ("damn").  We haven't bothered trying to fix
this, as it is not quite as obvious or frequent as in xboing.
Furthermore, it appears a source-code change would be required to make
the fix.  We have worked around the problem by suggesting creative
mis-hearings of the word (we have offered "dead", "jam", "jammin'",
"toe-jam" :)
</DESC>

<NAME>luxman</NAME>
<DESC>
A classic, loved by the whole family.
(J, only 2, loves the sounds and bright colors while others play :)
In our opinion, the best "Pacman" clone.  However, it has the
disadvantages that come with being a svgalib program.  That is, it
cannot be played in X, and is a security risk, since it must run
as root (or suid root).
</DESC>

<NAME>madbomber</NAME>
<DESC>
Catch bombs in a tub full of water to snuff them out as the "mad bomber"
zips back and forth, dropping them from atop a wall.

Free Lemmings(tm) clone
</DESC>

<NAME>thrust</NAME>
<DESC>
This is a clone of an old Commodore 64 game where you pilot a space
ship, blow things up, and try to retrieve a weight.  I don't have any
kids, but I enjoy it.  The package contains both svgalib and x binaries.
</DESC>

<NAME>xboing</NAME>
<DESC>
An excellent "pong" type game.  Parents may not appreciate the expletive
("aw shit") used when a ball is lost.  However, this can be easily
fixed /usr/lib/games/xboing/sounds by copying "Doh1.au" on top of
"balllost.au".
</DESC>

<NAME>xsoldier</NAME>
<DESC>
XSoldier is a very fast 2-D shoot-em-up game similar to Galaxians and
other space games.
<P>
The down-sides are:
<OL>
<LI>It can be more memory-hungry than other games. The response is
sluggish under 16M of memory.
<LI>It requires 1024 X 768 to fit on the screen.
</OL>
Aside from those two drawbacks, it is a fast-paced, engaging and
enjoyable game for many age groups. My 11 Year old Daughter has great
fun playing it, when she can get me away from it : )
</DESC>

<GROUP>Games - Arcade - 3D</GROUP>

<NAME>armagetron</NAME>
<DESC>
You need a good 3D accelerated graphics card for this one.  The controls
are fairly easy to work, but the game is a bit shy on help.  Compared to
gltron, this one is a bit easier to control.  Networked play is also
possible, though with only one system in the house with a decent 3D
card I haven't tried it yet.
</DESC>

<NAME>gltron</NAME>
<DESC>
Another 3D tron game requiring acceleration.  The crashes are a bit more
interesting than armagetron and the sound effects appeal to the
children.
</DESC>

<NAME>tuxracer</NAME>
<DESC>
Our children's favourite 3D accelerated game.  Tux zooms down an icy
mountain race course gobbling up herring.  Sometimes he gets stuck,
which is a bit frustrating.  The "practice" mode is what the children
prefer to use.
</DESC>

<NAME>xblast</NAME>
<DESC>
Children probably need parental help to set up a match on a network.
With a network of old 486s and the parents' K6-2's, this game provides
some nice family networked fun.  Based on the classic "bomberman" game,
there are virtually limitless levels.  The neighbor kids have nothing
like this at home (possibly because they don't have a house full of
old PCs :)

<NAME>lmemory</NAME>
<DESC>
Classic "memory" card-matching game.  Suitable for younger children.
</DESC>

<NAME>rocks-n-diamonds</NAME>
<DESC>
Like Boulderdash, this is a 2D scrolling puzzle game in which you guide
the hero with simple directional controls through one of seemingly
countless numbers of levels.  The hero must avoid falling rocks and
other hazards and collect enough diamonds or meet some other
objective to open the exit and escape before the time runs out.
Children must use logic to work through a number of perplexing
situations in each level to guide the hero safely to the end of the
level.  Being able to start at any level helps keep frustration in
check, as a difficult level can be simply left until later and a
different level chosen at any time. The integrated level editor is lots
of fun and relatively easy to use (although designing good levels can be
tricky for a child).  The children love to play with the level editor as
well as play with the game.

<NAME>xjig</NAME>
<DESC>
A favourite for my 5 and ups.  But "2 sided" puzzles are confusing for the
young children.  I'd like to be able to save as a default config for the
children the "-side 2" switch to force all of the pieces to be flipped
over to side 2 at the beginning so they don't have to manually flip them
over.  Also, I'd like to be able to disable the middle-mouse-button
mapping to flip pieces, as they sometimes accidentally hit it, much to
their puzzlement (no pun intended) and frustration.  A gui-based puzzle
launcher that allows the child to point-and-click to choose the puzzle
image and size would be great.

<NAME>penguineyes</NAME>

This is an xeyes-like desktop toy which supports a number of fun themes
including Linus, Tux, Dust Puppy and a GNU.  In addition to resizing,
you can flip the character with movable eyes upside-down or
left-to-right, or put it in "guilty/paranoid" mode in which the
character always looks away from the pointer instead of towards it.
</DESC>

<NAME>xbase-clients</NAME>

The <b>xeyes</b> toy is included in this package.  Even the very
youngest children (aged 1 or 2) will appreciate this classic interactive
desktop toy.  With some parental help, eyes can be resized by clicking
and dragging.  Whole armies of eyes can be created which will all
obediently follow the pointer as the child moves the mouse.

<NAME>xfireworks</NAME>

Displays fireworks (as in the familiar <b>xscreensaver</b> hack) on
your root window.  Unfortunately, there is no "stop xfireworks" at

teach the children how to use <b>killall</b>. Also, the fireworks "eat"
the image behind it, much as <b>xhangglider</b> does.

In addition to using the screensaver hacks as screensavers, they can
be started with various command line options as toys for your

hacks may be more successfully run in their own window than in the
root window because they take less CPU to refresh.  Use the -demo
option to try out different screensavers.

<NAME>bplay</NAME>

When the eldest children were very small and my most powerful system was
a P100, we downloaded some wav sound-bytes from the net and made
appropriately named commands for bplay to play each of them.  They could
then use the VT-420 terminal in the livingroom to play these from bash.
They learned how to play several in a row using semicolons between them.
They also learned to use tab command-completion to help view and select
the right one.  The youngest, then aged three, could simply press
up-arrow and enter to play them over and over again until the parents
had enough. :)
</DESC>

<NAME>cdtool</NAME>
<DESC>
The children have a number of their own CDs and can use the simple
commands "cdplay" and "cdstop" to start and stop playing.  Although a
number of gui-based players exist, it just seems simpler to use this
tool.
</DESC>

<NAME>grip</NAME>
<DESC>
Grip is a rather easy to use, once set up, ripper and CD player.
Copying your children's favourite CDs to your hard drive can make it
much easier for them to select and play their own music.
<P>
Use the patent-free, open-source ogg-vorbis for encoding.  Grip
supports ogg as well as the patent-encumbered mp3 format.  It refers
in the menus everywhere to mp3, but if you look closely, oggenc is
one of the possible encoders.  Remember to change the output file
extension from mp3 to ogg.
</DESC>

<NAME>timidity</NAME>
<DESC>
Timidity++ is basically a command-line based MIDI file player that will
give you a new respect for the MIDI format.  Rather than use the
built-in instruments of your sound card, which can sound rather poor,
Timidity++ uses software-based instrument patches which sound extremely
good.  Timidity++ by itself has no instrument patches but 
timidity-patches will provide them. Timidity++ does not depend on 
Timidity-patches because you can use many different patches available
free and for a price from various sources.  Playing a MIDI file with
Timidity++ and the Timidity-patches will sound very like the real thing! 
You will never what to use the built-in instruments of your sound card
again!  Timidity++ also has a few different GUI's available, but these
need to be compiled in. They are based on gtk+, motif or lesstif, even
an ncurses interface can be compiled in. I've played with a few of these
and find the gtk+ GUI to be quite easy to use, although it does generate
a few errors, I've never had it crash or hang on me. And I have used it
quite a bit. You would need to try the different interfaces and see
which would be best for the Debian JR project.

<NAME>xmms</NAME>

XMMS is for Linux what WinAmp is for Windows and a whole lot more!
<P>
Starting out as just a WinAmp clone for Linux, XMMS initially provides
the exact same functionality for playing compressed audio files.  It has
a playlist and equaliser as well as being skinable.  Thanks to the
modular nature of Linux, Lots of different input, process and output
modules are available for XMMS to expand its usability.  It even has an
OpenGL 3D spectrum analyser display available, but be warned!!!  This is
memory hungry without a great 3D graphics card to share the load.
<P>
Again, like grip, although originally intended for the patent-encumbered
mp3 format, xmms can be used with the patent-free ogg format which is
what we recommend.

<NAME>fvwm</NAME>
<DESC>
A simple, lightweight window manager.  The fvwm buttons allow
easy single-click access to applications for the very young.  At
the same time it is powerful and configurable so it scales well
as the child matures.  There are more modern window managers available
with prettier features, but that usually comes at the expense of
bloating the window manager.
</DESC>

<NAME>wmaker</NAME>
<DESC>
Wmaker is stable and lightweight.  It is a modern, themeable window
manager with a fairly easy-to-use interface.  It seems to be the most
popular window manager that parents use with their children at this
point (and for themselves as well).  My only complaint with it is that
icons on the wharf need to be double-clicked to launch an application,
whereas single-click would be better for the very young.  I find the
wharf easier to configure than fvwm buttons because a new icon box that
can be dragged onto the wharf is created automatically as you launch new
applications either from the command-line or menus.
</DESC>

<NAME>xfce</NAME>
<DESC>
This is more than just a window manager.  It is a lightweight desktop
environment that will actually run on low-end hardware (unlike KDE

<P>
LyX comes with an excellent tutorial and help structure. The 
documentation is the best I've seen for ANY software on any O/S!
<P>
For the younger audience, they can just start typing away and see the
result with a ps or dvi preview. The sections can be selected from a
pull-down menu for easy formatting and there are a lot of tool-bar
buttons for most functions. There are a few different document types
available and as the child uses it more, they can learn how to create
more document types to suit their needs. Being LaTeX based, it gives a
good introduction to the TeX based world of text editing in a very easy
to use manner. Together with the tutorial and help documents, the child
can advance at their own pace until they are ready to move to TeX or
LaTeX for a truly professional DeskTop publishing tool.
