<NAME>lletters</NAME>

Great for the youngest (2yo).

<NAME>codebreaker</NAME>
<DESC>
Haven't yet shown them this, but *I* like it :)
</DESC>

<NAME>xjig</NAME>
<DESC>
A favourite for my 5 and ups.  But "2 sided" puzzles are confusing for the
young children.  I'd like to be able to save as a default config for the
children the "-side 2" switch to force all of the pieces to be flipped
over to side 2 at the beginning so they don't have to manually flip them
over.  Also, I'd like to be able to disable the middle-mouse-button
mapping to flip pieces, as they sometimes accidentally hit it, much to
their puzzlement (no pun intended) and frustration.  A gui-based puzzle
launcher that allows the child to point-and-click to choose the puzzle
image and size would be great.
</DESC>

<NAME>gimp</NAME>
<DESC>
A bit complex for the 5yo, and even the older ones, but they all do have
fun with it. 
</DESC>

<NAME>xpaint</NAME>
<DESC>
Not quite as complex as the gimp, but a bit clunky in the GUI and not
nearly as dazzling effects. 
</DESC>

<NAME>mc</NAME>
<DESC>
Includes mcedit.  Helps give children a good understanding of filesystems. 
</DESC>

<NAME>xteddy</NAME>
<DESC>
Cute, cuddly desktop toy.
</DESC>

<NAME>fortune</NAME>
<DESC>
Fortune could be polished to display only jokes which children would like
more than general ones.
</DESC>

<NAME>freeciv</NAME>
<DESC>
Polishing could be done by setting game parameters and maybe we could give
a slight hint in the docs on how to become a millionaire ;-). 
</DESC>

<NAME>emacs</NAME>
<DESC>
No, this is not a joke.  Why not start them out with the "ultimate"
editor? 
</DESC>

<NAME>nano</NAME>
<DESC>
A nice lightweight editor.  This is a free replacement for pico.  When
the kids were switched to it, they barely noticed the difference.
</DESC>

<NAME>pingus</NAME>
<DESC>
Free Lemmings(tm) clone
</DESC>

<NAME>ace-of-penguins</NAME>
<DESC>
Solitaire-games with penguin-look.
</DESC>

<NAME>lmemory</NAME>
<DESC>
Classic "memory" card-matching game.  Suitable for younger children.
</DESC>

<NAME>bsdgames</NAME>
<DESC>
Text games and puzzles the children love: boggle, hangman, worm, snake,
arithmetic, fish.  Some of the more challenging ones like quiz are hard
even for adults, and therefore may only be suitable for your oldest
children.
</DESC>

<NAME>armagetron</NAME>
<DESC>
You need a good 3D accelerated graphics card for this one.  The controls
are fairly easy to work, but the game is a bit shy on help.  Compared to
gltron, this one is a bit easier to control.
</DESC>

<NAME>gltron</NAME>
<DESC>
Another 3D tron game requiring acceleration.  The crashes are a bit more
interesting than armagetron and the sound effects appeal to the
children.
</DESC>

<NAME>tuxracer</NAME>
<DESC>
Our children's favourite 3D accelerated game.  Tux zooms down an icy
mountain race course gobbling up herring.  Sometimes he gets stuck,
which is a bit frustrating.  The "practice" mode is what the children
prefer to use.
</DESC>

<NAME>bumprace</NAME>
<DESC>
A bouncy maze with nice sound effects and graphics.  Challenging at the
higher levels, but some levels are easy enough even for my boy of six
years age.
</DESC>

<NAME>heroes</NAME>
<DESC>
Spectacular graphics and sound.  A 2D "tron" type game with lots of
powerups and special effects.
</DESC>

<NAME>circuslinux</NAME>
<DESC>
A clown is fired out of a cannon onto a teeter-totter which you control
to bounce a second clown up into the air to pop balloons under a big-top
circus tent.  The game is funny and had my children in fits of giggles.
</DESC>

<NAME>bugsquish</NAME>
<DESC>
Swat the bugs before they suck all of the blood from your arm.  My
little boy loves this because it is gross.  My eldest daughter hates
this because it is gross. ;)
</DESC>

<NAME>gbatnav</NAME>
<DESC>
A "battleship" game.
</DESC>

<NAME>gtans</NAME>
<DESC>
A "tangram" puzzle.  Stimulating and challenging.  Tangrams encourage
creativity and geometry skills both at once.
</DESC>

<NAME>tuxtype</NAME>
<DESC>
Educational typing tutor game starring Tux.  The children enjoy using
this game to learn how to type.  It has funny sound effects and graphics
that keep their attention.  It doesn't really teach touch-typing,
though.
</DESC>

<NAME>typist</NAME>
<DESC>
The young children in our household (eldest, 10) find typist a bit
dull.  It is more suited for older children or adults.
</DESC>

<NAME>tipptrainer</NAME>
<DESC>
A touch-typing program which may have more appeal to children than
typist.
</DESC>

<NAME>dict</NAME>
<DESC>
Look up words from the command line.  My 10-year-old loves words and
uses this frequently.
</DESC>

<NAME>cdtool</NAME>
<DESC>
The children have a number of their own CDs and can use the simple
commands "cdplay" and "cdstop" to start and stop playing.  Although a
number of gui-based players exist, it just seems simpler to use this
tool.
</DESC>

<NAME>bplay</NAME>
<DESC>
When the eldest children were very small and my most powerful system was
a P100, we downloaded some wav sound-bytes from the net and made
appropriately named commands for bplay to play each of them.  They could
then use the VT-420 terminal in the livingroom to play these from bash.
They learned how to play several in a row using semicolons between them.
They also learned to use tab command-completion to help view and select
the right one.  The youngest, then aged three, could simply press
up-arrow and enter to play them over and over again until the parents
had enough. :)
</DESC>

<NAME>xeyes</NAME>
<DESC>
Even the very youngest children (aged 1 or 2) will appreciate this
classic interactive desktop toy.  With some parental help, eyes can be
resized by clicking and dragging.  Whole armies of eyes can be created
which will all obediently follow the pointer as the child moves the
mouse.
</DESC>

<NAME>xfishtank</NAME>
<DESC>
More desktop fun.  Colorful fish swim around on your root window.
</DESC>

<NAME>oneko</NAME>
<DESC>
My nine-year-old girl's favourite desktop toy.  Tiny cats and dogs
chase a mouse-shaped or bone-shaped pointer across the desktop and
fall asleep when you bring it to rest.
</DESC>

<NAME>xpenguins</NAME>
<DESC>
Little penguins walk on your windows.  You can "herd" them by moving
windows around.
</DESC>

<NAME>xsnow</NAME>
<DESC>
A seasonal desktop toy.
</DESC>

<NAME>luxman</NAME>
<DESC>
A classic, loved by the whole family.
(J, only 2, loves the sounds and bright colors while others play :)
In our opinion, the best "Pacman" clone.  However, it has the
disadvantages that come with being a libsvga program.  That is, it
cannot be played in X, and is a security risk, since it must run
as root (or suid root).
</DESC>

<NAME>madbomber</NAME>
<DESC>
Catch bombs in a tub full of water to snuff them out as the "mad bomber"
zips back and forth, dropping them from atop a wall.
</DESC>

<NAME>mozilla</NAME>
<DESC>
An indispensable research tool for school projects.  Parents will likely
need to offer guidance to help children find appropriate and accurate
information via search engines and portals.  Mozilla is now stable
enough to consider using it as a replacement for the non-free Netscape.
</DESC>

<NAME>xblast</NAME>
<DESC>
Children probably need parental help to set up a match on a network.
With a network of old 486s and the parents' K6-2's, this game provides
some nice family networked fun.  Based on the classic "bomberman" game,
there are virtually limitless levels.  The neighbor kids have nothing
like this at home (possibly because they don't have a house full of
old PCs :)
</DESC>

<NAME>gnome-stones</NAME>
<DESC>
A game based on "Diamond Run".  It gets more challenging on higher
levels.  It lacks sound at the moment, which was a part of the appeal
in the original game.
</DESC>

<NAME>xboing</NAME>
<DESC>
An excellent "pong" type game.  Parents may not appreciate the expletive
("aw shit") used when a ball is lost.  However, this can be easily
fixed /usr/lib/games/xboing/sounds by copying "Doh1.au" on top of
"balllost.au".
</DESC>

<NAME>lbreakout</NAME>
<DESC>
A newer "pong" game.  It is a bit more difficult for children than
xboing because you cannot adjust the speed.  A milder expletive is used
at the end of the game ("damn").  We haven't bothered trying to fix
this, as it is not quite as obvious or frequent as in xboing.
Furthermore, it appears a source-code change would be required to make
the fix.  We have worked around the problem by suggesting creative
mis-hearings of the word (we have offered "dead", "jam", "jammin'",
"toe-jam" :)
</DESC>

<NAME>gcompris</NAME>
<DESC>
A basic skill-building game suitable for age three and up.  Helps
develop mouse, typing, math and time-telling skills.
</DESC>
