<H3>Packages suitable for children</H3>

This list and the comments attached are the personal opinion of the Debian
Jr. developers, and don't represent a formal pronouncement by Debian on
their suitability for children. 

<P> The initial list and comments have been drawn up from packages list
members have tried with their children and they like.  More will be added
as we look more systematically at Debian. 

<H4>In Debian</H4>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADING=5 CELLSPACING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>lletters</B><TD>Great for the youngest (2yo).
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>codebreaker</B><TD>Haven't yet shown them this, but
*I* like it :)
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>xjig</B><TD>A favourite for my 5 and ups.  But "2
sided" puzzles are confusing for the young children.  I'd like to be able
to save as a default config for the children the "-side 2" switch to force
all of the pieces to be flipped over to side 2 at the beginning so they
don't have to manually flip them over.  Also, I'd like to be able to
disable the middle-mouse-button mapping to flip pieces, as they sometimes
accidentally hit it, much to their puzzlement (no pun intended) and
frustration.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>gimp</B><TD>A bit complex for the 5yo, and even the
older ones, but they all do have fun with it.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>xpaint</B><TD>Not quite as complex as the gimp, but
a bit clunky in the GUI and not nearly as dazzling effects.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>luxman</B><TD>A classic, loved by the whole family
(J, only 2, loves the sounds and bright colors while others play :)
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>mc</B><TD>Includes mcedit.  Helps give children a
good understanding of filesystems.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>xteddy</B><TD>Cute, cuddly desktop toy.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>fortune</B><TD>Fortune could be polished to display
only jokes which children would like more than general ones.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>freeciv</B><TD>Polishing could be done by setting
game parameters and maybe we could give a slight hint in the docs on how
to become a millionaire ;-).
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>emacs</B><TD>No, this is not a joke.  Why not start
them out with the "ultimate" editor?
</TABLE>

<H4>In non-free</H4>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADING=5 CELLSPACING=5>
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>pico</B><TD>I think I could switch the family to
nano (free pico clone) now and they won't miss too much the features that
aren't done yet.
<TR VALIGN=TOP><TD><B>xmame</B><TD>Unfortunately it looks like this will
forever be non-free, the license is really ugly.  The kids all love it,
and there's nothing like it in main.
