This list and the comments attached are the personal opinion of the Debian
Jr. developers, and don't represent a formal pronouncement by Debian on
their suitability for children.  The age range for this list is age 8
and under, although some of the more complex programs require help
from an older person.

<P> The initial list and comments have been drawn up from packages list
members have tried with their children and they like.  More will be added
as we look more systematically at Debian.  Because the lists are
manually maintained, they are more than likely out of date.  Please
email any submissions to <a href="mailto:synrg@debian.org">synrg@debian.org</a>
and I will have them updated.

These packages are not a part of Debian or Debian Jr.  We list them
here for reference because there is no suitable alternative in Debian
yet.
