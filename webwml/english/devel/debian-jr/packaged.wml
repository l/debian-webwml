<H3>Packages suitable for children</H3>

This list and the comments attached are the personal opinion of the Debian
Jr. developers, and don't represent a formal pronouncement by Debian on
their suitability for children. 

<P> The initial list and comments have been drawn up from packages list
members have tried with their children and they like.  More will be added
as we look more systematically at Debian.
