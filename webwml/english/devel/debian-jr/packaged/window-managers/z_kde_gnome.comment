KDE &amp; Gnome
In looking for a desktop environment, we realize that many parents
will want to try either KDE or Gnome, but in the interests of keeping
Debian Jr. a simple base, we have left those off the list for now.
Naturally, any programs in Debian, including the vast amount of material
available for KDE and Gnome may be added to enhance a Debian Jr. system,
just like any other Debian system.
