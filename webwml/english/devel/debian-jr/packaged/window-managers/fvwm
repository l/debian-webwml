<DESC>
A simple, lightweight window manager.  The fvwm buttons allow
easy single-click access to applications for the very young.  At
the same time it is powerful and configurable so it scales well
as the child matures.  There are more modern window managers available
with prettier features, but that usually comes at the expense of
bloating the window manager.
