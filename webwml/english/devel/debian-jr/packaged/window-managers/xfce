This is more than just a window manager.  It is a lightweight desktop
environment that will actually run on low-end hardware (unlike KDE
or Gnome).  It is themeable, easy to use and configure, and has been
tested with our children with favourable results.  Some work is required
to make the default panel that ships with it more child-friendly.
