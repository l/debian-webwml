Wmaker is stable and lightweight.  It is a modern, themeable window
manager with a fairly easy-to-use interface.  It seems to be the most
popular window manager that parents use with their children at this
point (and for themselves as well).  My only complaint with it is that
icons on the wharf need to be double-clicked to launch an application,
whereas single-click would be better for the very young.  I find the
wharf easier to configure than fvwm buttons because a new icon box that
can be dragged onto the wharf is created automatically as you launch new
applications either from the command-line or menus.
