Timidity++ is basically a command-line based MIDI file player that will
give you a new respect for the MIDI format.  Rather than use the
built-in instruments of your sound card, which can sound rather poor,
Timidity++ uses software-based instrument patches which sound extremely
good.  Timidity++ by itself has no instrument patches but
timidity-patches will provide them. Timidity++ does not depend on
Timidity-patches because you can use many different patches available
free and for a price from various sources.  Playing a MIDI file with
Timidity++ and the Timidity-patches will sound very like the real thing!
You will never what to use the built-in instruments of your sound card
again!  Timidity++ also has a few different GUI's available, but these
need to be compiled in. They are based on gtk+, motif or lesstif, even
an ncurses interface can be compiled in. I've played with a few of these
and find the gtk+ GUI to be quite easy to use, although it does generate
a few errors, I've never had it crash or hang on me. And I have used it
quite a bit. You would need to try the different interfaces and see
which would be best for the Debian JR project.
