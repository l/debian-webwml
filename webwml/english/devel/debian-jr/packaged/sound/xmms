XMMS is for Linux what WinAmp is for Windows and a whole lot more!
<P>
Starting out as just a WinAmp clone for Linux, XMMS initially provides
the exact same functionality for playing compressed audio files.  It
has
a playlist and equaliser as well as being skinable.  Thanks to the
modular nature of Linux, Lots of different input, process and output
modules are available for XMMS to expand its usability.  It even has
an
OpenGL 3D spectrum analyser display available, but be warned!!!  This
is
memory hungry without a great 3D graphics card to share the load.
<P>
Again, like grip, although originally intended for the
patent-encumbered
mp3 format, xmms can be used with the patent-free ogg format which is
what we recommend.
