Grip is a rather easy to use, once set up, ripper and CD player.
Copying your children's favourite CDs to your hard drive can make it
much easier for them to select and play their own music.
<P>
Use the patent-free, open-source ogg-vorbis for encoding.  Grip
supports ogg as well as the patent-encumbered mp3 format.  It refers
in the menus everywhere to mp3, but if you look closely, oggenc is
one of the possible encoders.  Remember to change the output file
extension from mp3 to ogg.
