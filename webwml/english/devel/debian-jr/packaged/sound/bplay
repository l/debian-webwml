When the eldest children were very small and my most powerful system
was
a P100, we downloaded some wav sound-bytes from the net and made
appropriately named commands for bplay to play each of them.  They
could
then use the VT-420 terminal in the livingroom to play these from
bash.
They learned how to play several in a row using semicolons between
them.
They also learned to use tab command-completion to help view and
select
the right one.  The youngest, then aged three, could simply press
up-arrow and enter to play them over and over again until the parents
had enough. :)
