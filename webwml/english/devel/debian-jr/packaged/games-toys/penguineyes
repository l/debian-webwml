This is an xeyes-like desktop toy which supports a number of fun
themes
including Linus, Tux, Dust Puppy and a GNU.  In addition to resizing,
you can flip the character with movable eyes upside-down or
left-to-right, or put it in "guilty/paranoid" mode in which the
character always looks away from the pointer instead of towards it.
