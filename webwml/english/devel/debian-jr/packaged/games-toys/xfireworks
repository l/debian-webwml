Displays fireworks (as in the familiar <b>xscreensaver</b> hack) on
your root window.  Unfortunately, there is no "stop xfireworks" at
this time in the menu.  That's OK, though, as it was an opportunity to
teach the children how to use <b>killall</b>. Also, the fireworks "eat"
the image behind it, much as <b>xhangglider</b> does.
