In addition to using the screensaver hacks as screensavers, they can
be started with various command line options as toys for your
desktop (e.g. using the -root switch).  On slower systems, screensaver
hacks may be more successfully run in their own window than in the
root window because they take less CPU to refresh.  Use the -demo
option to try out different screensavers.
