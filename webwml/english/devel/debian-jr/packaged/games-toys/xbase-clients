The <b>xeyes</b> toy is included in this package.  Even the very
youngest children (aged 1 or 2) will appreciate this classic
interactive
desktop toy.  With some parental help, eyes can be resized by clicking
and dragging.  Whole armies of eyes can be created which will all
obediently follow the pointer as the child moves the mouse.
