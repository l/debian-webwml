A solar system and celestial body viewer, Ssystem uses OpenGL models
of the planets and various other objects.  A 3d video card is
recommended, but it is quite useable (at ~3fps) on my P133 machine.
The interface is a bit difficult and confusing.
<p>
Openuniverse is the successor to ssystem, so we are working on having
that packaged.
