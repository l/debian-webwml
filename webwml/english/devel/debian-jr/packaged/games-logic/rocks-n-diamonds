Like Boulderdash, this is a 2D scrolling puzzle game in which you guide
the hero with simple directional controls through one of seemingly
countless numbers of levels.  The hero must avoid falling rocks and
other hazards and collect enough diamonds or meet some other
objective to open the exit and escape before the time runs out.
Children must use logic to work through a number of perplexing
situations in each level to guide the hero safely to the end of the
level.  Being able to start at any level helps keep frustration in
check, as a difficult level can be simply left until later and a
different level chosen at any time. The integrated level editor is lots
of fun and relatively easy to use (although designing good levels can be
tricky for a child).  The children love to play with the level editor as
well as play with the game.
