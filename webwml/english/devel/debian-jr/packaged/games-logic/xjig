A favourite for my 5 and ups.  But "2 sided" puzzles are confusing for
the
young children.  I'd like to be able to save as a default config for
the
children the "-side 2" switch to force all of the pieces to be flipped
over to side 2 at the beginning so they don't have to manually flip
them
over.  Also, I'd like to be able to disable the middle-mouse-button
mapping to flip pieces, as they sometimes accidentally hit it, much to
their puzzlement (no pun intended) and frustration.  A gui-based
puzzle
launcher that allows the child to point-and-click to choose the puzzle
image and size would be great.
