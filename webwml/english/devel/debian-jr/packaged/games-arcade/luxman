A classic, loved by the whole family.
(J, only 2, loves the sounds and bright colors while others play :))
In our opinion, the best "Pacman" clone.  However, it has the
disadvantages that come with being a svgalib program.  That is, it
cannot be played in X, and is a security risk, since it must run
as root (or suid root).
