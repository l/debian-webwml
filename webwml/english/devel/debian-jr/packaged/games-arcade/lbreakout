A newer "pong" game.  It is a bit more difficult for children than
xboing because you cannot adjust the speed.  A milder expletive is used
at the end of the game ("damn").  We haven't bothered trying to fix
this, as it is not quite as obvious or frequent as in xboing.
Furthermore, it appears a source-code change would be required to make
the fix.  We have worked around the problem by suggesting creative
mis-hearings of the word (we have offered "dead", "jam", "jammin'", "toe-jam" :))
