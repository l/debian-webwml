XSoldier is a very fast 2-D shoot-em-up game similar to Galaxians and
other space games.
<P>
The down-sides are:
<OL>
<LI>It can be more memory-hungry than other games. The response is
sluggish under 16M of memory.
<LI>It requires 1024 X 768 to fit on the screen.
</OL>
Aside from those two drawbacks, it is a fast-paced, engaging and
enjoyable game for many age groups. My 11 Year old Daughter has great
fun playing it, when she can get me away from it : )
