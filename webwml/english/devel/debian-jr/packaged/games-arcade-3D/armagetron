You need a good 3D accelerated graphics card for this one.  The
controls
are fairly easy to work, but the game is a bit shy on help.  Compared
to
gltron, this one is a bit easier to control.  Networked play is also
possible, though with only one system in the house with a decent 3D
card I haven't tried it yet.
