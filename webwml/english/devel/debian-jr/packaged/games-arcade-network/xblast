Children probably need parental help to set up a match on a network.
With a network of old 486s and the parents' K6-2's, this game provides
some nice family networked fun.  Based on the classic "bomberman"
game,
there are virtually limitless levels.  The neighbor kids have nothing
like this at home (possibly because they don't have a house full of
old PCs :)
