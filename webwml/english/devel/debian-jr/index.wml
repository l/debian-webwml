<H2>Debian for children from 1 to 99</H2>

This is an internal project to make Debian an OS that children of
all ages will want to use.  Our initial focus will be on producing
something for children up to age 8.  Once we have accomplished this,
our next target age range is 7 to 12.  By the time children reach their
teens, they should be comfortable with using Debian without any special
modifications.

<H3>Debian Jr. Goals</H3>

<H4>Making Debian desirable to children</H4>

The primary goal of the Debian Jr. project is to make Debian an OS our
children <i>want</i> to run.  This involves some sensitivity to the
needs of children as expressed by the children themselves.  As parents,
developers, older siblings, sys admins, we need to keep our ears and
eyes open and discover what it is that makes computers desirable to
children.  Without this focus, we can easily get sidetracked trying to
achieve abstract goals like "user friendliness", "simplicity", "low
maintenance", or "robustness" that, while they are certainly laudable
goals for Debian as a whole, are too broad for addressing the specific
needs and wants of children.

<H4>Working with other child-oriented free software projects</H4>

Other projects already exist (e.g. <a href="http://www.seul.org/edu/"
>SEUL/edu</a>, <a href="http://www.smluc.org/SIA/kidsgames/">Kids Games</a>,
and <a href="http://www.linuxforkids.com/">LinuxForKids</a>) that have
goals which overlap and dovetail with our own. 
Rather than duplicate their effort, we need to work with these groups to
ensure that Debian makes the best use of their work, and makes
contributions back to those efforts of our own.  Debian Jr. should stay
focused on (but not limited to) Debian-specific goals.  Individuals from
Debian Jr. are encouraged to join these other groups as time and interest
allow.

<H4>Applications</H4>

Naturally, children have different needs and wants from adults in the
applications they choose to run.  Some of these will be games, while others
will be word processors, text editors, "paint" programs, and the like. 
The goal is to identify applications within Debian that are suitable for
children and add to that number by packaging ones not yet in Debian.  A
possible implementation goal would be to provide "task-" packages to make
installing groups of "child friendly" applications easier for the sys
admin.  A subgoal is to take existing packages that might be suitable
for children with a bit of extra work and help "polish" them to make them
"child friendly", which could be as simple as filling in holes in the
documentation, or adding entries to the menu system for easy access.

<H4>Childproofing and account management</H4>

The idea here is not to necessarily to implement tough security measures. 
That is beyond our mandate.  The goal is simply to provide
sys admins with documentation and tools for setting up their
systems so that their naturally curious child users will not "break" their
accounts, soak up all system resources, or otherwise do things that
require constant sys admin intervention.  This is a more of a concern for
child users than adults, as they tend to explore and deliberately push the
system to the limits just to see what happens.  The messes that result can
be at once both amusing and frustrating.  This goal is about keeping your
sanity (and sense of humor) as a child's sys admin.

<H4>Learning to use the computer</H4>

The "Childproofing" goal needs to be balanced with the goal of <i>allowing</i>
children to try things (and yes, break things) and find solutions to their
problems.  Learning to use the keyboard, GUI, shell, and computer
languages are all things that parents and children alike need some tips to
help get them headed in the right direction. 

<H4>User interface</H4>

Discover and implement both GUI and text-based interfaces that work well
for and are attractive to children.  The idea is not to re-invent the user
interface, but to add value to existing tools and packages (window
managers, menu system and so forth) by providing some convenient
pre-selected configurations that we find work best for children.

<H4>Family guidance</H4>

Give parents (and in some cases, older siblings) the tools to help their
children (or siblings) learn about computers and to put reasonable
limits on their access, guiding them towards independent use of the
computer as they mature.  For example, many parents will be concerned
about regulating Internet use to protect their children until they reach
a suitable age to deal with mature content.  The important thing to
remember is that the parents will chose what they think is best for
their children.  The Debian Jr. group does not make this judgement, but
is there to help provide the tools and documentation to help the parents
with these decisions.  That being said, I think this goal should focus
more on the "guidance" aspect than restriction, as the former is a
positive activity while the latter is negative.

<H4>Children's System</H4>

While our first goal as children's sys admins will probably be to set up
the children with
accounts on our own systems and populate it with applications that they
enjoy, there comes a time when we contemplate getting them their own
system.  The most ambitious realization of this goal might be a Debian
software equivalent of the "toy" computers currently on the market: 
brightly colored, decal-covered systems pre-loaded with software
appealing to children of a specific age range.  It
is important to keep in perspective that this would still be a Debian
system, not some fork from the Debian distribution.  It is a perfectly
achievable goal through the Debian package management system (via "task-" 
packages, for example) and should not require a fork in development to
produce a special Debian "children's edition". 

<H4>Ports</H4>

There are lots of excellent applications out there designed for or
appealing to children that we wish
would be ported to Linux.  We can help move the process along by first,
demonstrating that Debian is a viable platform for children by the work of
this project, and second, by our individual and collective efforts to
petition software vendors and authors to make ports of their products
for Linux.  If they can be convinced to open source their software at
the same time, so much the better.

<H4>Internationalization</H4>

While English may be the "universal" language, not all children speak it
as their mother tongue.  And while internationalization should be a goal
of Debian itself, language problems are amplified when dealing with children.
Children will not want to use Debian if support for their language is not
there, and will find it more comfortable to use other OS's where language
support is better.  Therefore, we do need to keep this in mind.

<H4>Marketing &amp; PR</H4>

Once we have something to show for this project, and indeed even in the
formative stages of this project, we are being watched by the eyes of
the world (I have already received one private email from a member of
the press).  We will necessarily want to work with press@debian.org to
get the word out and to help give Debian and this project the kind of
exposure we want.  I know many of us as developers are oblivious to such
concerns, or even loath to be involved with such things, but if we don't
keep this goal in mind from the outset, we're giving up this role to
others who may not understand or accurately represent what we're about.
