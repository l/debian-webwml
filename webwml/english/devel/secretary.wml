    <h1 class="title">The Debian Project Secretary</h1>
    
    <p class="initial">
      As the <a href="$(HOME)/">Debian project</a> grew,
      it became apparent that there needed to be a set of semi-formal
      rules to help in conflict resolution, and as a result the
      constitution was written.  The Debian
      <a href="constitution">constitution</a>
      describes the organisational structure for formal decision
      making in the Project. The constitution delineates who makes
      decisions, and what powers are attached to each such decision
      making individual or body. The office of the Project Secretary
      is one of the six entities enumerated in the Debian constitution
      as a decision making entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any Debian developer is eligible to be considered for the post
      of the Debian Project Secretary.  Any person may hold several
      posts, except that the Project Secretary may not also be the
      Debian Project Leader, or the Chairman of the 
      <a href="tech-ctte">Technical Committee</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Appointment</h2>

    <p>
      Unlike other delegates, who are appointed by the Project Leader,
      the Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader and the
      current Project Secretary. In case the current secretary and the
      project leader disagree, they must ask the board of SPI to appoint a
      Secretary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point
      they or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks performed by the Project Secretary</h2>
    

    <h3>Conducting votes</h3>
    <p>
      The most visible task performed by the secretary is conducting
      <a href="$(HOME)/vote/">votes</a> for the project
      -- notably the Project Leader elections, but also any other
      votes that are run (General Resolutions, for example). Running a
      vote also entails determining the number and identity of the
      people eligible to vote, for the purpose of calculating quorum.
    </p>

    <h3>Standing in for other Officers</h3>

    <p>
      The Project Secretary can stand in for the Leader, together with
      the Chairman of the Technical Committee. In this situation, they
      may jointly make decisions if they consider it imperative to do
      so -- but only when absolutely necessary and only when
      consistent with the consensus of the Developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
      unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then
      the decision may be made or delegated by the Chairman of the
      Technical Committee, as Acting Secretary.
    </p>

    <h3>Interpreting the Constitution</h3>
    
    <p>
      The secretary is also responsible for adjudicating any disputes
      about interpretation of the constitution.
    </p>
    <h1 class="center">Current Incumbent</h1>

    <p>
      The current Project Secretary is Manoj Srivastava 
      &lt;<a href="mailto:srivasta@debian.org">srivasta@debian.org</a>&gt;.
      Manoj has been dabbling with free software since 1987, with
      Linux since 1993, and has been a Debian developer since 
      <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/1995/debian-devel-199511/msg00343.html">November 1995</a>.
      Manoj is an electrical engineer by training, (solid state
      devices, to be specific), and only drifted into computers as an
      after-thought. (Mostly because he was not a scientist at heart,
      and could not deal with the psyche of electrons &mdash; like how
      electrons refuse to revert to wave behaviour even though the
      electron counter along the beam is turned off - and  unplugged
      -  since the electrons know us humans are tricky.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Manoj has been Project secretary since April 2001; after the
      previous office bearer, Darren Benham, faded away out of the
      Project.  Apart from being the Project Secretary, Manoj is also
      a member of the <a href="tech-ctte">Debian Technical Committee</a>,
      sits on the boards of
      <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">SPI</a> and 
      <a href="http://www.opengroup.org/opendce/">OpenDCE</a>, is one of
      the <a href="$(HOME)/doc/debian-policy/">Policy</a>
      editors, and maintains 
       <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php/developer.php?login=srivasta">17
      packages</a> 
      (<a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/games/angband.html">one
	of which</a> is non-free.)
    </p>

    <p>
      Having wandered down from 
      <a href="http://www.yankeemagazine.com/travel/">New England</a>
      to the Heart of Dixie
      (<a href="http://www.cityofmobile.org/">Mobile</a>, AL, USA)
      following his wife, Manoj has now settled in the 
      <a href="http://www.wbry.com/woodbury.htm">boonies</a> of
      Tennessee (again following his spouse) in a house on the well
      watered hills of the highland rim of the Cumberland plateau,
      complete with a herd of
       <a href="http://www.datasync.com/%7Esrivasta/House/">deer</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Given the remoteness of the locations where he has lived, Manoj
      has been telecommuting since he moved away from the <a
      href="http://www.umass.edu/">University of Massachusetts</a> in
      1996. He first started out as as a global consultant for DEC,
      and then moved to being a research programmer for various 
      <a href="http://www.stdc.com/">small companies</a> working on
      <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/">DARPA</a> grants. Since he has
      had to maintain his own remote office, free software (and
      Debian) facilitates his bread and butter. Given the projects he
      works on, he has been fortunate enough to be able to work on
      <a href="http://www.stdc.com/QMS/">free software on his day
	job</a> as well.
