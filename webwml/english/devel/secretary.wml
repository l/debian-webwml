    <h1 class="title">The Debian Project Secretary</h1>
    
    <p class="initial">
      As the <a href="$(HOME)/">Debian project</a> grew,
      it became apparent that there needed to be a set of semi-formal
      rules to help in conflict resolution, and as a result the
      constitution was written.  The Debian
      <a href="constitution">constitution</a>
      describes the organisational structure for formal decision
      making in the Project. The constitution delineates who makes
      decisions, and what powers are attached to each such decision
      making individual or body. The office of the Project Secretary
      is one of the six entities enumerated in the Debian constitution
      as a decision making entity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Any Debian developer is eligible to be considered for the post
      of the Debian Project Secretary.  Any person may hold several
      posts, except that the Project Secretary may not also be the
      <a href="leader">Debian Project Leader</a>, or the Chairman of the
      <a href="tech-ctte">Technical Committee</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Appointment</h2>

    <p>
      Unlike other delegates, who are appointed by the
      <a href="leader">Project Leader</a>,
      the next Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader
      and the current Project Secretary. In case the current secretary
      and the project leader disagree, they must ask the Developers by
      way of general resolution to appoint a Secretary.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point
      they or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.
    </p>

    <h2>Tasks performed by the Project Secretary</h2>
    

    <h3>Conducting votes</h3>
    <p>
      The most visible task performed by the secretary is conducting
      <a href="$(HOME)/vote/">votes</a> for the project
      -- notably the Project Leader elections, but also any other
      votes that are run (General Resolutions, for example). Running a
      vote also entails determining the number and identity of the
      people eligible to vote, for the purpose of calculating quorum.
    </p>

    <h3>Standing in for other Officers</h3>

    <p>
      The Project Secretary can stand in for the Leader, together with
      the Chairman of the Technical Committee. In this situation, they
      may jointly make decisions if they consider it imperative to do
      so -- but only when absolutely necessary and only when
      consistent with the consensus of the Developers.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
      unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then
      the decision may be made or delegated by the Chairman of the
      Technical Committee, as Acting Secretary.
    </p>

    <h3>Interpreting the Constitution</h3>
    
    <p>
      The secretary is also responsible for adjudicating any disputes
      about interpretation of the constitution.
    </p>

    <h1 class="center">About Our Current Secretary</h1>

    <p>
	  The current Project Secretary is Kurt Roeckx 
	  &lt;<email "kroeckx@debian.org">&gt;.
	  Kurt has been involved with free software and linux since 1995, and has
	  been a Debian Developer since
	  <a href='http://lists.debian.org/debian-project/2005/08/msg00283.html'>August 2005</a>.<br />
	  Kurt has a Masters degree in Electronics and ICT, awarded by Hogeschool
	  voor Wetenschap &amp; Kunst.
    </p>

	<p>
	  Kurt has been Project Secretary since February 2009; he took up the
	  position after the previous secretary, Manoj Srivastava, resigned from
	  the position. Apart from being Project Secretary, Kurt is an AMD64 porter
	  and maintains 
	  <a href="http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=kurt@roeckx.be">12 packages</a>
	  including libtool, ntp and openssl.
	</p>

	<h2>The assistant secretary post</h2>

	<p>
	  Due to the increasing amount of work (i.e.: votes) that the secretary was
	  starting to need to handle, the DPL (at the time, Steve McIntyre) and the
	  previous secretary (Manoj) decided that it would be a good idea to
	  appoint an assistant in cases of unavailability.<br />
	  Currently, Neil McGovern &lt;<email "neilm@debian.org">&gt; serves in
	  this position.
