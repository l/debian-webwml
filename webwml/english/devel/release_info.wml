#use wml::debian::template title="Release Information"

<P>Unlike most commercial operating systems, Debian is constantly being improved.
Each major release generally involves the addition of new capabilities while
minor releases only involve software upgrades.
In addition, the
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</A> kernel is constantly being improved.
The nicknames for each release, seen below, are given during development
to keep them separate from released versions.

<P>The goals below are not necessarily required before release of that
version of Debian. They are things that we are shooting for. If a goal
is not fully implemented and does not adversely affect the stability
of a release it will not hold up the release of a new version.

<P>Any corrections/updates should be sent to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.
Discussions regarding the actual release goals are held on the debian-devel
mailing list.
