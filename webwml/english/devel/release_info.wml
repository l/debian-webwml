#use wml::debian::template title="Release Information"

<P>Unlike most commercial operating systems, Debian is constantly being improved.
Each major release generally involves the addition of new capabilities while
minor releases only involve software upgrades.
In addition, the
<A HREF="http://www.linux.org">Linux</A> kernel is constantly being improved.
The nicknames for each release, seen below, are given during development
to keep them separate from released versions.

<P>The goals below are not necessarily required before release of that
version of Debian. They are things that we are shooting for. If a goal
is not fully implemented and does not adversely affect the stability
of a release it will not hold up the release of a new version.

<P>Any corrections/updates should be sent to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.
Discussions regarding the actual release goals are held on the debian-devel
mailing list.

<A NAME="ports"><H3>Architectures:</H3></A>
Debian has or is working on releases for all architectures supported by the
Linux Kernel.

<UL>
<LI><STRONG>x86</STRONG><BR>
This is the original hardware Debian was based on and has the largest number
of users. Most of the general Debian development work is done here.
<br><i>supported machines:</i> 386, 486, all Pentium
<br><i>mailing list:</i> debian-user

<LI><STRONG>m68k</STRONG><BR>
The m68k port was officially released with Debian 2.0.
<br><i>supported machines:</i> atari, amiga, macs using this chipset.
<br><i>mailing list:</i> debian-m68k

<LI><STRONG>alpha</STRONG><BR>
The Alpha distribution is now to a state where installation of a
functional system including the base system and a useful set of
development tools is quite possible from scratch.
Not all of the packages available for the x86 have been
ported yet, but the Alpha distribution was the first Debian distribution
to depend on libc6.
<br><i>mailing list:</i> debian-alpha

<LI><STRONG>sparc</STRONG><BR>
The Sparc distribution is progressing, but is waiting for the port of glibc
to Sparc to stabilize before pushing for a release.
<br><i>mailing list:</i> debian-sparc

<LI><STRONG>mips</STRONG><BR>
*Very* early stage: only ~50 untested packages.
<br><i>mailing list:</i> debian-mips

<LI><STRONG>powerpc</STRONG><BR>
Early stage; about 250 working packages, but no install procedure
yet. (No release date planned yet)
