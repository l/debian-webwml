<H1>HOWTO translate Debian pages</H1>

<P>Thanks you for helping to translate the Debian web pages.
Instead of having a number of different sites hosting language
specific versions of the web pages, it is hoped that people
will concentrate on keeping a primary site which will host the
translations of a common set of web pages.

<H3>Background</H3>
<P>All the hand written (non documentation) files on the web site are
generated using wml. They are stored on cgi.debian.org using CVS.
You will want to check out a local copy of the wml files to edit
on your home machine. When you are done making changes, you can then
release the changes back to cgi.debian.org. Once a day, the copy of
the repository on master.debian.org will be updated. A Makefile is then
run on them to create the updated public web pages. Finaly, the pages are
distributed to all the web mirrors.

Contact them directly to get involved in a translation project.
Send mail to <a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
if you would like to coordinate the translation to a new language.

<H3>Using CVS</H3>
<P>In what follows anonymous access will be used as an example. If
you have access to another account which gives you write permission to
the repository then you should use that account instead.
To begin using CVS, you must first 'login' to the CVS server
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml login
</pre>
(just hit return for the password for anonymous)

<P>To check out a copy of the wml files on your local machine, you
need to use
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/&lt;lang&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;lang&gt; is the language you want. You will probably want
the English version in addition to the language you are working on.
If you only need a subset of the pages you can check out only those needed, e.g.
<kbd>cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/english/SPI</kbd>.

<P>From then on, you will not need to use the '-d :pserver:...' part.
Every few days you will want to do a
<pre>
   cvs update
</pre>
to retrieve any files from the repository which have changed.

<P>The following is for those who have write permission on the repository.
When you are done with the page, you can commit your changes to the repository using
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;dir&gt;   (to commit the changes in &lt;dir&gt;)
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit          (to commit all changes from the current dir down)
</pre>

<P>If you are the first person translating a page, you need to do
<pre>
   cvs add &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
before you commit it.

<P>For more information on CVS, use 'info cvs'.

<H3>Translating Pages</H3>
<P>To make the job of the translators as easy as possible the
pages are generated a bit differently than many of
you will be used to. The web pages are actually generated
using source that is marked up with wml. There are
separate directories for each language. To translate to a
new language, someone must first translate the wml template
files (not a big job).<br>
Important Note: do not modify the EN at the end of the DOCTYPE
line in template/debian/basic.wml.

<P>Because of the way the web servers are set up, you should not
have to change any of the internal links. There are times when
you may want to make a change to the content when you are
translating. One example is on the support page; you will
probably want to include an example on subscribing to the
language specific mailing list, e.g. debian-french on the
French version of the pages. If you make any other changes,
please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
as it is desired to keep the content as similar as possible
between the different versions.

<P>The first time a page is translated, send a note to
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
A script must be run on the pages to re-make the other language
versions so they will know about the new translation.

<P>I hope you find the work we've done will make translating
the pages as easy as possible.

<H3>How Does the Server Know Which File to Serve</H3>
<P>You will notice that internal links don't end in .html. This
is because the server is using content negotation to decide
which version of the document to deliver. When there is more
than one choice, the server will make a list of all possible
files to serve, e.g. if the request is for about, then the list
of completions might be about.html.en and about.html.de.
The default for Debian servers will be to serve the English
document, but it is configurable.

<P>If a client has the proper variable set, for example to serve German,
then in the example above about.html.de would be served. The
nice thing about this setup is that if the desired language is
not available, a different language will be delivered instead
(which hopefully is better than nothing). The decision on which
document is served is a bit confusing so instead of describing
it here, you should get the definitive answer from
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html">http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html</a>
if you are interested.

<P>Because many users will not even know of the existence of content-negotation,
there are links at the bottom of every page pointing directly
to the version of that page in every other language available.
This is computed using a perl script called by wml when the
page is generated. 

<H3>Example of Starting a Translation</H3>
French will be used for the example
<pre>
   cvs checkout webwml/english
   cd webwml
   mkdir french
   cvs add french
   cd french
   cp ../english/.wmlrc .
edit and change '-D CUR_LANG=English' to '-D CUR_LANG=French'
            and '-D CUR_ISO_LANG=en' to '-D CUR_ISO_LANG=fr'
   cp -r ../english/template .
edit template/debian/* and translate any text. This should be quite straightforward
   cp ../english/Make* .
edit Make.lang and change 'LANG=en' to 'LANG=fr'
The makefile in each directory will compile every .wml file it finds. If you
do not want or have not created a sub-directory and its accompanying Makefile
you will need to remove the appropriate line from the Makefile. You will
probably find it easier to create all the directories and makefiles up front though.
Since most people will not need to make modifications to the makefiles, it is ok
to let them be soft links to the English version.

When done adding pages, do a
   cvs commit
from the webwml directory.
</pre>
You can now start translating the pages.

<H3>Example of Translating a Page</H3>
A French translation of the social contract will be used for the example
<pre>
   cvs checkout webwml/english webwml/french   (if you hadn't already)
   cd webwml/french
   cp ../english/social_contract.wml .
   cvs add social_contract.wml
edit social_contract.wml and translate the text. Do not try to translate any
links or change them in any way. The '.en' at the end of the first line is
changed to '.fr'. When wml is fixed so that variables can be used on that line,
it will be changed to '.$(CUR_ISO_LANG)'.
When done, type
   cvs commit -m "short description of the changes you made" social_contract.wml
</pre>

<H3>Compiling wml</H3>
This assumes that you have wml installed on your machine.
Simply type <kbd>make</kbd>
in webwml/&lt;lang&gt;. The pages will be made in ../../debian.org from the
language directory. This is because that is where the .html files are relative
to the wml source on the master site (this is done so the pages can be mirrord
without the source). If any of the destination directories are missing, the
<kbd>make</kbd> will fail.

<p>Some languages may need special pre- or post-processing of the wml files
in order to handle the character set properly. This can be done by chaning
the line for WML in <kbd>webwml/&lt;lang&gt;/Make.lang</kbd> appropriately.

<H3>Special files and directories</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>News/</b><br>
This directory contains all the news items sent to debian-announce. The
news items are also used to create a list of the titles of the most recent 
news items for the main page. This is all done automatically using scripts.

<p>You may translate any news items you wish. It is expected that time
constraints will mean that only special items, such as the announcement of
a new release of Debian, will be translated. It is completely up to you
what you translate. The script that grabs news headlines to generate the
index page and the items for the main web page checks for translations of
news items and if it doesn't find one, uses the title from the english copy.

<li><b>security/</b><br>
This directory contains the status of all Debian related security problems
that have been reported. Indexes are created similarly to the News/ directory.
Translations are up to you.

<li><b>devel/people.wml</b><br>
This contains the list of package maintainers and what packages they maintain.
The list of names and packages is generated automatically and is kept in
webwml/english/devel/people.names. The only text in there that is english
specific is 'main', 'non-free', 'non-us', 'contrib' and 'homepage'.
If translators feel it is necessary, 'homepage' could be translated.
Send mail to debian-www if you would like this done.

<li><b>MailingLists/subscribe.wml and MailingLists/unsubscribe.wml</b><br>
These pages are generated automatically from scripts. Do not bother
translating these yet. A system for adding translations will be developerd.

<li><b>distrib/vendors/wml</b><br>
You may want to wait before translating this. A system is being developed
where the list of vendors is kept in a seperate data file in the english
directory. This file will contain the translations of the labels for each
vendor entry and a feature of wml will be used so each translation uses
the correct labels. This way, when the maintainer of the vendor list
adds a new vendor, all translations will see it immediately.
