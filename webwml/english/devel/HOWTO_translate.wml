<H1>HOWTO translate Debian pages</H1>

<P>Thanks you for helping to translate the Debian web pages.
Instead of having a number of different sites hosting language
specific versions of the web pages, it is hoped that people
will concentrate on keeping a primary site which will host the
translations of a common set of web pages.

<H3>Background</H3>
<P>All the hand written (non documentation) files on the web site are
generated using wml. They are stored on www.debian.org using CVS.
You will want to check out a local copy of the wml files to edit
on your home machine. When you are done making changes, you can then
release the changes back to www.debian.org. Once a day, the copy of
the repository on master will be updated. A Makefile is then run
on them to create the updated public web pages.

<H3>Using CVS</H3>
<P>In what follows anonymous access will be used as an example. If
you have access to another account which gives you write permission to
the repository then you should use that account instead.
To begin using CVS, you must first 'login' to the CVS server
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml login
</pre>
(just hit return for the password for anonymous)

<P>To check out a copy of the wml files on your local machine, you
need to use
<pre>
   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml checkout webwml/&lt;lang&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;lang&gt; is the language you want. You will probably want
the English version in addition to the language you are working on.

<P>From then on, you will not need to use the '-d :pserver:...' part
as the CVS/ directories contain the necessary information.
Every few days you will want to do a
<pre>
   cvs update
</pre>
to retrieve any files from the repository which have changed.

<P>The following is for those who have write permission on the repository.
When you are done with the page, you can commit your changes to the repository using
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit &lt;dir&gt;
</pre>
or
<pre>
   cvs commit          (to commit all changes in your copy)
</pre>

<P>If you are the first person translating a page, you need to do
<pre>
   cvs add &lt;file&gt;.wml
</pre>
before you release it.

<P>For more information on CVS, use 'info cvs'.

<H3>Translating Pages</H3>
<P>To make the job of the translators as easy as possible the
pages are generated a bit differently than many of
you will be used to. The web pages are actually generated
using source that is marked up with wml. There are
separate directories for each language. To translate to a
new language, someone must first translate the wml template
files (not a big job).

<P>Because of the way the web servers are set up, you should not
have to change any of the internal links. There are times when
you may want to make a change to the content when you are
translating. One example is on the support page; you will
probably want to include an example on subscribing to the
language specific mailing list, e.g. debian-french on the
French version of the pages. If you make any other changes,
please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
as it is desired to keep the content as similar as possible
between the different versions.

<P>The first time a page is translated, send a note to
<a href="mailto:debian-www@lists.debian.org">debian-www@lists.debian.org</a>
A script must be run on the pages to re-make the other language
versions so they will know about the new translation.

<P>I hope you find the work we've done will make translating
the pages as easy as possible.

<H3>How Does the Server Know Which File to Serve</H3>
<P>You will notice that internal links don't end in .html. This
is because the server is using content negotation to decide
which version of the document to deliver. When there is more
than one choice, the server will make a list of all possible
files to serve, e.g. if the request is for about, then the list
of completions might be about.html.en and about.html.de.
The default for Debian servers will be to serve the English
document, but it is configurable.

<P>If a client has the proper variable set, for example to serve German,
then in the example above about.html.de would be served. The
nice thing about this setup is that if the desired language is
not available, a different language will be delivered instead
(which hopefully is better than nothing). The decision on which
document is served is a bit confusing so instead of describing
it here, you should get the definitive answer from
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html">http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html</a>
if you are interested.

<P>Because many users will not even know of the existence of content-negotation,
there are links at the bottom of every page pointing directly
to the version of that page in every other language available.
This is computed using a perl script called by wml when the
page is generated. 

<H3>Example of Starting a Translation</H3>
French will be used for the example
<pre>
   cvs checkout webwml/english
   cd webwml
   mkdir french
   cvs add french
   cd french
   cp ../english/.wmlrc .
edit and change '-D CUR_LANG=English' to '-D CUR_LANG=French'
   cp ../english/Makefile .
edit and chenge 'LANG=en' to 'LANG=fr'
Also comment out every target after 'all:' except for the files which are translated
   cp -r ../english/template .
edit template/debian/* and translate any text

Finally, you can start translating the pages.
</pre>

<H3>Example of Translating a Page</H3>
A French of the social contract will be used for the example
<pre>
   cvs checkout webwml/english webwml/french
   cd webwml/french
   cp ../english/social_contract.wml .
   cvs add social_contract.wml
edit social_contract.wml and translate the text. Do not try to translate any
links or change them in any way.
When done
   cvs commit social_contract.wml
</pre>

<H3>Compiling wml</H3>
This assumes that you have wml installed on your machine.
Simply type
<pre>
   make
</pre>
in webwml/&lt;lang&gt;. The pages will be made in ../../debian.org from the
language directory. This is because that is where the .html files are relative
to the wml source on the master site. You will have to make that dir and any
needed subdirs or the Makefile will fail.

<P>The only dependency you need to be careful of is that the main page (index.html) depends
upon news.wml so you need to translate that first. If a translation team does not want
to translate news.wml then change the dependency in the Makefile to be ../english/news.wml
and change
<pre>
  open(FILEH, "&lt;news.wml");
</pre>
in template/debian/recent_news.wml to
<pre>
  open(FILEH, "&lt;../english/news.wml");
</pre>

<:= languages ("$(HOME)", "devel", "$(WML_SRC_BASENAME)", "$(CUR_LANG)") :>
