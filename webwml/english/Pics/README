You MUST have a Gimp Perl server running for this to work.
You have been (belatedly) warned!

You will need to install gimp1.1 and gimp1.1-nonfree packages (because we're
writing GIFs). gimp1.2 and gimp1.2-nonfree will work, too.

It is often a good idea to have gimp perl up and running so it is a lot
faster - select menu item Xtns->Perl->Server. To run the server from the
command line, issue this:

gimp --no-interface --no-data --batch '(extension-perl-server 0 0 0)' &

If you want to go into totally evil mode with no X display, try
this on for size. I hope it works :/

Xvfb :1 -screen 0 10x10x8 -pixdepths 1 &
gimp --display :1.0 --no-interface --no-data --batch '(extension-perl-server 0 0 0)' &

It may take a while for the server to start up, so wait a few seconds.

Then run make pics (in an x-terminal-emulator).
