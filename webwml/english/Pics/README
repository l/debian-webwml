This directory should contain navigation bar buttons on Debian web pages.
See ../../english/template/debian/navbar.wml for why.

Read /devel/website/navbar_images, too.

You MUST have a Gimp-Perl server running for this to work.
You have been (belatedly) warned!

You will need to install gimp1.2, gimp1.2-perl and gimp1.2-nonfree packages
(the latter is necessary because we're currently still writing GIFs).
If you are using the default Monotype Arial font, you will need to install
the "msttcorefonts" package too.

It is often a good idea to have Gimp-Perl up and running so it is a lot
faster - select menu item Xtns->Perl->Server.  To run the server from the
command line, issue this:

    gimp --no-interface --no-data --batch '(extension-perl-server 0 0 0)' &

If you want to go into totally evil mode with no X display, try
this on for size.  I hope it works :/

    Xvfb :1 -screen 0 10x10x8 -pixdepths 1 &
    gimp --display :1.0 --no-interface --no-data --batch '(extension-perl-server 0 0 0)' &

It may take a while for the server to start up, so wait a few seconds.

Then run "make pics" (in an x-terminal-emulator).
