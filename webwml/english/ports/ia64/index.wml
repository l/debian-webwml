<h1>Debian for IA-64</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>IA-64 will be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

<p>If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-ia64 mailing 
list.

<p>
An ISO image for creating a CDROM containing the Debian installation 
tools for IA-64 is available by HTTP from 
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-base-20011202-rc1.iso.gz">\
http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-base-20011202-rc1.iso.gz</a>, and by FTP from
<a href="ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-base-20011202-rc1.iso.gz">\
ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-base-20011202-rc1.iso.gz</a>.  
Please see the README.txt
in the root directory of the CD for platform-specific installation
instructions.
<p>
Please note that your EFI partition must be of type 'ef' for the installer
to run to completion.  Our user-space elilo script is checking for that and
the error message if it's wrong is less helpful than it could be.

<h2>BIOS Versions</h2>

Because IA-64 products and operating systems are all still evolving, it's quite
possible that you may find a machine with a BIOS version that doesn't work well
with Linux.  One particular combination we've heard about is trying to run new
kernels on "Lion" systems with old BIOS versions.  To try and make this easier,
here's what we know about current BIOS versions for each system type that the
Debian port is known to have been tested on.

Lion	HP i2000	99B	http://www.hp.com/cposupport/servers/software/HPLionBIOS99Firmware.exe.html

BigSur	HP rx4610	117C	http://www.hp.com/workstations/support/software/bios/system/117c/index.html

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>
The instigators of the IA-64 port were Bdale Garbee and Randolph Chung. 
The best way to ask questions now is via the mailing list.
