<h1>Debian for IA-64

<h2>Status</h2>

Debian's port to IA-64 is now self-hosting... but not really ready to be
installed on your hardware yet.

<p>

We hope to be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-ia64 mailing 
list when it gets created.
