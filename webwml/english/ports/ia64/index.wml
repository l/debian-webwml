<h1>Debian for IA-64</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
IA-64 will be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

<p>
If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-ia64 mailing 
list.

<p>
An ISO image for creating a CDROM containing the Debian installation 
tools for IA-64 is available by HTTP from 
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-net-20020506.iso">\
http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-net-20020506.iso</a>, and by FTP from
<a href="ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-net-20020506.iso">\
ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/ia64-net-20020506.iso</a>.  
Please see the README.txt
in the root directory of the CD for platform-specific installation
instructions.

<p>
The installer supports both GPT (recommended) and FAT disk partitioning.  If 
you choose to use FAT partitioning, make sure to set the partition type for
the EFI partition to 'ef', as directed in the help screen displayed just 
before partitioning starts.

<h2>BIOS Versions</h2>

<p>
Because IA-64 products and operating systems are all still evolving, it's quite
possible that you may find a machine with a BIOS version that doesn't work well
with Linux.  One particular combination we've heard about is trying to run new
kernels on "Lion" systems with old BIOS versions.  To try and make this easier,
here's what we know about BIOS versions that work for each system type that 
the Debian port is known to have been tested on.</p>

<ul>
<li> Lion, aka HP rx4610, version 99b works well.
<li> BigSur, aka HP i2000, version 117c works well.
</ul>

<p>
Firmware downloads for 
<a href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>
systems are available starting 
<a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/eng/software_drivers.htm"> HERE </a>.
</p>

<p>
If anyone has information about suitable BIOS versions for other IA-64 systems
that are successfully running Debian, let us know on the debian-ia64 list! </p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>
The instigators of the IA-64 port were Bdale Garbee and Randolph Chung. 
The best way to ask questions now is via the mailing list.
