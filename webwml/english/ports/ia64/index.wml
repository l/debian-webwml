<h1>Debian for IA-64</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
IA-64 has been a supported supported Debian architecture since Debian 3.0 (woody)

<p>
If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the
<a href="#mailinglist">debian-ia64 mailing list</a>.

<p>
The normal Debian channels for acquiring installation media now include
ia64 CD images.

<p>
Another possibility is to use one of the beta-release 
<a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a>
images for ia64.  This could be more of an adventure, but any problems you 
find and report will help Debian get debian-installer on ia64 tested and ready 
for the next stable Debian release!

<h2>BIOS Versions</h2>

<p>
It's possible that you may find an early ia64 machine that needs a BIOS 
upgrade to work well with Linux.
One particular combination we've heard about is trying to run new
kernels on "Lion" systems with really old BIOS versions.  
To try and make this easier,
here's what we know about BIOS versions that work well for Debian on older
ia64 systems:

<ul>
<li> Lion, aka HP rx4610, version 99b works well.
<li> BigSur, aka HP i2000, version 130 works well.
</ul>

<p>
Firmware downloads for 
<a href="http://www.hp.com">HP</a>
systems are available starting 
<a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/eng/software_drivers.htm"> HERE </a>.
</p>

<p>
If anyone has information about suitable BIOS versions for other IA-64 systems
that are successfully running Debian, let us know on the debian-ia64 list! </p>

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>
The instigators of the IA-64 port were Bdale Garbee and Randolph Chung. 
The best way to ask questions now is via the mailing list.
