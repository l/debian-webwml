<h1>Debian for IA-64</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>We hope to be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

<p>If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-ia64 mailing 
list.

<p>Installation media is available in the woody/testing tree in the disks-ia64
directory.  There are no real docs for this yet, but if you have ever been
through a Debian install before and have access to an IA-64 system... go for
it!
