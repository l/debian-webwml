<h1>Debian for IA-64</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>IA-64 will be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

<p>If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-ia64 mailing 
list.

<p>
An ISO image for creating a CDROM containing the Debian installation 
tools for IA-64 is now available by HTTP from 
<a href="http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz">\
http://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz</a>, and by FTP from
<a href="ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz">\
ftp://gluck.debian.org/ia64/cd-20010810.iso.gz</a>.  Please see the README.txt
in the root directory of the CD for platform-specific installation
instructions.
<p>
Please note that your EFI partition must be of type 'ef' for the installer
to run to completion.  Our user-space elilo script is checking for that and
the error message if it's wrong is less helpful than it could be.

<h2>Contacts</h2>

<p>
The instigators of the IA-64 port were Bdale Garbee and Randolph Chung. 
The best way to ask questions now is via the mailing list.
