<h1>Glibc-based Debian GNU/FreeBSD</h1>

<p>Glibc-based Debian GNU/FreeBSD is a port that consists of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU userland</a> using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/">GNU C library</a> on top
of <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>'s kernel and kernel-related
utilities, coupled with the regular <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">\
Debian package set</a>. The port is currently
based on i386 architecture only.</p>

<p><i>Last updated June 9th 2003</i></p>

<p>The GNU C library was ported to the FreeBSD kernel by Bruno Haible. See
<url "http://www.haible.de/bruno/gnu-freebsd/"> for details.<br>
(Note that most patches there are outdated, and more
recent versions are either applied upstream, applied in debian packages, or in
my <a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/patches/">patch directory</a>.)
</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>The base system is self-hosting and mostly functional. I have put a base
tarball for download, see the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/pub/">public directory</a>.
</p>

<p>You can use that tarball to obtain a fully self-hosting GNU/FreeBSD
installation, by following the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/pub/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
instructions.</p>

<p>There's a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2003/debian-bsd-200306/msg00004.html">\
public APT repository</a>. You can use the base system in the tarball to fetch
packages from it. Most essential stuff (build-essential, xfree86, etc.) is in
the archive.</p>

<h2>How to help</h2>

<p>There's a very large amount of packages that need fixing. Luckily, because
we use Glibc the portability problems are very simple and most times it's
just a matter of copying a test case for "*-freebsd*-gnu*" from another
Glibc-based system (like GNU or GNU/Linux).</p>

<p>If you want to help porting packages, look at my
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/patches/">patches</a> directory
first to ensure you don't repeat already done work. (Please don't submit
patches from my directory, many of them are not ready to be sent.)</p>

<p>We are also looking for a maintainer of the Glibc port. If you are capable
and willing to help on this, please contact us and the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/">Glibc maintainers</a>.
Bruno Haible (author of the initial Glibc port) might be interested to hear
about it, too.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/gnu-freebsd/tasks/">tasks</a>
dir for more details on what needs to be done.</p>
