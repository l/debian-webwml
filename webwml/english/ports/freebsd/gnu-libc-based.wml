<h1>Glibc-based Debian GNU/KFreeBSD</h1>

<p>Glibc-based Debian GNU/KFreeBSD is a port that consists of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU userland</a> using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/glibc/">GNU C library</a> on top of
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>'s kernel, coupled with the
regular <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">Debian package set</a>.</p>

<p>The GNU C library was ported to FreeBSD's kernel by Bruno Haible. In order
to continue Bruno's work, the
<a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/glibc-bsd/">Glibc-BSD project</a>
was started at <a href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">Savannah</a> to maintain the
*BSD ports of Glibc until they're ready to be integrated in upstream's Glibc
sources.</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>The base system is self-hosting and mostly functional. I have put a base
tarball for download, see the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/kfreebsd/pub/">public directory</a>.
</p>

<p>You can use that tarball to obtain a fully self-hosting GNU/KFreeBSD
installation, by following the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/kfreebsd/pub/INSTALL">INSTALL</a>
instructions.</p>

<p>There's a <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2003/debian-bsd-200306/msg00004.html">
public APT repository</a>. You can use the base system in the tarball to fetch
packages from it. Most essential stuff (build-essential, xfree86, etc.) is in
the archive.</p>

<h2>How to help</h2>

<p>There's a very large amount of packages that need fixing. Luckily, because
we use Glibc the portability problems are very simple and most times it's
just a matter of copying a test case for "k*bsd*-gnu" from another Glibc-based
system (like GNU or GNU/Linux).</p>

<p>If you want to help porting packages, look at my
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/kfreebsd/patches/">patches</a> directory
first to ensure you don't repeat already done work. (Please don't submit
patches from my directory, many of them are not ready to be sent.)</p>

<p>The <a href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/glibc-bsd/">Glibc-BSD
project</a> is also looking for contributors for maintaining the Glibc port
for FreeBSD's kernel. See <url "http://www.nongnu.org/glibc-bsd/#2"> for
details.</p>

<p>See the <a href="http://people.debian.org/~rmh/kfreebsd/tasks/">tasks</a>
directory for more details on what needs to be done.</p>
