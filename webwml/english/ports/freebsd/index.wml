<h1>Debian GNU/FreeBSD</h1>

<p>There are currently two separate efforts for building a Debian distribution
based on FreeBSD's kernel. Both are work in progress in experimental stage,
and we have not fully decided yet which of them will become the official
Debian GNU/FreeBSD. See the corresponding port sites for details on the
status of each port:
</p>

<p>
Debian GNU/FreeBSD <a href="gnu-libc-based">based on GNU C library (Glibc)</a>
</p>

<p>
Debian GNU/FreeBSD <a href="bsd-libc-based">based on BSD C library (libc5)</a>
</p>
