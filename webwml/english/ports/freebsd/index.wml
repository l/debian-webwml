<p>Debian GNU/FreeBSD is a port that consists of a
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> kernel, kernel-related
utilities, C Library and a few specific utilities, coupled with the
"regular" Debian (GNU) userland. The port is currently based on Intel
x86 architecture only.</p>

<p>The primary port maintainer is Nathan Hawkins.</p>

<p>There were packages available but the public copy is no longer
available due to a <a href="$(HOME)/News/2002/20021122">server lost
in fire</a>. Due to this and some other unfortunate circumstances,
the progress on the port is presently stalled.</p>

<p>Please refer to the closely related <a href="../netbsd/">NetBSD</a> port
page for more historic information.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p><i>Last updated 4/22/2002</i></p>

<p>The key parts of FreeBSD are packaged, and ready to for upload. I am
holding it until after crypto is in main, at which time it will be uploaded
to experimental until woody is released.</p>

<p>The base system is mostly functional, however there are several
outstanding issues:</p>

<h3>Problems with specific packages</h3>

<ul>
    <li>sysvinit is patched and working, but there are problems getting the
	patches into a state where they can be merged without breaking Linux.
    </li>
    <li>shadow is badly hacked, and needs major work.
	<i><b>Update: Did some major work. The situation is almost decent
	now. Needs more testing.</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>apt-get segfaults a lot. It seems to work most of the time on source
	packages, but fails reliably for binaries.
	<i><b>Update: this is fixed now</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>groff: won't build the current version, due to internationalization
	problem with libc.
	<i><b>Update: fixed when langinfo.h was MFC'ed.</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>gcc/binutils: something is keeping gcc -g from actually including
	debugging information. It's probably binutils, and it probably has
	some other things wrong with it.
	<i><b>Update: working now. strange...</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>util-linux: total basket case. I gave up and made a new package,
	util-bsd.
    </li>
    <li>e2fsprogs: doesn't build, probably isn't going to anytime soon.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>General problems with the port</h3>

<ul>
    <li>libc doesn't contain -lintl. A lot of packages don't check for this,
	and every one requires patching.
    </li>
    <li>getopt and some other -liberty functions aren't in libc. A lot of
	the Debian-specific packages are broken by this.
	<i><b>Update: I ported the NetBSD getopt_long over, and it seems to
	work fine. Looks like this one may be solved.</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>No multi-byte character set functions. Breaks building UTF support
	in libncurses, and some other packages.
	<i><b>Update: libiconv is packaged. It may make a difference
	here.</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>Totally different implementation of shadow passwords. BSD 4.4
	apparently introduced an incompatible way of doing it. It may
	actually be better, but there are no standard library functions for
	dealing with it. getspnam and friends don't exist.
	<i><b>Update: this is fixed. I wrote a library, libshadow, and it
	solved the problem.</b></i>
    </li>
    <li>Use of libc6-dev in package build deps. This needs to stop!
    </li>
    <li>Use of gcc 3.0. This should become less of a problem, as other
	ports are based on it.
    </li>
    <li>Need a unique host type for configure. FreeBSD configurations are
	sometimes wrong for Debian, and it would be nice to be able to avoid
	breaking FreeBSD with changes for Debian. The biggest problem is with
	libtool.</li>
</ul>
