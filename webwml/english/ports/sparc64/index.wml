<h1>Debian SPARC 64 Port</h1>

  <p>
You can run Debian on the sun4u (SPARC 64) architectures using the
released <a href="../../releases/stable/">stable</a> distribution.
Just use the SPARC architecture with the supplied 64-bit Sun4u
kernels.  You'll be running with a 64-bit kernel, but all applications
will be 32-bit (although you won't notice the difference).  Most of
the Debian SPARC distribution was compiled on Sun4u machines.
  <p>
For more information, errata, and status, see the
<a href="../sparc/">Debian SPARC</a> port pages.
