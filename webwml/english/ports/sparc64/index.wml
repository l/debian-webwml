<h2><a name="intro">Overview</a></h2>
  <p>
You can run Debian on the Sun4u (SPARC 64) architectures using the
released <a href="../../releases/stable/">stable</a> distribution.
Just use the SPARC architecture with the supplied 64-bit Sun4u
kernels.  You'll be running with a 64-bit kernel, but all applications
will be 32-bit (although you won't notice the difference).  Most of
the Debian SPARC distribution was compiled on Sun4u machines.
  <p>
For more information, errata, and status, see the <a
href="../sparc/">Debian SPARC Port</a> pages.
  <p>
The Debian SPARC 64 (a.k.a., ``UltraLinux'') porting effort is not
currently conceived as a full porting effort like other ports.
Rather, it is intended to be an <em>add-on</em> to the <a
href="../sparc/">Debian SPARC Port</a>.
  <p>
In fact, there is really no point in having all applications running
in 64-bit mode.  Full 64-bit mode involves a significant overhead
(memory and disk size) with often no benefit.  Some applications
really can benefit from being in 64-bit mode, and that is the purpose
of this porting effort.


<h2><a name="status">Status</a></h2>
  <p>
Work is still being done on the fundamental tool-chain.  GNU libc
seems to be close to being ready; <tt>egcs</tt> suffers some problems,
especially with some floating-point functions (get it now as
<tt>egcs64</tt>); <tt>binutils</tt> is ready.  The Linux kernel itself
purportedly has some issues with 64-bit binaries as well.  We expect
to have this work integrated by the end of summer.
  <p>
An accelerated X server for Creator cards will integrated into the
mainstream distribution Real Soon Now!

  <p>
Until all the apparatus is in place for compiling 64-bit applications,
there is as yet no point in having a ``sparc64'' architecture listed
in the Debian archive.
  <p>
However, once we <em>are</em> ready for this, there is still the
fundamental problem of how to manage a <em>selective</em> archive.
That is, most applications receive no benefit from being 64-bit, thus
they will continue to be ``borrowed'' from the <a href="../sparc/">\
SPARC port</a>.  This poses unique archive management and distribution
problems which have not yet been fully worked out.



<h2><a name="kernel">Compiling Kernels for Sun4u</a></h2>
  <p>
<strong>NOTE:</strong> Due to problems in the current <tt>egcs64</tt>,
you will have problems running late model 2.2.x kernels.  We suggest,
for now, that you use the stock kernel images provided in the
``unstable'' sparc distribution.
  <p>
To compile a Linux kernel for Sun4u, you'll need to use the Linux 2.2
source tree.  You must also install the <tt>egcs64</tt> package.
  <p>
We highly suggest you also use the <tt>kernel-package</tt> package to
help with the installation and management of kernels.  You can compile
a configured kernel in one command (as root):
<pre>
  make-kpkg --subarch=sun4u --arch_in_name --revision=custom.1 kernel_image
</pre>
