<h1>Status about Debian for ARM</h1>

<ul>

<li><strong>Corel/Rebel NetWinder</strong>

<p>It was the NetWinder that originally inspired this port and NetWinder people
(especially Jim Pick) who did most of the initial work, so not surprisingly,
support is basically complete. You should be able to install from a standard
Debian-arm 2.2 CD set. If you have a really old NeTTrom then you may need an
update for an easy life.

<li><strong>Acorn RiscPC and other Acorn/RISCOS machines</strong>

<p>The Acorn RiscPC support is nearing completion. The boot-floppies
installation in 2.2r0 doesn't work, but you can get a version that does
work from <a
href="ftp://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/armlinux/people/chocks/">Peter Naulls'
armlinux stuff</a> (right now) or from <A
HREF="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/armlinux/riscos/">Aleph One</A> on CD (in
October 2000). This support should be in the main Debian-ARM archive for
2.2r2.
<p>
Currently you need a StrongARM RiscPC for everything to work properly, but
remaining problems for ARM6 and ARM7 RiscPCs should be ironed out soon.
<p>
Riscstation (7500FE-based) support is currently being worked on and is expected to reach a
useable state quite soon. 
<p> 
Mico's, A7000s (7500FE-based) and Imagos (StrongARM-based) are not yet 
supported, but should be in due course.
<p>
Older ARM3 Acorn machines (A5000, A4, A4x0, A5x0) are not yet supported as
they need things compiled for 26-bit mode. This is being sorted and some
reasonable level of support should be possible.

<li><strong>ARM-based PDAs</strong>

<p>
There are now several of these available and some of them can run Linux.
However there is no direct support for these in Debian boot-floppies yet,
but once you have got started the Debian packages should work and be useful. 
<p> 
Support currently exists for the <a href="http://www.calcaria.net/">Psion Series 5 (and Geofox 1)</a><br> and <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/Compaq/iPAQH3600/">Compaq iPAQ H3600</a>.
<p>
There is a project to support later Psion machines <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-7110/">(5mx, 5mxPro and Series 7)</a>, but due to a lack of information from Psion this is not proceeding very fast.

<li><strong>ARM Development boards</strong>

<p>
There are now lots of ARM development boards of various types available. Most
of them have some sort of support available, but again none are yet supported
by boot-floppies. <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Emdebian</a> exists to
help fit Debian into these smaller devices, but the standard Debian archive
can also be useful in conjuction with various device-specific tools for
getting started in the first place. Many of these devices are only properly supported by kernel 2.4.
