<p><strong>Chris Rutter was killed in a tragic car accident</strong>

<p>The Debian project mourns the loss of Chris Rutter, and the next
ARM release will be dedicated to him.  See the <a
href="$(HOME)/News/2001/20010402b">press release</a>.

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-08-19"):></h3>

<p><strong>Debian ARM autobuilder running</strong>

<p>Chris Rutter set up a properly integrated autobuilder to keep the ARM 
packages up to date (sponsored by <a href="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/armlinux/">Aleph One</a>).

<p><strong>NetWinder booted for the first time</strong>

<p>
Woo hoo! With the help of the recently released NeTTrom 2.0.1 flash
upgrade, it is now possible to boot directly into Debian installed
on a partition (instead of booting Red Hat, and using a chroot
image). Several packages need to be uploaded with the
fixes - stay tuned.

<p><strong>Debian NetWinder chroot image</strong>

<p>
Jim Pick prepared an image of the Debian base system that can
be easily installed into a directory on a NetWinder, and used as a
chroot environment - without affecting the software that Corel
supplies.

<p><strong>Mini-status report:</strong>

<p>
We've uploaded many packages officially, and they are now available on any
Debian mirror in the <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/sid/">dists/sid</a>
(pre-release) directory.

<p>Almost all of the Corel-supplied binaries have been replaced, and we have
successfully been able to remove ld.so.1 and termcap from the system.
Package count: 60 binary packages in "main".

<p>The mailing list has been moved to lists.debian.org and it is now an
"open" list.
