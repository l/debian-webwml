<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the ARM architecture which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/release-notes/">\
release notes</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/install">\
installation manual</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The <a href="status">status</a> and <a href="links">links</a> web pages
contain a few bits of useful information about the port. There's also
<a href="news">news</a> which are not updated often, and a very much
obsolete <a href="softwaremap">software map</a>.</p>

<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>
There are currently 4 ARM computers available. These are
debussy.debian.org, elara.debian.org, europa.debian.org, and rameau.debian.org.
</p>

<p>
The autobuilders (buildds) are elara, europa and rameau. If you want
to do any development work, you should consider debussy. If you are
a regular Debian developer you have access as with any other debian.org
computer.</p>
<p>
You will be able to use the three chroot environments: oldstable (potato),
stable (woody) and unstable (sid). You can use the
<em>dchroot &lt;env&gt;</em> program to access them.<br>

<h2>Dedication</h2>

<p>Chris Rutter &lt;<a href="mailto:chris@armlinux.org">chris@armlinux.org</a>&gt;

port got killed in a car accident. We dedicate the ARM port's
release in the Debian GNU/Linux ``woody'' distribution to his
memory.
