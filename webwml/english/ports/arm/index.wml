<toc-add-entry name="about">Debian on arm</toc-add-entry>
<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM
architecture</a> which is often found in embedded systems.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="status">Current Status</toc-add-entry>
<p>Debian fully supports three ports to different flavours of
little-endian ARM hardware:</p>

<ul>

<li>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">ARM EABI</a>
(armel) port targets a range of older 32-bit ARM devices, particularly
those used in NAS hardware and a variety of *plug computers.</li>

<li>The newer <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatPort">ARM
hard-float</a> (armhf) port supports newer, more powerful 32-bit
devices using version 7 of the ARM architecture specification.</li>

<li>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/Arm64Port">64-bit ARM</a>
(arm64) port supports the latest 64-bit ARM-powered devices.</li>

</ul>

<p>Other ports to ARM hardware exist / have existed in and around
Debian - see <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/ArmPorts">the wiki</a>
for more links and an overview.</p>

<p>For a full and up-to-date list of the different hardware supported
by each of the ports, check the respective wiki pages. New ARM devices
are released every week, and it's easier for people to keep
information updated there.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="availablehw">Available Hardware for Debian Developers</toc-add-entry>
<p>Multiple machines are made available to Debian developers for ARM
porting work: abel.debian.org (armel/armhf), asachi.debian.org
(armhf/arm64) and harris.debian.org (armhf). The machines have
development chroot environments which you can access with
<em>schroot</em>.  Please see the <a
href="https://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">machine database</a> for
more information about these machines.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="dedication">Dedication</toc-add-entry>

<p>Chris Rutter 
who was the Project Coordinator and Autobuilder Coordinator for Debian ARM
port got killed in a car accident. We dedicate the ARM port's
release in the Debian GNU/Linux <q>woody</q> distribution to his
memory.</p>
