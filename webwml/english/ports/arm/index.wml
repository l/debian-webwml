<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the ARM architecture which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<h1>NEWS</h1>

<h3>24. 3. 2003</h3>

<p>The buildds have moved! :-) Europa and Elara live with <a
href="http://www.blueairnetworks.com">Blueair Networks</a>, thanks to
Ralph Siemsen and Andrew Mileski to offer hosting them there. And finally
Rameau will go over the big pond to James Troup in the upcoming 1-2 weeks.
If that's done everything should be back to normal.<br>
Having said that, there is still a backlog, so don't be surprised if your
packages take a bit longer.</p>

<h3>6. 1. 2003</h3>

<p>You can find us now on IRC on <samp>irc.debian.org</samp> on the channel
<samp>#debian-arm</samp>.</p>

<h2>General Information about ARM</h2>

<p>Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/release-notes/">\
release notes</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/install">\
installation manual</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The <a href="status">status</a> and <a href="links">links</a> web pages
contain a few bits of useful information about the port. There's also
<a href="news">news</a> which are not updated often, and a very much
obsolete <a href="softwaremap">software map</a>.</p>

<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>
There are currently 4 ARM computers available. These are
debussy.debian.org, elara.debian.org, europa.debian.org, and rameau.debian.org.
There is also netwinder.gag.com from our dear DPL Bdale Garbee but which
has restricted access to the ARM buildd maintainer and Bdale himself.
</p>

<p>
The autobuilders (buildds) are elara, europa, rameau and netwinder.gag.com.
If you want to do any development work, you should consider debussy. If you are
a regular Debian developer you have access as with any other debian.org
computer.</p>
<p>
You will be able to use the three chroot environments: oldstable (potato),
stable (woody) and unstable (sid). You can use the
<em>dchroot &lt;env&gt;</em> program to access them.<br>
For any inquiries mail <email "debian-admin@lists.debian.org">.</p>

<h2>Dedication</h2>

<p>Chris Rutter &lt;<a href="mailto:chris@armlinux.org">chris@armlinux.org</a>&gt;

port got killed in a car accident. We dedicate the ARM port's
release in the Debian GNU/Linux ``woody'' distribution to his
memory.
