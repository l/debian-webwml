<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM architecture</a>
which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Debian fully supports a port to little-endian ARM. The <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">ARM EABI</a> (armel) port has
been integrated in Debian and the old (arm) port is deprecated.</p>

<p>As of our latest release, Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_squeeze>,
the following ARM sub-architectures are fully supported:</p>

<ul>

<li>iop32x: we support some <a
href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/">IOP32x based Network Attached
Storage</a> (NAS) devices, such as the Thecus N2100, Intel SS4000 and GLAN
Tank.</li>

<li>ixp4xx: we support the popular
<a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/">Linksys NSLU2</a> device.</li>

<li>kirkwood: we support Marvell's Kirkwood platform and we have specific
support for a number of devices, including the <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/sheevaplug/">SheevaPlug</a>, <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/qnap/">QNAP Turbo NAS</a> (TS-11x,
TS-21x and TS-41x) and <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/kirkwood/openrd/">OpenRD</a>.</li>

<li>orion5x: we support Marvell's Orion platform and we have specific
support for a number of devices, including the <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/">QNAP Turbo Station</a> (TS-109,
TS-209, TS-409) and <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/hp/mv2120/">HP mv2120</a>.</li>

</ul>
