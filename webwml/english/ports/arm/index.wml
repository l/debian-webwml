<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM architecture</a>
which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Debian fully supports a port to little-endian ARM.  Unofficial ports
to <a href="http://armeb.debian.net/debian-armeb/">big-endian ARM</a>
(armeb) and
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">ARM EABI</a>
are underway.</p>

<p>As of our latest release, Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 (sarge), the following
ARM sub-architectures are supported:</p>

<ul>

<li>bast</li>
<li>lart</li>
<li>netwinder</li>
<li>riscpc</li>
<li>riscstation</li>

</ul>

<p>Currently, work is being done to add support for a number of new
sub-architectures.  For version 4.0 of Debian (known as etch), we intend to
support:</p>

<ul>

<li>netwinder (footbridge): we fully support Netwinder machines and
Simtec's CATS evaluation board.</li>

<li>iop32x: we intend to support some <a
href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/">IOP32x based Network Attached
Storage</a> (NAS) devices, such as the Thecus N2100 and GLAN Tank.</li>

<li>ixp4xx: we support the popular <a
href="http://cyrius.com/debian/nslu2">Linksys NSLU2</a> device.</li>

<li>rpc: we provide a kernel and incomplete debian-installer support but
this platform lacks testing.</li>

<li>s3c2410: we provide a kernel but there is no integration with
debian-installer.</li>

</ul>


<h2>General Information about ARM</h2>

<p>Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/release-notes/">\
release notes</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/">\
installation manual</a> for more information.</p>


<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>

agnesi.debian.org and leisner.debian.org are available to Debian
developers for ARM porting work.  Please see the <a
href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">machine database</a> for more
information about these machines.  In general, you will be able to use
the three chroot environments: stable (sarge), testing (etch) and
unstable (sid). You can use the <em>dchroot</em> program to access
them. For any inquiries mail <email "debian-admin@lists.debian.org">.</p>
