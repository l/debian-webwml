<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM architecture</a>
which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Debian fully supports a port to little-endian ARM (arm). The new
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">ARM EABI</a> (armel)
port is currently being integrated in Debian, and porters are working
to get it included in the next Debian Release (Lenny). The plan
is to deprecate old (arm) port in favour of of (armel) port after
Lenny release.</p>

<p>As of our latest release, Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_etch>,
the following ARM sub-architectures are fully supported:</p>

<ul>

<li>footbridge: we fully support Netwinder machines and
Simtec's CATS evaluation board</li>

<li>iop32x: we support some
<a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/">IOP32x based Network Attached
Storage</a> (NAS) devices, such as the Thecus N2100 and GLAN Tank</li>

<li>ixp4xx: we support the popular
<a href="http://cyrius.com/debian/nslu2">Linksys NSLU2</a> device.</li>

</ul>

<p>Some sub-architectures have partial or incomplete support:</p>

<ul>

<li>rpc: we provide a kernel and incomplete debian-installer support but
this platform lacks testing.</li>

<li>s3c2410: we provide a kernel but there is no integration with
debian-installer.</li>

</ul>


<h2>General Information about ARM</h2>

<p>Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/release-notes/">\
release notes</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/">\
installation manual</a> for more information.</p>


<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>agnesi.debian.org and leisner.debian.org are available to Debian
developers for ARM porting work.  Please see the <a
href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">machine database</a> for more
information about these machines.  In general, you will be able to use
the three chroot environments: stable (sarge), testing (etch) and
unstable (sid). You can use the <em>dchroot</em> program to access
them. For any inquiries mail <email "debian-admin@lists.debian.org">.</p>
