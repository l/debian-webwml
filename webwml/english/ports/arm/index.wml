<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on ARM</h1>

<p>On these pages you'll find information about the ongoing effort of
porting Debian GNU/Linux to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM architecture</a>
which is often found
in embedded systems.</p>

<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>Debian fully supports a port to little-endian ARM. The <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmEabiPort">ARM EABI</a> (armel) port has
been integrated in Debian and the old (arm) port is deprecated.</p>

<p>As of our latest release, Debian GNU/Linux <current_release_lenny>,
the following ARM sub-architectures are fully supported:</p>

<ul>

<li>footbridge: we fully support Netwinder machines and
Simtec's CATS evaluation board</li>

<li>iop32x: we support some
<a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/iop/">IOP32x based Network Attached
Storage</a> (NAS) devices, such as the Thecus N2100 and GLAN Tank</li>

<li>ixp4xx: we support the popular
<a href="http://www.cyrius.com/debian/nslu2/">Linksys NSLU2</a> device.</li>

<li>orion5x: we support Marvell's new Orion platform and we have specific
support for a number of devices, including the <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/qnap/">QNAP Turbo Station</a> (TS-109,
TS-209, TS-409) and <a href =
"http://www.cyrius.com/debian/orion/hp/mv2120/">HP mv2120</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>General Information about ARM</h2>

<p>Please see the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/release-notes/">\
release notes</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/arm/">\
installation manual</a> for more information.</p>


<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>agnesi.debian.org (arm) and agricola.debian.org (armel) are available
to Debian developers for ARM porting work. The machine have development
chroot environments which you can access with <em>dchroot</em>.  Please
see the <a href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">machine database</a>
for more information about these machines.</p>
