<h1>Debian-ARM</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p><ul>
  <li><strong>Corel/Rebel NetWinder</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>It was the Netwinder that originally inspired this port and netwinder people
(especially Jim Pick) who did most of the initial work, so not surprisingly,
support is basically complete. You should be able to install from a standard
Debian-arm 2.2 CD set. If you have a really old NetRom then you may need an
update for an easy life.
</blockquote>

<p><ul>
<li><strong>Acorn RiscPC and other Acorn/RISCOS machines</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The Acorn RiscPC support is nearing completion. The boot-floppies
installation in 2.2r0 doesn't work, but you can get a version that does
work from <a
href="ftp://ftp.arm.linux.org.uk/pub/armlinux/people/chocks/">Peter Naulls'
armlinux stuff</a> (right now) or from <A
HREF="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/armlinux/riscos/">Aleph One</A> on CD (in
October 2000). This support should be in the main Debian-ARM archive for
2.2r2.
<p>
Currently you need a StrongARM Risc PC for everything to work properly, but
remaining problems for ARM6 and ARM7 Risc PCs should be ironed out soon.
<p>
Riscstation (7500FE-based) support is currently being worked on and is expected to reach a
useable state quite soon. 
<p> 
Mico's, A7000s (7500FE-based) and Imagos (StrongARM-based) are not yet 
supported, but should be in due course.
<p>
Older ARM3 Acorn machines (A5000, A4, A4x0, A5x0) are not yet supported as
they need things compiled for 26-bit mode. This is being sorted and some
reasonable level of support should be possible.
</blockquote>

<p><ul>
<li><strong>ARM-based PDAs</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are now several of these available and some of them can run Linux.
However there is no direct support for these in Debian boot-floppies yet,
but once you have got started the Debian packages should work and be useful. 
<p> 
Support currently exists for the <a href="http://www.calcaria.net/">Psion Series 5 (and Geofox 1)</a><br> and <a href="http://www.handhelds.org/Compaq/iPAQH3600/">Compaq iPAQ H3600</a>.
<p>
There is a project to support later Psion machines <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/linux-7110/">(5mx, 5mxPro and Series 7)</a>, but due to a lack of information from Psion this is not proceeding very fast.
</blockquote>

<p><ul>
  <li><strong>ARM Development boards</strong></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>
There are now lots of ARM development boards of various types available. Most
of them have some sort of support available, but again none are yet supported
by boot-floppies. <a href="http://www.emdebian.org/">Emdebian</a> exists to
help fit Debian into these smaller devices, but the standard Debian archive
can also be useful in conjuction with various device-specific tools for
getting started in the first place. Many of these devices are only properly supported by kernel 2.4.

<h2>Timeline</h2>

<dl>
<dt><em>August 19, 2000</em> - <strong>Debian ARM autobuilder running</strong>
<dd>
Chris Rutter set up a properly integrated autobuilder to keep the ARM 
packages up to date (sponsored by <a href="http://www.aleph1.co.uk/armlinux/">Aleph One</a>).

<br>&nbsp;

<dt><em>??, 1999</em> - <strong>Acorn Risc PC Booted for the first time</strong>
<dd>
When did this happen? - and who did it? - Peter Naulls?

<br>&nbsp;

<dt><em>October 4, 1998</em> - <strong>Netwinder Booted for the first time</strong>
<dd>
Woo hoo! With the help of the recently release NettROM 2.0.1 flash
upgrade, it is now possible to boot directly into Debian installed
on a partition (instead of booting Red Hat, and using a chroot
image). Several packages need to be uploaded with the
fixes - stay tuned.

<br>&nbsp;

<dt><em>August 11, 1998</em> - <strong>Debian NetWinder chroot image</strong>
<dd>
Jim Pick prepared an image of the Debian base system that can
be easily installed into a directory on a NetWinder, and used as a
chroot environment - without affecting the software that Corel
supplies.
<br>&nbsp;
<dt><em>August 1, 1998</em> - <strong>Mini-status report:</strong>
<dd>
We've uploaded many packages officially, and they are now available on any
Debian mirror in the <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/sid/">dists/sid</a>
(pre-release) directory.

<p>Almost all of the Corel-supplied binaries have been replaced, and we have
successfully been able to remove ld.so.1 and termcap from the system.
Package count: 60 binary packages in "main".

<p>The mailing list has been moved to lists.debian.org and it is now an
"open" list.

<h3>Mailing List</h3>

The mailing list is now located at lists.debian.org - send a message

<h2>Dedication</h2>

<p>Chris Rutter &lt;<a href="mailto:chris@armlinux.org">chris@armlinux.org</a>&gt;
who was the Project Coordinator and Autobuilder Coordinator for Debian ARM
port recently got killed in a car accident. We will dedicate the ARM port's
release in the upcoming Debian GNU/Linux ``woody'' distribution to his
memory.
