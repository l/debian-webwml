#    1 Jan 1999 - v0.0 <Marcus.Brinkmann@ruhr-uni-bochum.de>
#        Original created by Marcus Brinkmann.
#   14 Jan 1999 - v0.1 Matthew Vernon <mcv21@cam.ac.uk>
#        Edited to deal with the removal of the /usr -> / symlink
#        This should work with or without the symlink
#   17 Feb 1999 - v1.0 Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>
#        Create /etc/fstab.
#   27 Apr 1999 - v1.1 Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>
#        Make it work with latest packages, libc needs awk configured.
#    5 Mar 1999 - v1.2 Marcus Brinkmann <brinkmd@debian.org>
#        We need /dev/fd early for calling #! scripts outside of our PATH.
#   13 May 1999 - v1.3
#        Add -v option to MAKEDEV, so we can watch progress.
#   17 May 1999 - v1.4
#        Shufle around the order of initial commands. Esp, copy
#        the password file before invoking MAKEDEV fd, before
#        calling dpkg first time.
#        Also, insert special calls to dpkg for missing dependencies.
#   27 May 1999 - v1.5
#        Explain how to reboot.
#    1 Jun 1999 - v2.0
#        Next generation. We create three crash servers and link to the
#        default. Requires hurd-19990529 at least.
#        Make pfinet point to dummy interface, so localhost works. Does only
#        work with Marks patch to GNU Mach.
