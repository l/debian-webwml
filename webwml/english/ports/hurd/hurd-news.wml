<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>News</h2>
<h3>27 Jul 1999</h3>
<p>
New packages of the core system are finished now. The Hurd has a new way to
boot (the part that happens after init is started), take a look at
<code>/libexec/runsystem</code>. This is useful for the
<code>sysvinit</code> package, which is almost done. Fixed a buglet in GNU
Lib C and one in GNU Mach. Autodetection of all network cards should work
now, but maybe we need to tweak the order a bit (3c5x9 before 3c59x).</p>

<h3>22 Jul 1999</h3>
<p>
<code>cpio 2.4.2-25</code> fixes the remaining Hurd compatibilty issue and
can now be compiled without changes. Thanks Brian!</p>

<h3>5 Jul 1999</h3>
<P>
Perl 5.005.03 patches submitted to the maintainer. The upstream code was
already clean (thanks, Mark!), but the Debian packaging scripts were linux
specific.
