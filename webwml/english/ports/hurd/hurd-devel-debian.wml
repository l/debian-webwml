<h3>
Porting Debian Packages</h3>
<p>
If you want to help the Debian GNU/Hurd port, you should make yourself
familiar with the Debian packaging system.  Once you have done this by
reading the available documentation and visiting the <a
href="$(HOME)/devel/">Developer's Corner</a> you should know how to
extract Debian source packages and build a Debian package. Here is a
crash course for the very lazy people:</p>

<h3>
Obtaining Source and Building Packages</h3>

<p>
Obtaining Source code can be done by simply running <code>apt-get source
package</code>, which will also extract the source.
</p>

<p>
Extracting a Debian source package requires the file
<code>package_version.dsc</code> and the files listed in it. You build the
Debian build directory with the command
<code>dpkg-source -x package_version.dsc</code>
</p>

<p>
Building a package is done in the now existing Debian build directory
<code>package-version</code> with the command
<code>dpkg-buildpackage -B "-mMyName &lt;MyEmail&gt;"</code>.
Instead <code>-B</code> you can use
<code>-b</code> if you also want to build the architecture independent
parts of the package. You can add
<code>-uc</code> to avoid signing the package with your pgp key.</p>

<p>
Building may needed additional installed packages. The simplest way it to run
<code>apt-get build-dep package</code> which will install all required packages.
</p>

<h3>
Pick One</h3>
<p>
Which package needs to be worked on?  Well, every package that is not
yet ported, but needs to be ported.  This changes constantly, so
it's preferred to concentrate first on packages with a lot of reverse
dependencies, which can be seen in the package dependency graph
<url "http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/graph-radial.pdf"> updated every day,
or on the most-wanted list
<url "http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/graph-total-top.txt"> (this is
long-term wanted, the short-term wanted is
<url "http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/graph-top.txt">).
It is also usually a good idea to pick from the out of date list
<url "http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/out_of_date.txt">, as these used to be
working, and are now broken probably only for just a couple of reasons.
You can also just pick one of the missing packages at random, or watch out for
autobuilding logs on the debian-hurd-build-logs mailing list, or use the
wanna-build list from
<url "http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/failed_packages.txt"> . Some build issues are easier to fix than the others. Typically, "undefined reference to foo", where foo is something like pthread_create, dlopen, cos, ... (which are obviously available on hurd-i386), which just shows that the configure step of the package forgot to include -lpthread, -ldl, -lm, etc. on the Hurd too. Note however that ALSA MIDI functions are not available.
</p>
<p>
Also, check whether work has already been done on
<url "http://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=410472&amp;group_id=30628&amp;func=browse">,
<url "http://alioth.debian.org/tracker/?atid=411594&amp;group_id=30628&amp;func=browse">,
and the BTS (<url "http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/pkgreport.cgi?users=debian-hurd@lists.debian.org;tag=hurd">), and <url "http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/Hurd">,
and the live state of packages on buildd.debian.org, e.g.
<url "https://buildd.debian.org/util-linux">.
</p>

<h4>
Packages That Won't Be Ported</h4>
<p>
Some of these packages, or parts of them, might be portable later, but
currently they are considered to be unportable at least. They are normally
marked as NotForUs in the buildd database.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>base/makedev</code>, because the Hurd comes with its own version
of this script. The Debian source package only contains a Linux
specific version.</li>
<li>
<code>base/modconf</code> and <code>base/modutils</code>, because
modules are a concept specific to Linux.</li>
<li>
<code>base/netbase</code>, because the remaining stuff that is there
is highly specific to the Linux kernel. The Hurd uses
<code>inetutils</code> instead.</li>
<li>
<code>base/pcmcia-cs</code>, because this package is Linux specific.</li>
<li>
<code>base/setserial</code>, because it is specific to the Linux
kernel. However, with the port of Linux char drivers to GNU Mach, we
might be able to use it.</li>
</ul>

General Porting Issues</a></h3>
<p>
<a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/porting/guidelines.html>A list of
common issues</a> is available on the upstream website. The following common
issues are specific to Debian.</p>
<p>Before attempting to fix something, check whether the kfreebsd* port maybe
has some fix already, which just needs to be extended to hurd-i386.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<code>Broken libc6 dependency</code>
<p>
Some packages use an erroneous dependency on <code>libc6-dev</code>. This
is incorrect because <code>libc6</code> is specific to some architectures
of GNU/Linux. The corresponding package for GNU is <code>libc0.3-dev</code>
but other OSes will have different ones. You can locate the problem in the
<code>debian/control</code> file of the source tree. Typical solutions include
detecting the OS using <code>dpkg-architecture</code> and hardcoding the
soname, or better, use a logical OR. eg: 
<code>libc6-dev | libc6.1-dev | libc0.3-dev | libc0.1-dev | libc-dev</code>.
The <code>libc-dev</code> is a
virtual package that works for any soname but you have to put it only as the
last option.</p></li>
<li>
<code>undefined reference to snd_*, SND_* undeclared</code>
<p>
Some packages use ALSA even on non-Linux architectures. The oss-libsalsa package
provides some emulation over OSS, but it is limited to 1.0.5, and some features
are not provided, such as all sequencer operations.
</p>
<p>
If the package permits it, alsa support should be disabled on the
<code>!linux-any</code> archs (e.g. through a <code>configure</code>
option), and a <code>[linux-any]</code> qualifier added to the
alsa <code>Build-Depends</code>, and the converse added to
<code>Build-Conflicts</code>, such as 
<code>Build-Conflicts: libasound2-dev [!linux-any]</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
