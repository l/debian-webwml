Development</h2>
<p>
Although a lot of things have been achieved already, a lot of small
and medium sized tasks have still to be done, and some big things are
missing, too. If you want to help with any of these problems, let us
know.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="hurd-devel-debian">Development of the distribution</a>
involves creation of boot disks, porting software packages etc.</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/devel">Development of the Hurd</a>
is very important, and the GNU web site has more info about getting the
current development sources from CVS.</li>
</ul>
