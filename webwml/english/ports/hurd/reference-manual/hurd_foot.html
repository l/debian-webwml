<H3><A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="hurd_1.html#DOCF1">(1)</A></H3>
<P>The name <EM>Hurd</EM> stands for "Hird of
Unix-Replacing Daemons."  The name <EM>Hird</EM> stands for "Hurd of
Interfaces Representing Depth."
<H3><A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="hurd_1.html#DOCF2">(2)</A></H3>
<P>Remote Procedure
Call.  If you needed to ask, then you've got your work cut out for you
before you'll be ready for Hurd programming.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="hurd_4.html#DOCF3">(3)</A></H3>
<P>The term <EM>bootstrapping</EM> refers to a Dutch
legend about a boy who was able to fly by pulling himself up by his
bootstraps.  In computers, this term refers to any process where a
simple system activates a more complicated system.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT4" HREF="hurd_4.html#DOCF4">(4)</A></H3>
<P>The GRand Unified Bootloader, available
from <A HREF="http://www.uruk.org/grub/">http://www.uruk.org/grub/</A>.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="hurd_6.html#DOCF5">(5)</A></H3>
<P>Note that this function will be deleted
when the Mach pager interface is fixed to provide this information.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT6" HREF="hurd_6.html#DOCF6">(6)</A></H3>
<P>The
latter portion of <CODE>&#60;hurd/io.defs&#62;</CODE> and all of
<CODE>&#60;hurd/shared.h&#62;</CODE> describe how to implement shared-memory I/O
operations.  However, shared I/O has been deprecated.  See section <A HREF="hurd_6.html#SEC36">Conch Management</A>, for more details.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="hurd_7.html#DOCF7">(7)</A></H3>
<P>The number 1 corresponds to the
<CODE>PF_LOCAL</CODE> C library socket domain constant.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="hurd_9.html#DOCF8">(8)</A></H3>
<P>It is important to note that device drivers are not
provided by the Hurd, but by the underlying microkernel.  Hurd `devices'
are just storeio-translated nodes which make the microkernel device
drivers obey Hurd semantics.  If you wish to implement a new device
driver, you will need to consult the appropriate microkernel
documentation.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="hurd_9.html#DOCF9">(9)</A></H3>
<P>"RAID" stands for <EM>Redundant Array of
Independent Disks</EM>: several disks used in
parallel to achieve increased capacity, redundancy and/or
performance.
<H3><A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="hurd_11.html#DOCF10">(10)</A></H3>
<P>You
are lost in a maze of twisty little filesystems, all alike....
