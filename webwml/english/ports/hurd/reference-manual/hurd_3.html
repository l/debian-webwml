<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC11">Installing</A></H1>

<P>
Before you can use the Hurd on your favorite machine, you'll need to
install all of its software components.  Currently, the Hurd only runs
on Intel i386-compatible architectures (such as the Pentium), using the
GNU Mach microkernel.


<P>
If you have unsupported hardware or a different microkernel, you will
not be able to run the Hurd until all the required software has been
<EM>ported</EM> to your architecture.  Porting is an involved process which
requires considerable programming skills, and is not recommended for the
faint-of-heart.  If you have the talent and desire to do a port, contact
<A HREF="mailto:bug-hurd@gnu.org">bug-hurd@gnu.org</A> in order to coordinate the effort.




<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC12">Binary Distributions</A></H2>

<P>
By far the easiest and best way to install the Hurd is to obtain a GNU
binary distribution.  Even if you plan on recompiling the Hurd itself,
it is best to start off with an already-working GNU system so that you
can avoid having to reboot every time you want to test a program.


<P>
You can get GNU from a friend under the conditions allowed by the GNU
GPL (see section <A HREF="hurd_1.html#SEC6">GNU General Public License</A>).  Please consider sending a donation to the Free
Software Foundation so that we can continue to improve GNU software.


<P>
You can also FTP the complete GNU system from your closest GNU mirror,
or <A HREF="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/</A>.  The GNU binary distribution is
available in a subdirectory called <TT>`gnu-<VAR>n.m</VAR>'</TT>, where <VAR>n.m</VAR>
is the version of the Hurd that this GNU release corresponds to
(0.2 at the time of this writing).  Again, please consider
donating to the Free Software Foundation.


<P>
The format of the binary distribution is prone to change, so this manual
does not describe the details of how to install GNU.  The <TT>`README'</TT>
file distributed with the binary distribution gives you complete
instructions.


<P>
After you follow all the appropriate instructions, you will have a
working GNU/Hurd system.  If you have used Linux-based GNU systems or
other Unix-like systems before, the Hurd will look quite familiar.  You
should play with it for a while, referring to this manual only when you
want to learn more about the Hurd.  Have fun!


<P>
If the Hurd is your first introduction to the GNU operating system, then
you will need to learn more about GNU in order to be able to use it.
You should talk to friends who are familiar with GNU, in order to find
out about classes, online tutorials, or books which can help you learn
more about GNU.


<P>
If you have no friends who are already using GNU, you can find some
useful starting points at the GNU web site, <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">http://www.gnu.org/</A>.
You can also send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:help-hurd@gnu.org">help-hurd@gnu.org</A>, to contact
fellow Hurd users.  You can join this mailing list by sending a request
to <A HREF="mailto:help-hurd-request@gnu.org">help-hurd-request@gnu.org</A>.




<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC13">Cross-Compiling</A></H2>

<P>
Another way to install the Hurd is to use an existing operating system
in order to compile all the required Hurd components from source code.
This is called <EM>cross-compiling</EM>, because it is done between two
different platforms.


<P>
<EM>This process is not recommended unless you are porting the Hurd to
a new platform.</EM>  Cross-compiling the Hurd to a platform which already
has a binary distribution is a tremendous waste of time... it is
frequently necessary to repeat steps over and over again, and you are
not even guaranteed to get a working system.  Please, obtain a GNU
binary distribution (see section <A HREF="hurd_3.html#SEC12">Binary Distributions</A>), and use your time to
do more useful things.  If you are capable of cross-compiling, then you
are definitely skilled enough to make more useful (and creative)
modifications to the GNU system.


<P>
To emphasize this point: downloading the entire GNU system over a 9600
baud modem takes <EM>much less time</EM> than cross-compilation, and
provides better results, too.


<P>
If you are still sure that you would like to cross-compile the Hurd, you
should send e-mail to the <A HREF="mailto:bug-hurd@gnu.org">bug-hurd@gnu.org</A> mailing list in
order to coordinate your efforts.  People on that list will give you
advice on what to look out for, as well as helping you figure out a way
that your cross-compilation can benefit Hurd development.  After that,
don your bug-resistant suit, and read the <TT>`INSTALL-cross'</TT> file,
which comes with the latest Hurd source code distribution.  The
instructions in <TT>`INSTALL-cross'</TT> are usually out-of-date, but they contain
some useful hints buried amongst the errors.
