<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>Contacting the Developers</h2>
<P>
There are currently three mailing lists that are related to the Hurd.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="../../MailingLists/subscribe"><tt>debian-hurd</tt> is a mailing
list hosted by Debian for development of the Debian GNU/Hurd distribution.
If you have problems with the Debian packages of the Hurd, or if you want to
join the development, this is the correct place.</LI>
<LI><tt>help-hurd</tt> is a mailing list hosted by
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> for user questions about the Hurd. If
you have general questions or comments about the Hurd, please address them
to the <tt>help-hurd</tt> list.</LI>
<LI><tt>bug-hurd</tt> is a mailing list hosted by GNU used to discuss the
development of the Hurd. Before writing program code for the Hurd you should
get advice from the developers on this list. You can also report bugs there,
but please consider using the <a href="../../Bugs">Debian Bug Tracking
System</A> for this purpose.</LI>
</UL>
</p>
<p>
There are further mailing lists that are closely related to the Hurd
development.
<ul>
<li><a name="bug-grub"><tt>bug-grub</tt></a> is a mailing list hosted by GNU
for discussion about GNU Grub development.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contacting the Web Author</h2>
<p>
If you have troubles with the web server, you should contact
<tt>webmaster@debian.org</tt>, but if you find any errors in the content of
the Hurd porting pages, you should write
<a href="mailto:brinkmd@debian.org">Marcus Brinkmann</A>, so he can fix it.
