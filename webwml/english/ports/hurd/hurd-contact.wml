Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>
Contacting the Developers</h2>
<p>
There are currently three mailing lists related to the Hurd.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="../../MailingLists/subscribe"><code>debian-hurd</code></a> is
a mailing list hosted by Debian for development of the Debian GNU/Hurd
distribution. If you have problems with the Debian packages of the
Hurd, or if you want to join the development, this is the correct
place.</p>
<p>
As the Debian GNU/Hurd project is covered by <a
href="http://kt.linuxcare.com/KC/debian-hurd/index.html">Kernel
Cousin</a> you can read <em>excellent</em> summaries of the mailing
list discussion online. Don't waste your time reading the full thing,
go over to Kernel Cousin!</p></li>
<li>
<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/mailinglists.html"><code>help-hurd</code></a>
is a mailing list hosted by <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> for
user questions about the Hurd. If you have general questions or
comments about the Hurd, please address them to the
<code>help-hurd</code> list.</li>
<li>
<a
href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/mailinglists.html"><code>bug-hurd</code></a>
is a mailing list hosted by GNU used to discuss the development of the
Hurd. Before writing program code for the Hurd you should get advice
from the developers on this list. You can also report bugs there, but
please consider using the <a href="../../Bugs/">Debian Bug Tracking
System</A> for this purpose.</li></ul></p>
<p>
There are further mailing lists that are closely related to the Hurd
development.
<ul>
<li><a name="bug-grub"><tt>bug-grub</tt></a> is a mailing list hosted
by GNU for discussion about GNU Grub development.</li></ul>
<h2>
Contacting the Web Author</h2>
<p>
If you have troubles with the web server, you should contact
<tt>webmaster@debian.org</tt>, but if you find any errors in the
content of the Hurd porting pages, you should write to <a
href="mailto:brinkmd@debian.org">Marcus Brinkmann</A>, so he can fix
it.</p>
