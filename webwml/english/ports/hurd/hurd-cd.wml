<H1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>

<h2>Using the unofficial Debian GNU/Hurd installation CD-ROMs</H2>


<P>There are two CD images.  Most of the mess that is associated with
a developing os will be found on the second CD leaving the first CD
relatively clean and consistent.  But there are a considerable number
of important packages on the second CD and this will be needed unless
you plan to install these packages over a network.</P>

<H3>Download.</H3>

<P>The current iso images are hurd-E1-main.iso and hurd-E1-extra.iso
and these are some of the sites that have the current images.</P>

<H3>How the Installation Disc works</H3>

<P>The standard Debian GNU/Linux installation CDs uses the cross
install method to install the base system.  A ramdisk is created in
memory and a mini GNU/Linux system installed into this disk.  This
mini system is used to partition and format drives, and to prepare the
target machine for the main installation.  The critical phase is to
unpack a tarball with the essential base packages onto the drives of
the target system.  The new system is then rebooted using the packages
installed onto the HDD.  Further packages are then installed and
configured to create the desired system.</P>

<P>As the Hurd also uses the cross install method, this meant that the
scripts to build the Hurd installation CDs could be adapted from the
Debian GNU/Linux boot and CD scripts.</P>

<P>Installing the Hurd using a cd-rom set has several advantages.

<ul><li>
As the Linux system runs in a ramdisk and the tarball is on the cdrom,
the Hurd can be installed onto a bare machine, or onto a system where
people do not want to use the installed operating system.

<li>
The file system storing the packages on the CDs could be reorganised
to incorporate work-arounds.

<li>
There are no partitioning tools for the Hurd (yet) so the installation
CD can be used to partition HDDs during the installation.

<li>
It is faster, less fiddle and most people are familiar with the process.
</ul>


<H3>Hurd Partitions</H3>

<P>The Hurd does not support partition sizes greater than about 1 Gb.
However, several partitions can be created during the installation
process.  The Hurd also uses extensions to the ext2 file system, the
call is "mke2fs -O sparse_super -o hurd /dev/*".  The installation CDs
use this by default.</P>


<H3>Using the Installation CD</H3>

<H4>Preparation.</H4>

<ol>
<li><P><em>Make a GRUB boot-disk</em>
<p>
The image file is /install/grub-boot-0.5.95.image on the CDROM.  You
can use "dd" if you are working in Linux or rawrite if you are working
in MS.</P>

<li><P>Make certain that you understand Linux, GRUB and Hurd methods
of naming drives and partitions. You will be using all three and the
relationship between them can be confusing.
</ol>

<p> Hurd uses different partition names to Linux, so be careful. IDE
hard disks are numbered in order, beginning from hd0. The second IDE
drive will be hd1, regardless of whether it is a slave or a second
master. SCSI drives are also numbered in absolute order.  They will
always be sd0, sd1, and so on regardless of whether the two drives are
SCSI id 4 and 5 or whatever. Experience has shown that CD-ROM drives
can be tricky.  More about this later.

<p> Linux-style partitions are always called sn when using the Hurd,
where n is the partition number, so the first partition on the first
IDE drive will be hd0s1, the third partition on the second SCSI drive
will be sd1s3, and so on.
				
<p> GRUB has yet another partition naming system. It calls partitions
(hdN,n), but this time the disk number and partition number are both
zero indexed, and the disks run in order, all the IDE disks first, and
the SCSI ones second.  This time, the first partition on the first IDE
drive will be (hd0,0).  To really cause a confusion, (hd1,2) could
refer to the first SCSI drive if you only have one IDE drive, or it
could refer to the second IDE drive.  So it is important that you have
worked out the various names of your partitions before you start.</P>
						      
<H4>Installation</H4>

<ol>
<li><em>Boot the CD.</em>
<p>
Any of the methods of booting a Debian 2.2 (potato) CD will
work, ie. from the CD, from MS and by any of the boot/root floppy images.
A complete set of base floppies can created if there is no cdrom drive.

<li><em>After the opening screens, open "Partition a Hard Disk".</em>
<p>
If you are going to copy the .deb packages onto the HDD then you will need 
to create to other partitions, one for each CD. As there are no 
partitioning tools for the Hurd so you have to use this facility. About 
500 Mb will be enough to start with for them main system.  If you need to 
create another partition then you can reboot the CD and use the tools in 
the Linux ramdisk to do this.
			    
<li><em> Work out the GRUB and Hurd names of the partition you will be using.</em>

<li><em>Prepare your partitions using "Partition a Hard Disk"</em>
and make certain that you have a swap partition.  Hurd is fussy about swap.

<li><em> Format your Hurd partition</em>
using "Initialize a Hurd or Linux Partition" and mount it on <code>/</code>.
Do not mount  any other partitions. (I need to correct this in hurd-F1).</P>

<li><em>Install the base system using "Install the Base System".</em></P>
				    
<li><em>Insert a GRUB floppy in the drive and reboot with "Reboot the System"</em>
(don't forget to reset the bios).  That is it!  [First reboot]</p>
</ol>   

<P>If your Hurd partition is <code>(hd0,0)</code> [GRUB nomenclature]
and <code>sd0s1</code> [Hurd], which being interpreted means the first
partition on the first HDD which is SCSI and there are no IDE drives,
then the system will boot with no intervention.<BR>

If your Hurd partition is <code>(hd0,0)</code> [GRUB nomenclature] and
<code>hd0s1</code> [Hurd], which being interpreted means the first
partition on the first HDD which is IDE, then GRUB will only be
slightly confused.  It will tell you that it cannot find
<code>sd0s1</code> and ask you to correct it.  Having thoroughly
understood the different naming schemes you know instantly that the
correct answer is hd0s1.  GRUB will then ask if it should use
<code>/boot/serverboot.gz</code>, reply with "Enter".<BR>

It does not get much worse.  If your partition is not either of the
above GRUB has both a menu and tab completion, so use them.</P>

<h5>Example</h5>

<P>"Press any key to continue"  Do the obvious and a menu will be presented.
The chances are that what you need will not be there.

<p>
"c"  gets you to a command line.</P>

<P>A step by step process can now be used.
</P>
<P>+++++<BR>
grub$ root "TAB"    [your entry - TAB is the TAB key]<BR>
Possible commands are: root rootnoverify   [GRUB's response]<BR>
+++++<BR>
grub$ root "(TAB"   - - - - "(TAB" is your responce.<BR>
Possible disks are:   fd0 hd0 hd1<BR>
+++++<BR>		  
grub$ root ("hd0,TAB"    (assuming hd0 is where the tarball has been installed)<BR>
Possible partitions are:<BR>
Partition num: 0, Filesystem type is unknown, partition type 0x82<BR>
Partition num: 1, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
Partition num: 2, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
Partition num: 4, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
Partition num: 5, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
Partition num: 6, Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
+++++<BR>
grub$ root (hd0,"4)ENTER"	(assuming the Hurd is on the 5th partition.)
 - - "ENTER" is the enter key.<BR>
Filesystem type is ext2fs, partition type 0x83<BR>
+++++</P>

<P>GRUB now knows where to go and now Hurd has to be told where to go 
in Hurdish.</P>

+++++<BR>
grub$ "kernel /boot/gnumach.gz root=hd0s5 -s  ENTER"       (Using Hurd naming)<BR>
Multiboot-elf,.....<BR>
+++++</P>

<P>gnumach is the kernel and it is on hd0s5 in the /boot directory.
  -s = single user mode.</P>

<P>+++++<BR>
grub$ "module /boot/serverboot.gz  ENTER"<BR>
Mulltiboot-module, ........<BR>
+++++</P>

<P>Serverboot will load the kernel.  Everything is now ready, so we can boot.</P>

<P>++++<BR>
grub$ "boot ENTER"<BR>
+++++</P>

<P>Keep you hands off the keyboard until the boot process has
completed.</P>

<P>"/boot/grub/menu.lst" on the GRUB floppy can be edited so you
system will boot without manual intervention.</P>


<H3>The next steps.</H3>

<ol>
<li><em>After the system has booted run ./native-install.</em> Reboot
the system using "reboot".  THIS IS IMPORTANT watch the boot messages
and note carefully where the cdrom is.  [Second reboot]</P>
    
<li><em>After the reboot has completed run ./native-install a second time.</em> 
This time a whole bundle of packages will be configured.  Reboot yet again. 
[Third reboot]. You will now have a system to configure.<BR> 
Login as root, "login root".</P>

<li><em>cd to /dev.  Make the necessary devices.</em> Ie, for the
cdrom, the swap partition and any other HDD partitions.

<p> Eg
"MAKEDEV hd2 hd0s2 hd0s3"</P>
		
<li><em>Edit /etc/fstab, "ae /etc/fstab"</em>.
ae is not a bad editor for it's size.<p>
Add the HDD partitions, eg,<br>
/dev/[Hurd partition name]   none    swap    sw    0       0<BR>
/dev/[Hurd partition name]   /CD1     ext2    rw    1       1</P>

<P>The Hurd uses the ext2 fs.  "/CD1" is a suggested mount-point for 
the partition which contains the packages from hurd-E1-main. 
Swap can be shared with Linux.</P>
					
<li><em> Activate the swap "swapon -a".</em>
Check to see that is has worked.  Swap is recommended with the Hurd.</P>

<li><em>Set up the translator that accesses the cdrom,</em> eg
<p>
settrans /cdrom /hurd/isofs /dev/[Hurd drive name]</P>
	
<li><em>cd to /cdrom</em>.
Run "./perl-upgrade" which is in the root directory of the cdrom.</P>
		
<li><em>Run "dselect"</em>.
<p>Choose the "Mounted filesystem" for access (the cdrom is jammed,
remember).  "/cdrom/dists/unstable" should find the Debian
installation tree.  There is only the ../main/binary-hurd-i386 tree,
so don't worry if dselect makes rude noises at you because it can't
find contrib. contrib, non-US and non-free are incorporated into this
single file system.</P>
				
<li><em> "Update" next.</em>
<p> Using the "Select" menu, unselect the tetex packages. Run
"install" and think of something else to do. File access is slow. The
installation run should be clean except for a trivial comment at the
end.</P>
