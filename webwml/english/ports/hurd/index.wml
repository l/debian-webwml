<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<P>
The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</A> is a set
of translators on top of the GNU Mach Microkernel. Together they build the
base for the <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</A> Operating System.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Debian is only available for Linux, but with Debian
GNU/Hurd we have started to offer the Hurd as a development platform, too.
Debian GNU/Hurd is not officially released yet, and won't be for some time.
</P>
<H2>Development</H2>
<P>
This is, because the Hurd is under development, and does not provide the
performance and stability you would expect from a production system. Also,
the number of Debian packages ported to the Hurd does only make a small
percentage of the full Debian distribution (about 10%). There is a lot of
work to do before we can make a release.
</P>
<P>
Until then, you can participate in the development if you want. Depending on
your experience and time commitment, you can help us in many different
ways. For example, we need experienced C hackers for development and
implementation of new features, we need C hackers for bug fixing and
debugging, too. If you are not very experienced in C programming, you can
still help: Either by testing the existing systems, and reporting bugs, or
by trying to compile more software you have experience with. Also writing
documentation is important, or maintaining the web pages.
</P>
<H2>How do I join?</H2>
<P>
To start with Hurd development, you should <A HREF="hurd-install">install
the Hurd</A>, and get used to it. Also, join the <A HREF="hurd-contact">mailing
lists</A> and try to get a feeling for the state of the development. Offer
your help, and we will tell you what is needed. There are also various
<A HREF="hurd-task">task lists</A> available.
</P>
