<h1>
Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/">Hurd</a> is a set of
servers running on top of the GNU Mach microkernel. Together they
build the base for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> operating
system.</p>
<p>
Currently, Debian is only available for Linux, but with Debian
GNU/Hurd we have started to offer GNU/Hurd as a development, server
and desktop platform, too. However, Debian GNU/Hurd is not officially
released yet, and won't be for some time.</p>
<h2>
Development</h2>
<p>
The Hurd is under <a href="hurd-devel">active development</a>, but
does not provide the performance and stability you would expect from a
production system. Also, only about every second Debian package has
been ported to the GNU/Hurd.  There is a lot of work to do before we
can make a release.</p>
<p>
Until then, you can participate in the development if you want.
Depending on your experience and time commitment, you can help
us in many different ways. For example, we need experienced C hackers
to develop and implement new features and to fix bugs and debug the system.
The <a href=http://people.debian.org/~sthibault/failed_packages.txt>Failed page</a> shows the list of failing packages and a summary why.
If you are not very experienced in C programming, you can still help:
Either by testing the existing systems and reporting bugs, or by trying
to compile some unported software you have experience with.
Also writing documentation is important, or maintaining the web pages.</p>
<h2>
Porting</h2>
<p>
Porting packages is quite trivial most of the time, there are just a couple of
traps that they can fall into, a <a href="hurd-devel-debian#porting_issues">list
of common issues</a> is available.</p>
<h2>
How do I join?</h2>
<p>
To start with Hurd development, you should <a
href="hurd-install">install Debian GNU/Hurd</a> and get used to
it. Also, join the <a href="hurd-contact">mailing lists</A> and try to
get a feeling for the state of the development. Offer your help, and
we will tell you what is needed to do.
