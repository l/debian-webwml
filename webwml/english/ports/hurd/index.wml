<h1>
Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>
Introduction</h2>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">Hurd</a> is a
set of servers running on top of the GNU Mach microkernel. Together they
build the base for the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a> operating
system.</p>
<p>
Currently, Debian is only available for Linux, but with Debian
GNU/Hurd we have started to offer the Hurd as a development, server
and desktop platform, too. However, Debian GNU/Hurd is not officially
released yet, and won't be for some time.</p>
<h2>
Development</h2>
<p>
The Hurd is under <a href="hurd-devel">active development</a>, but
does not provide the performance and stability you would expect from a
production system. Also, the number of Debian packages ported to the
Hurd does only make a small percentage of the full Debian distribution
(about 10%). There is a lot of work to do before we can make a
release.</p>
<p>
Until then, you can participate in the development if you want.
Depending on your experience and time commitment, you can help
us in many different ways. For example, we need experienced C hackers
to develop and implement new features and to fix bugs and debug the system.
If you are not very experienced in C programming, you can still help:
Either by testing the existing systems and reporting bugs, or by trying
to compile some unported software you have experience with.
Also writing documentation is important, or maintaining the web pages.</p>
<h2>
How do I join?</h2>
<p>
To start with Hurd development, you should <a
href="hurd-install">install the Hurd</a> and get used to it. Also,
join the <a href="hurd-contact">mailing lists</A> and try to get a
feeling for the state of the development. Offer your help, and we will
tell you what is needed to do. There are also various <a
href="hurd-devel-tasks">task lists</a> available.</p>
