<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<p>
Note that this FAQ will not only contain FAQ's, but probably all interesting
talk on the Hurd mailing lists. I am going to use this as a catch all bucket
until the various information is in its proper place.

<h3>"General"</h3>
<p>
<b>Question</b>:
Is the Hurd under development, or is it a dead project?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
It is under active development these days. We are fixing bugs to get more
stability and port many common software packages. We also add small to
medium sized features. We would like to get more developers on board, too.
There are a lot of very interesting features to be implemented, and you
seldom get the chance to design and implement parts of an exciting
operating system!</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Does it run at all?</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b>
Yeah.
</p>

<h3>... At Installation Time</h3>
<P>
<B>Question</B>:
Which partition type should I use for my GNU/Hurd partition?</P>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
You should use an ext2 file system. Alternatively, you may
use BSD style ufs. The partition type number for ext2fs is 0x83 (same as Linux),
<em>not</em> 0x63 (GNU HURD). Thomas explains why 0x63 is the wrong choice:
<blockquote>
One day we may have a new filesystem format, which would probably be
called the GNU Hurd filesystem format, and might well use that
partition code.  Regardless, it is always an error to use that code
for an ext2fs partition, as Roland points out.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What is my partition name/number?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
I knew you would ask this. If I had to reduce this FAQ to only one question,
I'd choose this one. It is pretty easy, but you have to know that there are
actually three naming convention we face here.</p>
<p>
All naming conventions use <code>hd</code> for IDE and <code>sd</code> for
SCSI disks. So far the commonalities. Now for the differences.</p>
<p>
First, figure out the disk number. If it is a SCSI disk, you need to know
the SCSI disk number. If it is an IDE disk, you need to know on which
controller it is and if it is a master or slave. For Linux, the master
disks on the primary controller has the letter "a", the slave
on the same controller the letter "b". Master and slave on the secondary
controller have the letters "c" and "d" respectively. The Hurd does use BSD
style notation and does use "0", "1", "2" and "3" instead "a", "b", "c" and
"d". So it is <code>/dev/hdc</code> under Linux, but <code>/dev/hd2</code>
under the Hurd. Got it? Good. GRUB does it differently! GRUB is doing it
like the BIOS and enumerates all installed disks it can boot from starting
from "0" incrementing by 1. So "hd(0,?)" is a partition on the first disk it
can boot from, regardless if this is a master or slave or whatever. The
second disk it finds has "hd(1,?)" etc. Luckily, the BIOS is searching in the well
defined order primary controller master/slave, secondary controller
master/slave.</p>
<p>
Now figure out the partition number. The partition number for DOS style
partitions is the same under Linux and the Hurd, but the Hurd does use BSD
style notation with slices. So it is <code>/dev/hdc3</code> under Linux, but
<code>/dev/hd2s3</code> under the Hurd. If you use BSD partitions, you
already know what the Hurd name for this partition is. GRUB does it, again,
differently: It starts counting from "0", so <code>/dev/hd0s3</code> is
<code>hd(0,2)</code> in GRUB, <em>not</em> <code>hd(0,3)</code>!</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
How do I add a swap partition?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
A swap partition is also called a paging file. Usually, it is sufficient to
add the swap partition to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> just as you would under Linux.
You can swap to a Linux swap partition, and the Hurd will honour the Linux
swap signature (both versions). But the Hurd will just as happily swap to
any other raw disk space and overwrite anything it finds, so be careful!
</p>
<p>If you want to swap to a file, or make sure that it checks the Linux swap
signature before, you need to edit <tt>/boot/servers.boot</tt>. The syntax
is the partition device file name, plus optionally the swap file inside an
ext2fs, followed by a space and then one of
<tt>$(add-raw-paging-file)</tt>, </tt>$(add-linux-paging-file)</tt>,
<tt>$(add-paging-file)</tt>. The first works with any partition/file and
does not honour any swap sigature or other data. The second has a safety
check and only works if a Linux swap signature can be found. The third looks
for a swap signature first and falls back to raw paging if it couldn't find
one. This is also the default for entries in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
I get <code>Operation not permitted</code> error at installation time!</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
You forgot to set the file system owner of the Hurd partition to
<code>hurd</code>. The Hurd does use additional information in inodes to set
translators, to make this work the partition must be marked as "owned by the
Hurd". You can do this with <code>mke2fs -o hurd /dev/XXX</code> when
creating the partition or afterwards using the <code>e2os</code> script.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What does the following error mean?
<pre>
/hurd/ext2fs.static: cannot vm_map whole disk: (os/kern) no space available
</pre></p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
It means that your partition is bigger than 1 GB. Such big partitions are
currently not supported, sorry.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Why is <code>/usr</code> a symbolic link to <code>.</code>?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
The distinction between <code>/</code> and <code>/usr</code> has historical
reasons, back when Unix systems were booted from two tapes, a small root
tapes an big user tape. Today, we like to use different partitions for these
two spaces. The Hurd throws this historical garbage away, as we think that
we have found a more flexible solution, shadow filesystems. Unfortunately,
shadowfs is not yet implemented.</P>

<p><b>Question</b>:
How do I set up my network card? It was autodetected by GNU Mach.</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
<code>settrans -fgc /servers/socket/2 /hurd/pfinet --interface=eth0
--address=AA.BB.CC.DD --netmask=EE.FF.GG.HH --gateway=II.JJ.KK.LL</code>
where the various <code>WW.XX.YY.ZZ</code> are your IP number, your netmask
and your gateway address respectively. Also don't forget to set up
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code>, <code>/etc/hosts</code> and so on.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Pipes don't work!</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
<code>settrans -fgc /servers/socket/1 /hurd/pflocal</code> will help
you.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What about X?
<p><b>Answer</b>:
Don't ask.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Why?
<p><b>Answer</b>:
The problem is not X, most of X is ported. The complete X distribution
compiles and the programs run. Even the server seem to run just fine.
However, we need to port the Linux character devices to GNU Mach, so we have
a fancy keyboard server and PS/2 mouse support etc. Until then, the servers
are not useful. But you can run the clients with a remote display.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
My X clients won't work!
<p><b>Answer</b>:
Try <code>export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11R6</code>. This is a linker issue.
The Hurd systems wants to use <code>RPATH</code>, and Debian does avoid
<code>RPATH</code>. Sorry, there is no solution for this currently but
setting <code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> to a list of all libraries in unusual
places.</p>

<h3>Using the Hurd</h3>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What's a translator?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
There is a <a href="hurd-doc-translator">text about translators</a> available.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
How can I pass options to serverboot from the GRUB command line?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
Just give them to the kernel and it will pass them down to serverboot.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Can I use the Linux version of <code>e2fsck</code> on my Hurd partition?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
Yes, you can since <code>e2fsprogs-1.05</code>. Check with <code>e2fsck
-V</code> first.</p>

<h3>... When Something Breaks</h3>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What is a <tt>default pager</tt>, <tt>paging</tt>, or a
<tt>pager request</tt>?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
The default pager handles the virtual memory allocation. If it can't
allocate a new memory page, because you are out of memory, some terrible
things may happen. Whenever you get such errors you either need more memory
or you have found a memory leak. Always add a swap partition.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What is a <tt>Gratuitous error</tt>?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
This is coming from <tt>strerror(EGRATUITOUS)</tt>. If you check glibc's
documentation, it will say that this error code has no purpose <tt>:)</tt>.
However, this is not quite true. You only get this when something terrible
happened. Thomas explains:
<blockquote>
More precisely EGRATUITOUS officially means that some server has
responded in an impossible or protocol-violating fashion.  There are
some cases in the Hurd where EGRATUITOUS is returned and probably
something else should be chosen instead.
</blockquote>
If you can reproduce this error message, please report it. But <em>do
not</em> report this for accessing <tt>/dev/fd</tt>, we already know that.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Why does <code>df</code> not work?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
<code>df</code> tries to get a list of all mounted filesystems. This is a
list that is not available under the Hurd because there is currently no
central list of all mounted filesystems. You can try <code>df /</code> to
get the free diskspace on the root filesystem and similar for other
filesystem, but this doesn't work with some versions of
<code>fileutils</code> (for example, as time of writing, summer 1999, it
does not work).</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Where is ...</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
<ul><li><code>fdisk</code>, <code>dmesg</code> are not yet ported.</li>
<li>instead <code>free</code>, use <code>vmstat</code> and <code>vminfo</code>
</ul></p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Is there a <code>/proc</code> filesystem?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
No. Maybe there will be an emulation some day for
programs that need it. If you wonder about the empty <code>/proc</code>
directory, that is a relict from a Debian GNU/Linux package
(<tt>base-files</tt>).</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
<h3>Development</h3>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Where can I get the source?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
You can get the source of all Debian packages on any
<a href="../../distrib/ftplist">Debian ftp mirror</a>. For GNU Mach and the
Hurd, there is also
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/softwrae/devel">anonymous CVS access</a> available.
</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
Where should I start reading the Hurd source code?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
Probably start with the <code>auth</code> server.</p>
