<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<h3>... At Installation Time</h3>
<P>
<B>Question</B>:
Which partition type should I use for my GNU/Hurd partition?</P>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
You should use an ext2 file system. Alternatively, you may
use BSD style ufs. The partition type number for ext2fs is 0x83 (same as Linux),
<em>not</em> 0x63 (GNU HURD). Thomas explains why 0x63 is the wrong choice:
<blockquote>
One day we may have a new filesystem format, which would probably be
called the GNU Hurd filesystem format, and might well use that
partition code.  Regardless, it is always an error to use that code
for an ext2fs partition, as Roland points out.
</blockquote>

<p><b>Question</b>:
How do I add a swap partition?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
A swap partition is also called a paging file. Usually, it is sufficient to
add the swap partition to <tt>/etc/fstab</tt> just as you would under Linux.
You can swap to a Linux swap partition, and the Hurd will honour the Linux
swap signature (both versions). But the Hurd will just as happily swap to
any other raw disk space and overwrite anything it finds, so be careful!
</p>
<p>If you want to swap to a file, or make sure that it checks the Linux swap
signature before, you need to edit <tt>/boot/servers.boot</tt>. The syntax
is the partition device file name, plus optionally the swap file inside an
ext2fs, followed by a space and then one of
<tt>$(add-raw-paging-file)</tt>, </tt>$(add-linux-paging-file)</tt>,
<tt>$(add-paging-file)</tt>. The first works with any partition/file and
does not honour any swap sigature or other data. The second has a safety
check and only works if a Linux swap signature can be found. The third looks
for a swap signature first and falls back to raw paging if it couldn't find
one. This is also the default for entries in <tt>/etc/fstab</tt>.

<h3>... When Something Breaks</h3>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What is a <tt>default pager</tt>, <tt>paging</tt>, or a
<tt>pager request</tt>?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
The default pager handles the virtual memory allocation. If it can't
allocate a new memory page, because you are out of memory, some terrible
things may happen. Whenever you get such errors you either need more memory
or you have found a memory leak. Always add a swap partition.</p>

<p><b>Question</b>:
What is a <tt>Gratuitous error</tt>?</p>
<p><b>Answer</b>:
This is coming from <tt>strerror(EGRATUITOUS)</tt>. If you check glibc's
documentation, it will say that this error code has no purpose <tt>:)</tt>.
However, this is not quite true. You only get this when something terrible
happened. Thomas explains:
<blockquote>
More precisely EGRATUITOUS officially means that some server has
responded in an impossible or protocol-violating fashion.  There are
some cases in the Hurd where EGRATUITOUS is returned and probably
something else should be chosen instead.
</blockquote>
If you can reproduce this error message, please report it. But <em>do
not</em> report this for accessing <tt>/dev/fd</tt>, we already know that.
