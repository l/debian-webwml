<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<H2>Installing Debian GNU/Hurd</H2>
<P>
There is an excellent document available, the <A
HREF="http://pick.sel.cam.ac.uk/~mcv21/hurd.html">Easy Guide</A> by Matthew
Vernon, which you should definitly read. On this page, you will only find
very sparse information, just enough to get you started if you are an
experienced user or developer.
</P>
<P>
There are two ways to install a Debian GNU/Hurd system. The first way makes
it possible to install directly from the Debian packages, but you will need
<TT>dpkg</TT>, the Debian package manager, to do so. This may be difficult
if you use another Linux distribution beside Debian, or if you don't run
Linux at all. Therefore, there is a second method, using a prepared tar
archive file. After installing that, you can update your system to the most
up to date versions of the Debian packages natively. Both methods will be
described in more detail below.
</P>
<H3>Common Preperations</H3>
<P>
To start the installation, make the Hurd partition with <TT>mke2fs -o hurd
/dev/PARTITION</TT>, where <TT>PARTITION</TT> is the partition of the hard
disk you want to dedicate to the Hurd. Note that the partition size should not
exceed about 1 GB currently, due to a known limitation in the Hurd.
</P>
<P>
Then mount your partition somewhere safe. I use <TT>/gnu</TT> as the mount
point, mostly because this is our default for cross compilation. Any other
place is good enough, as well as doing this into a disk image on a file
system. From here, I will assume that you use <TT>/gnu</TT>. Please change the
commands accordingly if you use something else.
</P>

<H3>Two Alternatives</H3>
<H4>Installing with Debian packages</H3>
<P>
To install Debian GNU/Hurd, you need to fetch the Debian software packages
and my installation scripts. First get the following scripts:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="cross-install"><TT>cross-install</TT></A> - Installing a
	bunch of packages from Linux</LI>
<LI><A HREF="native-install"><TT>native-install</TT></A> - Configuring the new
	system</LI>
<LI><A HREF="dpkg-cross"><TT>dpkg-hurd</TT></A> - Use dpkg on the Hurd
	partition from Linux</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
If you don't have Debian, you will also need a version of <TT>dpkg</TT> for your
system.
</P>
<P>
Last but not least, the Debian packages are required. They are located on
any <A HREF="../../distrib/ftplist">Debian FTP mirror</A>, in the directory
<TT>debian/dists/unstable/main/binary-hurd-i386/</TT>. You need a certain
set which is specified at the top of the <TT>dpkg-hurd</TT> script. You can
save the packages in a single directory or spread in subdirectories in the
way they are organized at the FTP site.
</P>
<P>
Now <TT>cd</TT> into the directory you keep your scripts and the Debian
packages in. If you use a single directory, it must contain all files. If
you use the FTP organization for packages, be sure that the scripts are in
the top level directory, so it can find the packages in <TT>base/</TT> etc.
Run <TT>./cross-install /gnu</TT>. Answer the question about the
<TT>/usr</TT> symlink with <TT>y</TT>. Now continue with <A
HREF="#reboot">Rebooting the System</A>.
</P>

<H4>Installing with tar Archive File</H4>
<P>
Sometimes, I upload snapshots of the current base system to some FTP site.
Those files are named <TT>gnu-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz</TT>, where <TT>YYYYMMDD</TT>
is the date of the snapshot. Those files can be used to install the Hurd even
if you have never seen a Debian system. The procedure described here will
not work out of the box for the <TT>gnu-19990104.tar.gz</TT>, so get a later
one if available.
</P>
<P>
To do this, download the tar file of the most recent date. This is the only
file you will need to get a working system (beside GRUB). <TT>cd /gnu</TT> to
get to the root of the Hurd partition. Now extract the tar file with the
command <TT>tar -xpzf /somewhere/gnu-YYYYMMDD.tar.gz</TT> using the correct
path and date.
<P>

<A NAME="reboot"><H3>Rebooting the System</H4></A>
<P>
Now reboot the system and use GRUB to boot the Hurd partition. I won't give
detailed information on GRUB and partition naming schemes here, this is
covered elsewhere. You will find this and other useful information in the <A
HREF="http://pick.sel.cam.ac.uk/~mcv21/hurd.html">Easy Guide</A> by M. C. Vernon.
</P>
<P>
After the reboot, you only need to run <TT>./native-install</TT> to finish
the installation. Have fun!
