<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<H2>Ports To Other Architectures</H2>
<P>
The GNU Mach kernel should be easily portable, because it is based on the
Mach microkernel, which is ported to many architectures already. Another
strategy is to port the Hurd to another microkernel (for example the OSF
Mach kernel).</p>
<p>
You will need the GNU Lib C library, too, which is very portable.</p>
<p>
The Hurd itself does not contain much machine dependant code. The pfinet server
contains the linux network code, and you'd need to put the linux network code of
your architecture . There is some code
specific to the Mach microkernel which had to be adjusted if GNU Mach is not
used. There are likely some changes necessary to support 64 bit
Architectures and so on, but nothing serious.</p>
<h3>Alpha</h3>
The goal is to port GNU Mach/HURD to the <a
href="http://www.debian.org/ports/alpha/">Alpha</a> and support as many
different systems as possible. More information, including the project
status, can be found at <a
href="http://hurd-alpha.sourceforge.net/">hurd-alpha.sourceforge.net</a>.
<h3>PowerPC</h3>
<p>
Anirudh Joshi was working on a port of the Hurd to the
PowerPC. Unfortunately, the web page is no longer active.
He was using OSF Mach. OSF Mach is also used in the MkLinux project,
and we can expect some very interesting communication between those
projects.</p>
