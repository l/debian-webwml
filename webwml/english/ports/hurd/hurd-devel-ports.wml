<h1>Debian GNU/Hurd</h1>
<H2>Ports To Other Architectures</H2>
<P>
The GNU Mach kernel should be easily portable, because it is based on the
Mach microkernel, which is ported to many architectures already. Another
strategy is to port the Hurd to another microkernel (for example the OSF
Mach kernel).</p>
<p>
You will need the GNU Lib C library, too, which is very portable.</p>
<p>
The Hurd itself does not contain machine dependant code. There is some code
specific to the Mach microkernel which had to be adjusted if GNU Mach is not
used. There are likely some changes necessary to support 64 bit
Architectures and so on, but nothing serious.</p>
<h3>PowerPC</h3>
<p>
Anirudh Joshi is working on a
<a href="http://www.glue.umd.edu/~ajoshi/hurdppc.html">port of the Hurd to the
PowerPC</a>. He is using OSF Mach and currently brings the C library into shape,
as well as some parts of the Hurd. Snapshots will be made available
somewhere in the near future. OSF Mach is also used in the MkLinux project,
and we can expect some very interesting communication between those
projects.</p>
