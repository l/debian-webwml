<toc-add-entry name="about">Debian on Motorola 680x0</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Motorola 680x0 series of processors have powered personal
computers and workstations since the mid-1980s.  Debian currently runs
on the 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 processors: this is an unofficial port
meaning that there's not an official and released m68k port any more but 
this port is under development.</p>

<p>Please note that a 
<a href="http://foldoc.org/foldoc.cgi?query=memory+management+unit">
memory management unit (MMU)</a> is
<em>required</em>; this rules out the "EC" variants of these
processors.  Floating-point emulation is available; however, it is not
functional on some mac models due to a bug in some revisions of the 68LC040
processor. (68LC040 processors in other subarchitectures are fine; only
Macintoshes appear to have been shipped with the broken 68LC040
processors).</p>

<toc-add-entry name="status">Status</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Debian m68k port was first officially released with Debian 2.0
(hamm) and was an official port until Debian 4.0 (etch). There's now an effort
to revive this port.</p>

<p>Currently, the Debian/m68k port supports Atari, Amiga, VMEbus, and some
Macintosh systems.</p>

<p>
Thorsten Glaser has created <a 
href="http://people.debian.org/~tg/f/m68k/">a tarball</a> of a freshly made
<tt>/var/cache/pbuilder/base.cow</tt> (which can also be used as a chroot
of Debian unstable on any Linux/m68k machine with a TLS capable kernel, or 
as starting point for that) and he plan to upgrade it quite regularly.
The current VM image is based on a much older unstable but works just fine
as starting point and is documented on <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/Aranym/Quick">the wiki page about Aranym</a>.
</p>

<p>For further information on the current status of the m68k port, please
visit our <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/M68k/Status">wiki page</a>.</p>

<p>Help is always needed and welcome!  In particular, kernels and boot
images supporting other ports of <a href="http://www.linux-m68k.org/">\
the Linux/m68k kernel</a>, like the Q40/Q60 and Sun 3, would be nice.</p>

<p>If you're willing to help, we maintain TODO lists on <a
href='https://wiki.debian.org/'>the Debian wiki</a> for <a
href='https://wiki.debian.org/M68k/Porting'>the Debian/m68k system</a> and
<a href='https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/M68k'>The Debian-installer
port to the m68k architecture</a>.</p>


<p>The <a href="http://unstable.buildd.net/index-m68k.html">Debian/68k autobuild
system</a> contains up to date information about the porting effort.
In case of questions and/or problems related to the autobuild system
please contact <email "debian-68k@lists.debian.org" /> with a subject tag of
"[buildd]".</p>

This is a list of people who are working on the Debian/m68k project.
It also includes some significant contributors who have "moved on" to
other things.  Let us know if you're missing from this list!

<dl>

<dt>Frank Neumann
<dd>
Launched m68k port of Debian.

<dt>Martin "Joey" Schulze
<dd>
Provided infrastructure at Infodrom for "kullervo", the primary build
daemon, to be connected to the Internet.  Also helped organize Linux
hacker meetings at Oldenburg.

<dt>Roman Hodek
<dd>
With James Troup, created <tt>buildd</tt>, the automated build daemon
for the m68k port.  buildd is now used by other architectures, too.

<dt>James Troup
<dd>
Wrote <tt>quinn-diff</tt> and other utilities to automate package building.

<dt>David Huggins-Daines
<dd>
Maintained m68k support on the boot-floppies team.  Also supports the <a
href="http://www.mac.linux-m68k.org/">upstream Mac kernel</a>.

<dt>Michael Schmitz
<dd>
Built and tested the installation system for 2.1.

<dt>Christian T. Steigies
<dd>
Maintains Debian/68k kernel packages.

<dt>Stephen R. Marenka
<dd>
Together with Wouter Verhelst, ported debian-installer (the installation
system for Debian 3.1 and above) to the m68k architecture.

<dt>Wouter Verhelst
<dd>
Together with Stephen Marenka, ported debian-installer (the installation system
for Debian 3.1 and above) to the m68k architecture.

<dt>Thorsten Glaser
<dd>
Collected patches from Debian/m68k maintainers, Linux m68k developers, and
other people; brought Debian/m68k through the transition from linuxthreads to
NPTL with TLS by integrating those into the Debian packages and being the
human equivalent of a buildd for long enough to bootstrap Sid again.
Finn Thain, Andreas Schwab and Geert Uytterhoeven provided valuable input to
this, besides those already mentioned above.
