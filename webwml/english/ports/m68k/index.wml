<h1>Debian on Motorola 680x0</h1>

<p>The Motorola 680x0 series of processors have powered personal
computers and workstations since the mid-1980s.  Debian currently runs
on the 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 processors.

<p>Please note that a 
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=memory+management+unit">
memory management unit (MMU)</a> is
<em>required</em>; this rules out the "EC" variants of these
processors.  Floating-point emulation is available with third-party
kernels; however, it is probably not 100% stable yet.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<P>Debian 2.1 (slink) was released with full support for Atari,
Amiga, and VMEbus platforms, and incomplete support for Macintoshes.
Debian 2.2 (potato) includes improved support for these platforms, and is
based on GNU LibC release 2.1.
Later Debian releases also include the m68k port.</p>

<p>Help is always needed and welcome!  In particular, kernels and boot
images supporting other ports of <a href="http://www.linux-m68k.org/">\
the Linux/m68k kernel</a>, like the Q40/Q60 and Sun 3, would be nice.
