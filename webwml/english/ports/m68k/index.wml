<h1>Debian on Motorola 680x0</h1>

<p>The Motorola 680x0 series of processors have powered personal
computers and workstations since the mid-1980s.  Debian currently runs
on the 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 processors.

<p>Please note that a 
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=memory+management+unit">
memory management unit (MMU)</a> is
<em>required</em>; this rules out the "EC" variants of these
processors.  Floating-point emulation is available; however, it is not
functional on some mac models due to a bug in some revisions of the 68LC040
processor. (68LC040 processors in other subarchitectures are fine; only
Macintoshes appear to have been shipped with the broken 68LC040
processors).</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The Debian m68k port was first officially released with Debian 2.0
(hamm).</p>

<p>Current Debian releases support Atari, Amiga, VMEbus, and some Macintosh
systems.</p>

<p>Help is always needed and welcome!  In particular, kernels and boot
images supporting other ports of <a href="http://www.linux-m68k.org/">\
the Linux/m68k kernel</a>, like the Q40/Q60 and Sun 3, would be nice.</p>

<p>If you're willing to help, we maintain TODO lists on <a
href='http://wiki.debian.org/'>the Debian wiki</a> for <a
href='http://wiki.debian.org/M68k/Porting'>the Debian/m68k system</a> and
<a href='http://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/M68kTodo'>The Debian-installer
port to the m68k architecture</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://crest.debian.org/">Debian/68k autobuild
system</a> contains up to date information about the porting effort.
In case of questions and/or problems related to the autobuild system
please contact <email "debian-68k@lists.debian.org" /> with a subject tag of
"[buildd]".</p>
