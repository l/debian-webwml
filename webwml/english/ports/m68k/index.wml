<h1>Debian on Motorola 680x0</h1>

<p>The Motorola 680x0 series of processors have powered personal
computers and workstations since the mid-1980s.  Debian currently runs
on the 68020, 68030, 68040 and 68060 processors.

<p>Please note that a 
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=memory+management+unit">
memory management unit (MMU)</a> is
<em>required</em>; this rules out the "EC" variants of these
processors.  Floating-point emulation is available with third-party
kernels; however, it is probably not 100% stable yet.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The Debian m68k port was first officially released with Debian 2.1
(slink).</p>

<p>Current Debian releases support Atari, Amiga, VMEbus, and some Macintosh
systems.</p>

<p>Help is always needed and welcome!  In particular, kernels and boot
images supporting other ports of <a href="http://www.linux-m68k.org/">\
the Linux/m68k kernel</a>, like the Q40/Q60 and Sun 3, would be nice.

<p>The <a href="http://crest.debian.org/">Debian/68k autobuild
system</a> contains up to date information about the porting effort.</p>
