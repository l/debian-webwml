<h1>Debian SPARC Porting Documentation</h1>

<h2>Porting Debian Packages to SPARC</h2>
  <p>
If you want to be an official porter, you must be a registered Debian
developer.  That is, your private key must appear in the official
keyring.
  <p>
The Debian SPARC porting effort is now organized around the excellent
<code>wanna-build</code> system, first used for the <a
href="../m68k/">m68k</a> port.  With <code>wanna-build</code> in
place, porting boils down to locating the packages where automatic
compilation failed, and then going though and determining what went
wrong.
  <p>
Failed build logs can be found at <a
href="http://marcus.debian.net/~buildd/">http://marcus.debian.net/~buildd/</a>.
Also, you can email <code>wanna-build</code> and ask it for the failed
build logs (see the file <code>README.mail</code> from the
<code>wanna-build</code> distribution).
  <p>
<code>quinn-diff</code> output, which includes a report of packages by
distribution which are out of sync in for the SPARC port can be found
at <a
href="http://buildd.debian.org/quinn-diff/output/unstable/by_priority_split-sparc.txt">
http://buildd.debian.org/quinn-diff/output/unstable/by_priority_split-sparc.txt</a>.
  <p>
Serious porters should learn how to interact with
<code>wanna-build</code> via email.  You'll need to ask <a
href="mailto:bcollins@debian.org">Ben Collins
&lt;bcollins@debian.org&gt;</a> to add your public key to the known
list of keys.
  <p>
<a href="mailto:wdeng@KachinaTech.COM">Ward Deng
&lt;wdeng@KachinaTech.COM&gt;</a> has kindly offered the use of
<code>x0[123].kachinatech.com</code> for use by Debian SPARC porters.
Just send him email requesting an account (you must be an official
developer).


<h2>I'm not an official developer; can I still help?</h2>
  <p>
Certainly.  In fact, most of the real work in a Debian port requires
not official status, just knowledge.  There are a number of things you
can do:
<ul>
      <li>
Track down bugs, and report them to the <a href="../../Bugs/">Debian
Bug Tracking System</a>.
      <li>
Figure out patches for known bugs.  Be sure to submit the patch to the
Bug Tracking System!
      <li>
Help with documentation.  Most documentation areas are managed under
CVS, and most documentation authors can give out CVS access to
non-porters who are interested in helping.
    </ul>
  <p>
So, go ahead and email <a
href="mailto:debian-sparc@lists.debian.org">&lt;debian-sparc@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>
with a description of how you'd like to help; we're sure someone there
can get you started.
