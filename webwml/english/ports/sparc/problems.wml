<h1>Debian SPARC Errata</h1>
  <p>
This page contains a list of well-known problems with Debian SPARC.
Stress is placed on the stable release (or freeze, if appropriate),
since these problems turn over much less frequently, and effect a
greater number of people.
  <p>
The following list of problems do not attempt to replace the Debian
bug-tracking system (BTS).  The main purpose of this information is to
reduce user confusion, reduce traffic on the mailing list, and to
explain workarounds until the bug is fixed.  If there is a bug number
associated with a problem, that bug number will be noted.


<h2>Installation</h2>
  <p>
Due to a bug in how the boot-floppies were made, no Sun4u box can boot
from the rescue floppy.  You'll have to use a different installation
method.
  <p>
There is another bug in the symbolic link from /dev/sunmouse to
/dev/mouse is not created.  As root, just do <tt>ln -s sunmouse
/dev/mouse</tt>.  (Bug fixed in <tt>proposed-updates/makedev</tt>.)
  <p>
If you have an older Sony CDU CD-ROM, and when booting you see the
message, "esp0: disconnect, resetting bus", then you have two
workarounds.  You can boot from silo's "boot:" prompt with your normal
image, plus the argument "max_scsi_luns=1".  Alternatively, you can
upgrade your kernel to 2.2.4 or greater.
  <p>
There are some known problems during installation with PS/2 keyboard
support and some minor problems and noise when installing via serial
console. This is expected to be fixed with the 2.2.11 or greater
boot-floppies update.
  <p>
The 2.2.1 kernel provided by the SPARC boot-floppies does not include
NFSROOT support, due to an oversight.
  <p>
Many of these problems are fixed with the unofficial boot-floppies
test build at <a
href="ftp://lix.polytechnique.fr/pub/Linux/debian/sparc/exp/disks-sparc/current/">
ftp://lix.polytechnique.fr/pub/Linux/debian/sparc/exp/disks-sparc/current/</a>.


<!-- 
The Boot Disks do not appear to work on all PROMS.  On my SS2, SILO
will load, but the kernel will not.  Others have reported the same
problems.

<h2>Broken tftpboot.img</h2>
<p>
 The tftpboot.img we distribute does not seem to work on all
 machines.  On an SS2 with PROM version 2.4, it will hang for a very
 long time in the final ACK, and not ever finish.  This appears to be
 an alignment problem - if the image is padded to a multiple of 4
 bytes, it will run fine.  On PROM 2.6, it works fine.
</p>

<h2>X Window System</h2>
  <p>
Problems relating to the X Window System.

<h3>How do I know which X server to run?</h3>
  <p>
This depends on your machine and which framebuffer (video card) you
have installed.  The following list of X server packages -- pick the
one which matches your hardware and install the package (and set it
the default X server when asked during installation).
<dl>
      <dt>xserver-xsun</dt>
      <dd>
Used for most Sun and clone 8-bit framebuffers, such as CG3, CG6, etc.  Also
includes monochrome support.
      <dt>xserver-xsun-mono</dt>
      <dd>
Used for BWTWO and other monochrome framebuffers, or operating color
framebuffers in monochrome mode.
      <dt>xserver-xsun24</dt>
      <dd>
X server supporting 24-bit color -- suitable for 24-bit framebuffers
supported by the Linux kernel.  Not too many folks can use this.
      <dt>xserver-mach64</dt>
      <dd>
Use this X server for ATI Rage framebuffers, such as found in many
PCI-based UltraSPARC machines.
    </dl>

  <p>
There are experimental Creator accelerated X servers somewhere to be
found.  This should be added to unstable (potato) soon.


<h3>Cannot Start X Except As Root</h3>
  <p>
Filed as <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/35613">Bug#35613</a>.  This
is already fixed in ``unstable'' (as of version xfree86-1 3.3.3.1-3).
We are hoping to update stable to fix this problem as well.
  <p>
The workaround for boxes running ``stable'' is to do something rather
insecure.  As root, do:
<pre>
  chmod 666 /dev/fb?
</pre>

<h3>Issues with Mach64 Server</h3>
  <p>
This server will only look for the framebuffer on <tt>/dev/fd0</tt>.
You may have to fool around with symlinks in there to fake it.
