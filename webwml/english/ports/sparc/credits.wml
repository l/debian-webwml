<h1>Debian SPARC Credits</h1>
  <p>
A selected list of people that we'd like to thank for helping with the
SPARC porting effort are:
<ul>
      <li>
Johnie `netgod' Ingram who ran SPARC auto-compiles, getting the huge
majority of packages ported with no hassles (no hassles to the rest of
us, anyway ;-)
      <li>
Adam Haberlach who produced a Debian SPARC page before I did, from
which I have filched some information.  Adam's email address and web
site have bitten the dust -- if you're out there, Adam, contact me!
      <li>
Eric Delaunay, the fearless master of the boot floppies
      <li>
Steve Dunham, general hacker on the bleeding edge
      <li>
Anders Hammarquist, master of X on SPARC <em>and</em> alpha
      <li>
Christian Meder, who kicks us all into line on the mailing list, and
uploads packages by the dozen!
      <li>
Steve McIntyre, for masterminding the CD efforts
      <li>
Ben Collins, who is porting a lot of packages and working on the
autobuilder
      <li>
Ward Deng, from Kachina Technologies, who has provided assistance and
hardware for porting
      <li>
Jules Bean who originally set up these web pages.
    </ul>
