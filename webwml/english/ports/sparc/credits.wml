<h1>Debian SPARC Credits</h1>
  <p>
A selected list of people that we'd like to thank for helping with the
SPARC porting effort are:
<ul>
      <li>
Johnie `netgod' Ingram who ran SPARC auto-compiles, getting the huge
majority of packages ported with no hassles (no hassles to the rest of
us, anyway ;-)
      <li>
Adam Haberlach who produced a Debian SPARC page before I did, from
which I have filched some information.  Adam's email address and web
site have bitten the dust -- if you're out there, Adam, contact me!
      <li>
Eric Delaunay, the fearless master of the boot floppies
      <li>
Steve Dunham, general hacker on the bleeding edge
      <li>
Anders Hammarquist, master of X on SPARC <em>and</em> alpha
      <li>
Christian Meder, who kicks us all into line on the mailing list, and
uploads packages by the dozen!
      <li>
Steve McIntyre, for masterminding the CD efforts
      <li>
Ben Collins, who is porting a lot of packages and working on the
autobuilder
      <li>
Ward Deng, from Kachina Technologies, who has provided assistance and
hardware for porting
      <li>
<a href="mailto:jules@debian.org">Jules Bean</a> who periodically
remembers to look after this page, and should be hassled relentlessly
with mistakes and suggestions (more general website comments should go
to the address at the bottom of the page).
    </ul>
