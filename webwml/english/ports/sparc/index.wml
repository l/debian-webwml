<h2><a name="intro">Overview</a></h2>
  <p>
These pages are meant to assist users and Debian developers running
Debian/GNU Linux on the SPARC architecture.  In these pages, you will
find information about the current status, currently known problems,
information for and about Debian porters, and pointers to more
information.

<h2><a name="status">Current Status</a></h2>
  <p>
Debian SPARC is officially released and known to be stable.  Supported
are Sun4c, Sun4m, and Sun4u machines (with a 32-bit userland).  See
the <a href="../../releases/slink/sparc/install">Install Manual</a>
for information on supported systems, hardware, and how to install
Debian.
  <p>
In the released, stable ``slink'' distribution, we had to use a
specially patched version of the 2.0.x kernel, and a pre-release of
GNU libc 2.1.  In the upcoming ``potato'' distribution, still
unstable, we have moved to Linux 2.2 (which already has SPARC
patches), the release GNU libc 2.1, egcs 1.1.2, etc.  In short, recent
work in the GNU tool chain is enabling us to keep all of the Debian
ports in sync.


<h3>About 64-bit SPARC support</h3>
  <p>
The Debian SPARC port and the <a href="../sparc64/">UltraSPARC
port</a> (a.k.a. sparc64) have some overlap.  The Debian SPARC port,
as mentioned above, does support the Sun4u (``Ultra'') architecture.
It uses a 64-bit kernel (compiled with a special version of the
<code>egcs</code> compiler, called ``egcs64''), but most of the
applications run in 32-bit.  This is also called a ``32-bit
userland''.  The <a href="../sparc64/">UltraSPARC port</a> is
concerned establishing with a pure 64-bit environment.


<h2><a name="errata">Errata</a></h2>
  <p>
There are a number of known problems with the <a
href="../../releases/slink/">Slink</a> release.  We try to keep track
of these problems, and fixes or workarounds, in our <a
href="problems">Errata page</a>.


<h2><a name="who">Who are we?  How can I help?</a></h2>
  <p>
The Debian SPARC port is a distributed effort, just as Debian is.
Countless people have helped with the porting and documentation
efforts, although a short list of <a href="credits">credits</a> are
available.
  <p>
If you'd like to help, please join in the
&lt;debian-sparc@lists.debian.org&gt; mailing list as <a
href="#link">described below</a>, and chime in.
  <p>
Registered developers who would like to actively port and upload
ported packages should read the porter guidelines in the Developers
Reference, and see the <a href="porting">SPARC porting page</a>.
  <p>


<h2><a name="links">Where can I find out more information?</a></h2>
  <p>
The best place to ask Debian-specific questions about the SPARC port
is on the mailing list, &lt;debian-sparc@lists.debian.org&gt;.
Mailing list <a
href="../../Lists-Archives/index#debian-sparc">archives</a> are
browsable on the web.
  <p>
To subscribe to the list, send a mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org">
debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org</a>, with the word `subscribe'
in the subject line, and no body.  Alternatively, subscribe on the web
with the <a href="../../MailingLists/subscribe">Mailing List
subscription</a> page.
  <p>
Kernel questions should be addressed to the list
&lt;sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu&gt;.  Subscribe by sending a message
with body `subscribe sparclinux' to the address <a
href="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</a>.
There is also a RedHat list, of course.

it covers mostly plain SPARC rather than UltraSPARC.
