<h1>Debian-SPARC</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
 The debian-sparc port is in an 'almost stable' state.  We have a good,
 running system up (these pages were edited using X-windows on a
 SPARCstation 2 with Debian installed).  We are currently working on
 squeezing out a few architecture-specific problems, and we hope to
 have a stable release for debian 2.1 (codename slink).
</p>

<h2>debian-sparc Status</h2>

<h3>Kernel Versions</h3>
<p>
 Sparc support, alas, is not yet fully folded into the 2.0.x kernel
 source distribution.  2.0.33 and 2.0.35 kernels are both known to
 work well for debian-sparc, as do recent 2.1 and 2.2 kernels, with
 special patches.
</p>

<h3>LibC</h3>
<p>
 We use a pre-release of glibc-2.1.  This alone is responsible for
 most of our problems building packages which compile fine on i386.
 Most of the problems here are sorted out now.
</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>
 We have a working X server for 1-bit, 8-bit and 24-bit graphics
 cards.  We use a version of Xsun which has been hacked into XFree86
 (which makes the name 'xfree86' a little meaningless... ;-).
</p>

<h3>Compiling and building</h3>

<p>
 The build/compile environment on the sparc is tantalisingly nearly
 perfect.  There are still a few thorns, however - mostly resulting from the
 glibc version.

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
 No one is 'in charge of' debian-sparc, and there is no concrete
 development team.  The best place to ask debian-specific questions
 about the sparc port is on the mailing list,
 debian-sparc@lists.debian.org.  To subscribe, send a mail to <a
 href="mailto:debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org">
 debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org</a>, with the word 'subscribe'
 in the body.
</p>
<p>
 Some people that I'd like to thank, however, are:
 <ul>
  <li>Johnie 'netgod' Ingram who ran
  sparc auto-compiles, getting the huge majority of packages ported
  with no hassles (no hassles to the rest of us, anyway ;-)
  <li>Adam Haberlach who produced a
  debian-sparc page before I did, from which I have filched some
  information.  Adam's email address and web site have bitten the dust -
  if you're out there, Adam, contact me!
  <li>Eric Delaunay, the fearless master of the boot floppies
  <li>Steve Dunham, general hacker on the bleeding edge
  <li>Anders Hammarquist, master of X on sparc _and_ alpha
  <li>Christian Meder, who kicks us all into line on the mailing list, and
uploads packages by the dozen!
  <li><a href="mailto:jules@debian.org">Jules Bean</a> who periodically
remembers to look after this page, and should be hassled relentlessly with
mistakes and suggestions (more general website comments should go to the
address at the bottom of the page).
 </ul>
</p>
<h2>Where can I find out more information?</h2>
<p>
 The debian-sparc list, mentioned above, is the place to go for all
 debian-sparc-specific questions.  Kernel questions should be
 addressed to the list sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu, subscribe by
 sending a message with body "subscribe sparclinux" to the address <a
 href="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</a>.
 There is also a redhat list, of course.

 There are a few S/Linux websites worth of a visit:
