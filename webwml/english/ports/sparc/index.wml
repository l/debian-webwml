<h1>Debian-SPARC</h1>

<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>
 These pages are not yet an official part of the debian website.  They
 have been created by <a href="mailto:jules@debian.org">Jules Bean</a>
 and all comments should be sent to him.  They are currently under
 construction.  Submissions are gratefully received, as are design
 suggestions.  Bear in mind that the design of this page aims to be
 usable for the forthcoming complete family of debian ports pages.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
 The debian-sparc port is in an 'almost stable' state.  We have a good,
 running system up (these pages were edited using X-windows on a
 SPARCstation 2 with Debian installed).  We are currently working on
 squeezing out a few architecture-specific problems, and we hope to
 have a stable release for debian 2.1 (codename slink).
</p>

<h2>debian-sparc Status</h2>

<h3>Kernel Versions</h3>
<p>
 Sparc support, alas, is not yet fully folded into the 2.0.x kernel
 source distribution.  2.0.33 and 2.0.35 kernels are both known to
 work well for debian-sparc, and are downloadable as binaries from FTP
 at <a
 href="ftp://vger.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/Sparc/">vger.rutgers.edu</a>.
 Unstable support seems to be currently broken - since about 2.1.93.
 However, this is a debian-specific problem, and is probably our bash
 (since the kernel boots fine, but rc scripts segfault).  More details
 on the 'Problems' page.
</p>

<h3>LibC</h3>
<p>
 We use a pre-release of glibc-2.1.  This alone is responsible for
 most of our problems building packages which compile fine on i386.
 There is also a very curious problem that some Sun4c users (myself
 included) see that 'ldd' doesn't work.  This apparently is
 related to some kernel MM stuff, and is sorted in the current
 unstable kernel tree.
</p>

<h3>X</h3>

<p>
 We have a working X server for 1-bit, 8-bit and 24-bit graphics
 cards.  We use a version of Xsun which has been hacked into XFree86
 (which makes the name 'xfree86' a little meaningless... ;-).
</p>

<h3>Compiling and building</h3>

<p>
 The build/compile environment on the sparc is tantalisingly nearly
 perfect.  The following are a list of some of the problems I have
 seen:

 <ul>
  <li> Our C++ environment does not seem to function exactly the same
  as the i386 one.  The package 'menu' appeared to have a few
  'implicit' casts which had to be made explicit or replace to compile
  under my system.  I haven't bothered to chase this one to find out
  exactly what's going on...
  <li> 'ldd' doesn't work on a few machines.  Like mine :-(.  This
  means the the ${shlibs:Depends} phase of debian-package building
  fails.  A possibly workaround is to replace ldd which a wrapper
  which echoes 'statically linked'. (See the 'problems' section).
  <li> &lt;sys/socket.h&gt; won't preprocess, since it uses the files
  netatalk/at.h and linux/rose.h.  Workarounds are either to comment
  out the offending lines from &lt;bits/sockunion.h&gt; (which is what I
  have done on my development machine) or to copy those two header
  files from an i386 box.
 </ul>
</p>

<h3>Problems List</h3>

 <a href="problems.html">A hopefully current list of known
 debian-sparc issues, and workarounds</a>
</p>

<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
 No one is 'in charge of' debian-sparc, and there is no concrete
 development team.  The best place to ask debian-specific questions
 about the sparc port is on the mailing list,
 debian-sparc@lists.debian.org.  To subscribe, send a mail to <a
 href="mailto:debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org">this address</a>, with
 the word 'subscribe' in the body.
</p>
<p>
 Some people that I'd like to thank, however, are:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="mailto:johnie@debian.org">Johnie 'netgod' Ingram</a> who runs
  sparc auto-compiles, getting the huge majority of packages ported
  with no hassles (no hassles to the rest of us, anyway ;-)
  <li><a href="mailto:iko@iko.pp.se">Anders Hammarquist</a> who
  compiled the xserver for sun machines.
  <li><a href="mailto:adam@rocheworld.dyn.ml.org">Adam Haberlach</a> who produced a
  debian-sparc page before I did, from which I have filched some
  information.
  <li>FIXME: Must be lots more people...
 </ul>
</p>

<h3>Unofficial arch-maintainer list</h3>

<p>
 Debian has no official support for the concept of an
 'arch-maintainer'.  However, I maintain this list as a courtesy to
 debian-sparc users.  If you have a problem with one of the following
 packages, and you suspect it may be sparc-related, it's worth
 emailing the maintainer listed here and asking them if they know
 more, before filing a bug report.
</p>
<p>
 If you find yourself needing a particular package, and you compile it
 for your own use, you are encouraged to email <a
 href="jules@debian.org">me</a> and I'll add you to the below list -
 especially if your recompile was not trivial, or you know that the
 package is only partially working.
</p>

<h2>Where can I find out more information?</h2>
<p>
 The debian-sparc list, mentioned above, is the place to go for all
 debian-sparc-specific questions.  Kernel questions should be
 addressed to the list sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu, subscribe by
 sending a message with body "subscribe sparclinux" to the address <a
 href="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</a>.
 There is also a redhat list, of course.
</p>
<p>
 There are a few S/Linux websites worth of a visit:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.clark.net/pub/mike911/linux/sparc/news.html">
      Linux/SPARC news</a> a very up-to-date page by 
      <a href="mailto:mike911@clark.net">Justin Maurer</a>
  <li><a href="http://rocheworld.dyn.ml.org/debian-sparc">Debian/Sparc
      information</a> a page recently put up by <a
      href="mailto:adam@rocheworld.dyn.ml.org">Adam Haberlach</a>,
      including a small FAQ.
  <li><a href="http://www.geog.ubc.ca/s_linux.html">S/Linux Home
      Page</a> - the definitive source for the kernel port.
  <li><a href="http://sunsite.mff.cuni.cz/linux/ultrapenguin-1.0/">The
      UltraPenguin home page</a> UltraPenguin is a port of S/Linux to
      the sun4u ('Ultra') series of machines.
 </ul>
</p>
<p>
 Adam Haberlach started a FAQ.  That will probably eventually be
 integrated into this page.
