<h2 id="intro">Overview</h2>
  <p>
These pages are meant to assist users and Debian developers running
Debian GNU/Linux on the SPARC architecture.  In these pages, you will
find information about the current status, currently known problems,
information for and about Debian porters, and pointers to more
information.

<h2 id="status">Current Status</h2>
  <p>
Debian SPARC is officially released and known to be stable.  Supported
is Sun4u machines (with a 32-bit userland).  See
the <a href="../../releases/stable/sparc/">Install Manual</a>
for information on supported systems, hardware, and how to install
Debian.


<h2 id="sparc64bit">About 64-bit SPARC support</h2>
  <p>
The Debian SPARC port,
as mentioned above, does support the sun4u (&ldquo;Ultra&rdquo;) architecture.
It uses a 64-bit kernel (compiled with gcc 3.3 or newer), but most of the
applications run in 32-bit.  This is also called a &ldquo;32-bit
userland&rdquo;.
  <p>
The Debian SPARC 64 (a.k.a., &ldquo;UltraLinux&rdquo;) porting effort is not
currently conceived as a full porting effort like other ports.
Rather, it is intended to be an <em>add-on</em> to the SPARC Port.
  <p>
In fact, there is really no point in having all applications running
in 64-bit mode.  Full 64-bit mode involves a significant overhead
(memory and disk size) with often no benefit.  Some applications
really can benefit from being in 64-bit mode, and that is the purpose
of this porting effort.

<h3 id="kernelsun4u">Compiling kernels for sun4u</h3>
  <p>
To compile a Linux kernel for Sun4u, you'll need to use the Linux 2.2
or newer source tree.
  <p>
We highly suggest you also use the <tt>kernel-package</tt> package to
help with the installation and management of kernels.  You can compile
a configured kernel in one command (as root):
<pre>
  make-kpkg --subarch=sun4u --arch_in_name --revision=custom.1 kernel_image
</pre>


<h2 id="errata">Errata</h2>
  <p>
Some of the common problems with fixes or workarounds can be found on our
<a href="problems">Errata page</a>.


<h2 id="who">Who are we?  How can I help?</h2>
  <p>
The Debian SPARC port is a distributed effort, just as Debian is.
Countless people have helped with the porting and documentation
efforts, although a short list of <a href="credits">credits</a> are
available.
  <p>
If you'd like to help, please 
join in the &lt;debian-sparc@lists.debian.org&gt; mailing list as
<a href="#links">described below</a>, and chime in.
  <p>
Registered developers who would like to actively port and upload
ported packages should read the porter guidelines in the <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/">Developers
Reference</a>, and see the <a href="porting">SPARC porting page</a>.


<h2 id="links">Where can I find out more information?</h2>
  <p>
The best place to ask Debian-specific questions about the SPARC port
is on the mailing list, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc/">\
&lt;debian-sparc@lists.debian.org&gt;</a>.
Mailing list <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc/">archives</a> are
browsable on the web.
  <p>
To subscribe to the list, send a mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org">\
debian-sparc-request@lists.debian.org</a>, with the word `subscribe'
in the subject line, and no body.  Alternatively, subscribe on the web
with the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-sparc/">Mailing List
subscription</a> page.
  <p>
Kernel questions should be addressed to the list
&lt;sparclinux@vger.rutgers.edu&gt;.  Subscribe by sending a message
with body `subscribe sparclinux' to the address <a
href="mailto:majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu">majordomo@vger.rutgers.edu</a>.
There is also a Red Hat list, of course.
  <p>
This is a very small list of Linux SPARC (a.k.a. &ldquo;S/Linux&rdquo;) links:
 <ul>
      <li>
<a href="http://www.ultralinux.org/">UltraLinux</a> -- the
definitive source for the kernel port.  Don't be deceived by the name;
it covers mostly plain SPARC rather than UltraSPARC.
 </ul>
