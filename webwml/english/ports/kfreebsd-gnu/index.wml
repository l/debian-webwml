<h1>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</h1>

<p>Debian GNU/kFreeBSD is a port that consists of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU userland</a> using the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">GNU C library</a> on top of
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>'s kernel, coupled with the
regular <a href="http://packages.debian.org/">Debian package set</a>.</p>

<p>The GNU C library was ported to FreeBSD's kernel by Bruno Haible.</p>

<p>There's more information about the port in the
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Debian_GNU/kFreeBSD">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD</a>
wiki page.
</p>

<h2>Get started</h2>

<p>The base system is fully functional.  For installing Debian GNU/kFreeBSD
and other useful information, refer to the
<a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/doc">install notes</a>.</p>

<p>There are several <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianPorts/Mirrors">mirrors</a>
that carry the <b>unreleased</b> suite which might still be needed for some
packages, for <b>unstable</b> and <b>testing</b> the normal Debian mirrors
should be used instead.</p>

<h2>How to help</h2>

<p>There's still a large amount of packages that need fixing. Luckily, because
we use Glibc the portability problems are very simple and most times it's
just a matter of copying a test case for "k*bsd*-gnu" from another Glibc-based
system (like GNU or GNU/Linux).  Look at the
<a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/porting/PORTING">porting</a>
document for details.</p>

<p>If you want to help porting packages, look at our
<a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/patches/">patches</a>
directory first to ensure you don't repeat already done work. (Please don't
submit patches from our directory, many of them are not ready to be sent.)</p>

<p>Also look at the <a href="http://glibc-bsd.alioth.debian.org/TODO">TODO</a>
file for more details on what needs to be done.</p>

<h2>Available Hardware for Debian Developers</h2>

<p>asdfasdf.debian.org (kfreebsd-amd64) and io.debian.net (kfreebsd-i386) are 
available to Debian developers for porting work.  Please see the 
<a href="http://db.debian.org/machines.cgi">machine database</a> for more
information about these machines.  In general, you will be able to use the
two chroot environments: testing and unstable. Note that these systems 
are not yet administrated by DSA, so <b>do not send requests to debian-admin 
about it</b>. Instead use <email "admin@asdfasdf.debian.net"> or 
<email "admin@io.debian.net">.</p>
