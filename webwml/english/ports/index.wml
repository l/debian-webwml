<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up (there is work being done to port Linux to 286, and earlier,
 machines. See the
<a href="http://www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">ELKS project</a>
 for more information).
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.
 Following close behind, we have ported the Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Debian is an OS, not a kernel (actually, it is more than an OS since it
 includes thousands of application programs).  To
 prove this, we have our first two fledgling non-Linux based ports, listed
 <a href="#nonlinux">at the bottom of this page</a>.
</p>
<p>
 <i>Warning</i> - this is a page in progress.  Not all ports have
 pages yet, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 collecting information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.
</p>

<h2><a name="released">Released Ports</a></h2>

<p>The following ports were included in at least one Debian stable release.

<h3><a href="i386/">Intel x86 (``i386'')</a></h3>
<p>
 The first architecture, and not strictly a port.  As Debian's website
 adjusts from the traditional i386-centric view of Linux to a more
 balanced one, any i386 specific information will be moved here.
</p>

<h3><a href="m68k/">Motorola 68k (``m68k'')</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.0.
 The most established port after the Intel x86.
 The Debian m68k port runs on a wide variety
 of computers based on the Motorola 68k series of processors - in
 particular, the Sun3 range of workstations, the Apple Macintosh
 personal computers, and the Atari and Amiga personal computers.
</p>

<h3><a href="sparc/">Sun SPARC (``sparc'')</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 This port runs on the Sun SPARCstation series of workstations, as well
 as some of their successors in the sun4 architectures.
</p>

<h3><a href="alpha/">Alpha (``alpha'')</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 One of the longer standing ports, and quite stable.
</p>

<h3><a href="powerpc/">Motorola/IBM PowerPC (``powerpc'')</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.2.
 This port runs on many of the Apple Macintosh PowerMac models,
 on the CHRP and PReP open architecture machines.
</p>

<h3><a href="arm/">ARM (``arm'')</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.2.
 A new porting effort, spurred into life by Corel's interesting
 NetWinder machine.
</p>

<h2><a name="unreleased">Ports that haven't been released yet</a></h2>

<p>The following ports never took part in a Debian stable release, but they
should appear in one, eventually.

<h3><a href="sparc64/">Sun UltraSPARC (``sparc64'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port to the Sun UltraSPARC (sun4u)
 series of workstations.  This 64-bit processor has the advantage of
 backward compatibility with its predecessor, so the UltraSPARC port
 will be able to run SPARC binaries.
</p>

<h3><a href="mips/">MIPS CPUs (``mips'' and ``mipsel'')</a></h3>
<p>
 Debian is being ported to the MIPS architecture which is
 used in SGI machines (debian-mips - big-endian) and Digital DECstations
 (debian-mipsel - little-endian).
 We intend to release these two architectures with `woody'.
</p>

<h3><a href="hppa/">HP PA-RISC (``hppa'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port to Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC architecture, and it is in
 an advanced stage. We intend to release it with `woody'.
</p>

<h3><a href="ia64/">IA-64 (``ia64'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port to Intel's 64-bit architecture.
 We intend to release it with `woody'.
</p>

<h3><a href="s390/">S/390 (``s390'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port to IBM S/390 servers. We plan to release this port with
 `woody'.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.m17n.org/linux-sh/debian/">SuperH (``sh'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a fairly new port to Hitachi SuperH processors.
</p>

<h2><a name="nonlinux">Non-Linux ports</a></h2>

<h3><a href="hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd (``hurd-i386'')</a></h3>
<p>
 The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by
 the GNU group.  In fact, the GNU Hurd is the final component which
 makes it possible to built an entirely GNU OS -- and Debian GNU/Hurd
 is going to be one such (possibly even the first) GNU OS.  The
 current project is founded on the i386 architecture, but expect the
 others to follow soon.
</p>

<h3><a href="netbsd/">Debian GNU/NetBSD (``netbsd-i386'' and ``netbsd-alpha'')</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port of the Debian operating system, complete with apt, dpkg,
 and GNU userland, to the NetBSD kernel. It is currently in a very
 preliminary stage, but since NetBSD is a production-level kernel, the
 usability of Debian GNU/NetBSD should increase rapidly. Currently Debian
 GNU/NetBSD for Intel x86 is the most advanced flavor, but work has also
 begun on supporting Alpha-based computers.
</p>

<h2><a name="various">Various port-like projects</a></h2>

<p><em>Although these efforts aren't exactly ports, this seemed like a good
place to put them.</em>

<h3><a href="beowulf/">Debian Beowulf</a></h3>
<p>
 Beowulf is a replacement for some of the larger
 mega computers used in the science and math fields. This project aims to run Beowulf clusters on Debian
 machines and to network the <I>people</I> involved in true bazaar fashion.
