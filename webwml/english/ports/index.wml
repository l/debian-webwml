<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up (there was a version ported to the 286, but Linux's
 virtual memory code relies on the existence of a special chip called
 an MMU, which was not present on 286 machines).
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.  And,
 following close behind, we have ported our Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Furthermore, Debian is primarily an OS, not a kernel.  And just to
 prove this, we have our first fledging non-Linux based port, listed
 at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
 <i>Warning</i> - this is a page in progress.  Not all ports yet have
 pages, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.
</p>

<h2>Intel x86</h2>
<p>
 The first architecture, and not strictly a port.  As Debian's website
 adjusts from the traditional i386-centric view of Linux to a more
 balanced one, any i386 specific information will be moved here.
</p>

<h2><a href="alpha/">DEC Alpha</a></h2>
<p>
 One of the longer standing ports, and quite stable now.  Expected to
 release with Debian 2.1.
</p>

<h2><a href="arm/">ARM</a></h2>
<p>
 A new porting effort, spurred into life by Corel's interesting
 NetWinder machine.
</p>

<h2><a href="m68k/">Motorola 68k</a></h2>
<p>
 The most established port after the Intel x86.  The only other to
 release with Debian 2.0.  The Debian m68k port runs on a wide variety
 of computers based on the Motorola 68k series of processors - in
 particular, the Sun3 range of workstations, the Apple Macintosh
 personal computers, and the Atari and Amiga personal computers.
</p>

<h2><a href="mips/"MIPS</a></h2>
<p>
  There has been some work in porting debian to the MIPS architecture,
    used in SGI machines.  If you have an SGI, and are
    interesting in furthering the port effort, please send an email to 
    <a href="mailto:debian-mips@lists.debian.org">debian-mips@lists.debian.org</a>.
</p>

<h2><a href="powerpc/">Motorola/IBM PowerPC</a></h2>
<p>
 This port runs on many of the Apple Macintosh 'PowerMac' computers,
 and may also run on some Motorola machines.  It draws from
 the <a href="http://www.linuxppc.org/">LinuxPPC</a> and
 <a href="http://www.mklinux.apple.com/">MkLinux</a> projects.
</p>

<h2><a href="sparc/">Sun SPARC</a></h2>
<p>
 This port runs on the powerful (and less powerful ;-) Sun
 SPARCstation series of workstations, as well as some of their
 successors in the sun4 architectures.  We hope to release this with
 Debian 2.1.
</p>

<h2>Sun UltraSPARC</h2>
<p>
 There is also the beginnings of a port to the Sun UltraSPARC (sun4u)
 series of workstations.  This 64bit processor has the advantage of
 backward compatibility with its predecessor, so the ultrasparc port
 will be able to run sparc binaries.  This project currently needs
 developers.  If you have an Ultra-based machine, and would like to
 help, please send a message to the list at
 <a href="mailto:debian-ultralinux@lists.debian.org">debian-ultralinux@lists.debian.org</a>
 offering your services.
</p>

<h2><a href="http://master.debian.org/~brinkmd/hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd</a></h2>
<p>
 The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by
 the GNU group.  In fact, the GNU Hurd is the final component which
 makes it possibly to built an entirely GNU OS - and Debian GNU/Hurd
 is going to be one such (possibly even the first) GNU OS.  The
 current project is founded on the i386 architecture, but expect the
 others to follow soon after...
