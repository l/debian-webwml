<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up (there is work being done to port Linux to 286, and earlier,
 machines. See the
<a href="http://elks.sourceforge.net/">ELKS project</a>
 for more information).
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.
 Following close behind, we have ported the Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Debian is an operating system (OS), not a kernel (actually, it is more
 than an OS since it includes thousands of application programs). Accordingly,
 while most Debian ports are based on Linux, there also are ports based on the
 FreeBSD, NetBSD and Hurd kernels.
</p>
<p>
 <em>Warning</em> &mdash; this is a page in progress.  Not all ports have
 pages yet, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 collecting information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.
</p>

<h2 id="released">Released Ports</h2>

<p>The following ports were included in at least one Debian stable release.</p>

<h3><a href="i386/">Intel x86 / IA-32 (<q>i386</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 The first architecture, and not strictly a port. Linux was originally
 developed for the Intel 386 processors, hence the short name.  Debian supports
 all IA-32 processors, made by Intel (including all Pentium series and recent
 Core Duo machines in 32 bit mode), AMD (K6, all Athlon series,
 Athlon64 series in 32 bit mode), Cyrix and other manufacturers.
 <br />
 As Debian's website
 adjusts from the traditional i386-centric view of Linux to a more
 balanced one, any i386 specific information will be moved here.
</p>

<h3><a href="m68k/">Motorola 68k (<q>m68k</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.0.
 The port failed to make the release criteria for Debian 4.0
 and has therefore not been included in Etch and later releases.
 The Debian m68k port runs on a wide variety
 of computers based on the Motorola 68k series of processors &mdash; in
 particular, the Sun3 range of workstations, the Apple Macintosh
 personal computers, and the Atari and Amiga personal computers.
</p>

<h3><a href="sparc/">Sun SPARC (<q>sparc</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 This port runs on the Sun SPARCstation series of workstations, as well
 as some of their successors in the sun4 architectures.
</p>

<h3><a href="alpha/">Alpha (<q>alpha</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 One of the longer standing ports, and quite stable.
</p>

<h3><a href="powerpc/">Motorola/IBM PowerPC (<q>powerpc</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.2.
 This port runs on many of the Apple Macintosh PowerMac models, and
 on the CHRP and PReP open architecture machines.
</p>

<h3><a href="arm/">ARM (<q>arm</q> and <q>armel</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 This port runs on a variety of embedded hardware, like routers or NAS
 devices. The arm port was first released with Debian 2.2, and was supported
 up to and including Debian 5.0. Armel (first released with Debian 5.0) is the
 more efficient successor for the <q>arm</q> port, which is compatible with
 the ARM EABI. These ports target machines with ARMv4t based CPU or newer and
 without a floating point unit.
</p>

<h3><a href="mips/">MIPS CPUs (<q>mips</q> and <q>mipsel</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 3.0.
 Debian is being ported to the MIPS architecture which is
 used in SGI machines (debian-mips &mdash; big-endian) and Digital DECstations
 (debian-mipsel &mdash; little-endian).
</p>

<h3><a href="hppa/">HP PA-RISC (<q>hppa</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 3.0.
 This is a port to Hewlett-Packard's PA-RISC architecture, and it is in
 an advanced stage.
</p>

<h3><a href="ia64/">IA-64 (<q>ia64</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 3.0.
 This is a port to Intel's first 64-bit architecture.
 Note: this should <em>not</em> be confused with the latest Intel 64-bit
 extensions for Pentium 4 and Celeron processors, called EM64T; for these,
 see the <a href="amd64/">AMD64</a> port.
</p>

<h3><a href="s390/">S/390 (<q>s390</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 3.0.
 This is a port to IBM S/390 servers.
</p>

<h3><a href="amd64/">AMD64 (<q>amd64</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 4.0.
 Port to the 64 bit AMD64 processors. The goal is to
 support both 32bit- and 64bit-userland on this architecture.
 This port supports AMD's 64-bit Opteron, Athlon and Sempron processors,
 and Intel's processors with EM64T support, including the Pentium&nbsp;D and
 various Xeon and Core2 series.
</p>

<h3><a href="kfreebsd-gnu/">Debian GNU/kFreeBSD (<q>kfreebsd-i386</q> and <q>kfreebsd-amd64</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 6.0 as a technology preview
 and the first non-Linux port released by Debian.
 Port of the Debian GNU system to the kernel of FreeBSD.  It is
 available for both 32 bit and 64 bit x86 processors.
</p>

<h2 id="unreleased">Ports that haven't been released yet</h2>

<p>The following ports never took part in a Debian stable release, but they
should appear in one, eventually.</p>

<h3><a href="http://debian-ppc64.alioth.debian.org/">ppc64</a></h3>
<p>
 Port to the 64 bit PPC64 architecture with a complete 64-bit
 user space.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.linux-sh.org/shwiki/FrontPage">SuperH (<q>sh</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 A fairly new port to Hitachi SuperH processors.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ArmHardFloatPort">armhf</a></h3>
<p>
 Port to big-endian ARM machines, especially to Linksys NSLU2.
 A lot of modern ARM boards and devices ship with a floating-point unit (FPU),
 but the current Debian armel port doesn't take much advantage og it. The
 armhf port was started to improve this situation and also take advantage of
 other features of newer ARM CPUs.  The Debian armhf port requires at least an
 ARMv7 CPU with Thumb2 and VFP3D16 coprocessor.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.linux-m32r.org/">m32r</a></h3>
<p>
 Port to the 32-bit RISC microprocessor of Renesas Technology.
</p>

<h3><a href="http://avr32.debian.net/">AVR32</a></h3>
<p>
 Port to Atmel's 32-bit RISC architecture, AVR32.
</p>

<h3><a href="hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd (<q>hurd-i386</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by
 the GNU group.  In fact, the GNU Hurd is the final component which
 makes it possible to built an entirely GNU OS &mdash; and Debian GNU/Hurd
 is going to be one such (possibly even the first) GNU OS.  The
 current project is founded on the i386 architecture, but expect the
 others to follow soon.
</p>

<h3><a href="netbsd/">Debian GNU/NetBSD (<q>netbsd-i386</q> and <q>netbsd-alpha</q>)</a></h3>
<p>
 This is a port of the Debian operating system, complete with apt, dpkg,
 and GNU userland, to the NetBSD kernel. It is currently in a very
 preliminary stage, but since NetBSD is a production-level kernel, the
 usability of Debian GNU/NetBSD should increase rapidly. Currently Debian
 GNU/NetBSD for Intel x86 is the most advanced flavor, but work has also
 begun on supporting Alpha-based computers.
</p>

<h2 id="various">Various port-like projects</h2>

<p><em>Although these efforts aren't exactly ports, this seemed like a good
place to put them.</em></p>

<h3><a href="beowulf/">Debian Beowulf</a></h3>
<p>
 Beowulf is a replacement for some of the larger
 mega computers used in the science and math fields. This project aims to run
 Beowulf clusters on Debian machines and to network the <em>people</em> involved in true
 <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/">bazaar</a> fashion.
