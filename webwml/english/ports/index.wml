<toc-add-entry name="intro">Introduction</toc-add-entry>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up.
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.
 Following close behind, we have ported the Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Debian is an operating system (OS), not a kernel (actually, it is more
 than an OS since it includes thousands of application programs). Accordingly,
 while most Debian ports are based on Linux, there also are ports based on the
 FreeBSD, NetBSD and Hurd kernels.
</p>

<div class="important">
<p>
 This is a page in progress.  Not all ports have
 pages yet, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 collecting information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.
 More ports may be <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/CategoryPorts">listed</a> on the wiki.

<td><a href="amd64/">amd64</a></td>
<td>64-bit PC (amd64)</td>
<td>First officially released with Debian 4.0. Port to 64-bit x86
processors. The goal is to support both 32-bit and 64-bit userland on this
architecture. This port supports AMD's 64-bit Opteron, Athlon and Sempron
processors, and Intel's processors with Intel 64 support, including the
Pentium D and various Xeon and Core series.</td>

instruction set. Since Debian 8.0, the arm64 port has been included in
Debian to support this new instruction set on processors such as the
Applied Micro X-Gene, AMD Seattle and Cavium ThunderX.</td>

<td>Hard Float ABI ARM</td>
<td>A lot of modern 32-bit ARM boards and devices ship with a floating-point
unit (FPU), but the Debian armel port doesn't take much advantage
of it. The armhf port was started to improve this situation and also take
advantage of other features of newer ARM CPUs. The Debian armhf port
requires at least an ARMv7 CPU with Thumb-2 and VFP3-D16 floating point
support.</td>

developed for the Intel 386 processors, hence the short name. Debian
supports all IA-32 processors, made by Intel (including all Pentium
series and recent Core Duo machines in 32-bit mode), AMD (K6, all Athlon
series, Athlon64 series in 32-bit mode), Cyrix and other
