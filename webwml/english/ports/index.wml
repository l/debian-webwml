<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up (there is work being done to port Linux to 286, and earlier,
 machines. See the
<a href="http://www.elks.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">ELKS project</a>
 for more information).
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.
 Following close behind, we have ported the Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Debian is an OS, not a kernel (actually, it is more than an OS since it
 includes over 1000 application programs).  To
 prove this, we have our first fledgling non-Linux based port, listed
 at the bottom of this page.
</p>
<p>
 <i>Warning</i> - this is a page in progress.  Not all ports have
 pages yet, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 collecting information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.
</p>

<h2>Intel x86 (``i386'')</h2>
<p>
 The first architecture, and not strictly a port.  As Debian's website
 adjusts from the traditional i386-centric view of Linux to a more
 balanced one, any i386 specific information will be moved here.
</p>

<h2><a href="alpha/">Alpha (``alpha'')</a></h2>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 One of the longer standing ports, and quite stable.
</p>

<h2><a href="arm/">ARM (``arm'')</a></h2>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.2.
 A new porting effort, spurred into life by Corel's interesting
 NetWinder machine.
</p>

<h2><a href="m68k/">Motorola 68k (``m68k'')</a></h2>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.0.
 The most established port after the Intel x86.
 The Debian m68k port runs on a wide variety
 of computers based on the Motorola 68k series of processors - in
 particular, the Sun3 range of workstations, the Apple Macintosh
 personal computers, and the Atari and Amiga personal computers.
</p>

<h2><a href="mips/">MIPS CPUs ("mips" and "mipsel")</a></h2>
<p>
 There has been some work in porting debian to the MIPS architecture,
 used in SGI machines (debian-mips - big endian) and Digital Decstations
 (debian-mipsel - little endian).
</p>

<h2><a href="hppa/">HP PA-RISC</a></h2>
<p>
 A port of Debian GNU/Linux to the PA-RISC architecture is just getting started.
</p>


<h2><a href="powerpc/">Motorola/IBM PowerPC (``powerpc'')</a></h2>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.2.
 This port runs on many of the Apple Macintosh PowerMac models,
 on the CHRP and PReP open architecture machines.
</p>

<h2><a href="sparc/">Sun SPARC (``sparc'')</a></h2>
<p>
 First officially released with Debian 2.1.
 This port runs on the Sun SPARCstation series of workstations, as well
 as some of their successors in the sun4 architectures.
</p>

<h2><a href="sparc64/">Sun UltraSPARC (``sparc64'')</a></h2>
<p>
 This is a port to the Sun UltraSPARC (sun4u)
 series of workstations.  This 64-bit processor has the advantage of
 backward compatibility with its predecessor, so the UltraSPARC port
 will be able to run SPARC binaries.  This project currently needs
 developers.  If you have an Ultra-based machine, and would like to
 help, please send a message to the list at
 <a href="mailto:debian-ultralinux@lists.debian.org">debian-ultralinux@lists.debian.org</a>
 offering your services.
</p>

<h2><a href="hurd/">Debian GNU/Hurd (``hurd-i386'')</a></h2>
<p>
 The GNU Hurd is a totally new operating system being put together by
 the GNU group.  In fact, the GNU Hurd is the final component which
 makes it possible to built an entirely GNU OS -- and Debian GNU/Hurd
 is going to be one such (possibly even the first) GNU OS.  The
 current project is founded on the i386 architecture, but expect the
 others to follow soon.
</p>

<h2><a href="beowulf/">Debian Beowulf</a></h2>
<p>
 Although not specificly a port, Beowulf is a replacement for some of the larger
 mega computers used in the the science and math fields.  This seemed like a
 good place to put it.  This project aims to run Beowulf clusters on Debian
 machines and to network the <I>people</I> involved in true bazaar fashion.
