<toc-add-entry name="intro">Introduction</toc-add-entry>
<p>
 As most of you know, <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">Linux</a>
 is just a kernel.  And, for a long time,
 the Linux kernel ran only on the Intel x86 series of machines, from
 the 386 up.
</p>
<p>
 However, this is no longer true, by any means.  The Linux kernel has
 now been ported to a large, and growing, list of architectures.
 Following close behind, we have ported the Debian distribution to
 these architectures.  In general, this is a process with a sticky
 start (as we get libc and the dynamic linker working smoothly), and
 then a relatively routine, if lengthy job, of attempting to recompile
 all our packages under the new architectures.
</p>
<p>
 Debian is an operating system (OS), not a kernel (actually, it is more
 than an OS since it includes thousands of application programs). Accordingly,
 while most Debian ports are based on Linux, there also are ports based on the
 FreeBSD, NetBSD and Hurd kernels.
</p>

<p>
 This is a page in progress.  Not all ports have
 pages yet, and most of them are on external sites.  We are working on
 collecting information on all ports, to be mirrored along with the Debian
 website.

<td>First officially released with Debian 4.0. Port to the 64 bit AMD64
processors. The goal is to support both 32bit- and 64bit-userland on this
architecture. This port supports AMD's 64-bit Opteron, Athlon and Sempron
processors, and Intel's processors with EM64T support, including the
Pentium D and various Xeon and Core2 series.</td>

developed for the Intel 386 processors, hence the short name. Debian
supports all IA-32 processors, made by Intel (including all Pentium
series and recent Core Duo machines in 32 bit mode), AMD (K6, all Athlon

first 64-bit architecture. Note: this should not be confused with the
latest Intel 64-bit extensions for Pentium 4 and Celeron processors,
called EM64T; for these, see the AMD64 port.</td>
