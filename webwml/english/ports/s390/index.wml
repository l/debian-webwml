<h1>Debian for S/390 and zSeries</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>S/390 has been an officially  supported Debian architecture since the release
of Debian 3.0 (woody).</p>

<p>For instructions on installing Debian, see the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/s390/">Installation Guide</a>.
Unfortunately for Sarge it is not possible to ipl the installation system off
an installation CD, but several other installation methods are supported. Support
to ipl off an installation CD has been added back in the version of the installer
that will be released with Etch.</p>

# Frans Pop 20050811: Not sure about this, disabling for now
# There is also support for the non-free
# <a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390/">OCO
# modules from IBM</a> using a second initial RAM disk but these modules are
# not distributed by Debian and probably never will be.</p>

# MJ Ray 20080411: Page now 404 Not Found - was a postnuke
#<p>Our development partner <a href="http://www.trustsec.de/">trustsec</a> has
#created a <a href="http://www.trustsec.de/deb390/">Web portal</a> for Debian on
#S/390 and z/Series. You'll find the latest news, FAQs, downloads and a
#lot of useful web links there.</p>
