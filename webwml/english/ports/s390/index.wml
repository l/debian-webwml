<h1>Debian for S/390 and zSeries</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>S/390 is now a supported Debian architecture! </p>

<p>The normal Debian channels for acquiring installation media should 
have S/390 available shortly, now that Debian 3.0 (woody) is released.</p>

<p>The first version of the boot-floppies that supported s390 was 3.0.14
using kernel 2.4.7. Newer 
<a href="ftp://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/dists/woody/main/disks-s390/current/">
boot-floppies</a> since 3.0.18 use kernel 2.4.16
which also supports the ext3 journaling file system on s390. There is also
support for the non-free
<a href="http://www10.software.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/linux390/">OCO
modules from IBM</a> using a second initial RAM disk but these modules are
not distributed by Debian and probably never will be.</p>

<p>Our development partner <a href="http://www.trustsec.de/">trustsec</a> has
created a <a href="http://www.trustsec.de/deb390/">Web portal</a> for Debian on
S/390 and z/Series. You'll find the latest news, FAQs, downloads and a
lot of useful web links there.</p>
