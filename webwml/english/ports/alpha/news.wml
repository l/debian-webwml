<p><b>10 March 1999</b></p>
<p>New page format!<br>
I've been thinking of changing this set of web pages for awhile now and
finally got around to making most of the modifications that I was thinking
of.  Expect more changes, but this is probably the final format.</p>

<p><b>9 March 1999</b></p>
<p>Slink Released - Debian 2.1 for Alpha Ships With It!<br>
That's right, slink has been released officially as Debian 2.1.
The release now includes the Alpha port, so bang on it, abuse it,
break it, and then let us know what failed :-)  Seriously, though,
I personally feel that the work that we have accomplished is first-rate
and definitely release-worthy.  If anything doesn't work, please
post to the debian-alpha mailing list and also post a bug report
detailing your problems so we can improve the quality of the packages
that we ship out.</p>

<p>Glibc 2.1 is almost here!<br>
The maintainer of glibc 2.1 and I have been working together to
resolve the few remaining major issues for glibc 2.1.  I'm currently
expecting a new egcs package from him and, once I get that compiled,
a set of glibc 2.1 debs will hit master.  Joel will make the official
announcement for the upload, fyi.<br>
I have made an announcement to the debian-alpha list, though, basically
asking for a voluntary suspension of Alpha uploads to master for potato
until all of the glibc 2.1 debs are installed.  This will prevent having
to recompile a bunch of things which may need some modifications anyway.
Basically, I just wanted to save everyone some extra work that would
just be replaced anyway :-)

<P><B><CENTER>Now that slink has been released, I'm changing the 
Release Checklist page into the 
<A HREF="glibc21-page">Glibc 2.1 on Alpha Page</A>.
</CENTER></B></p>
