<h1>News about Debian for Alpha</h1>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2002-05-21"):></h3>

<p>Woody is nearing release (finally) and we're all looking forward
to it!  Other than many bugfixes and the usual benefits that woody
carries for all architectures (newer XFree86 versions and such since
potato), not much has changed for Alpha.  2.4 kernel support has been
improved during the prerelease cycle and only one major kernel bug
that remains unresolved affects Alpha (patch going to BTS within the
week - only applies to SMP kernels).</p>

<p>As for sid, we're on the brink of many exciting changes.  I've
managed to bootstrap gcc 3.1 with the Ada compiler on Alpha.  This
new revision not only provides us with an Ada compiler (finally),
but also seems to be much improved over 2.95.x and 3.0.x.  At the
time of this writing, gcc-3.1 packages are uploaded, but not in the
main archive as of yet.  This, of course, should change within a week
or two, so be patient and you will be rewarded.  Also, there are plans
to get XFree86 4.2.x packaged soon (the less you pester Branden about
this, the faster it will happen, btw :-P), which promises improved
support and performance on Alpha.  We still have a bit before all of
these plans become totally integrated into sid, but it promises many
improvements once everything shakes out.</p>

<p>On a personal note, many apologies for not having updated these
pages in so long.  I've had quite a few personal setbacks recently
and am still a bit overloaded with non-Debian issues, but I'm trying
my best to climb back in the saddle and keep things more current.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2001-08-13"):></h3>

<p>Experimental boot floppies for Woody have been created and are
available at <a href="http://people.debian.org/~falk/disks-alpha/">http://people.debian.org/~falk/disks-alpha/</a>. Please test
them and send your reports to debian-boot@lists.debian.org!<br>
Thanks to Falk Hueffner for finding the time to take over the
boot floppies on Alpha</p>

<p>In other news, I've been trying to resolve some ugly toolchain
issues on Alpha.  I'm building a version of gcc-2.95 now that I'm
hoping will resolve quite a few issues, including why <code>binutils</code> is
suddenly having problems on Alpha only.  Rest assured that, if I
can't seem to resolve the problems, I'm definitely working on it
until I can, or at the very least, until we go ahead and compile the
dist with gcc-3.0.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2001-08-04"):></h3>

<p>Woody (Debian 3.0) has already entered its freeze process, a couple
of new architectures will be released with it.  Alpha, however, may
not be released unless new boot-floppies will be created.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-08-26"):></h3>

<p>I'm updating the list of Alpha types and codenames.  I received
a few corrections, so I decided, rather than correcting the existing
document, to post a much-modified version from the Hurd-Alpha project.
I'm also adding a link in the Links section to the project in case
someone wants to help out or has some information/equipment that they
can give.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-08-15"):></h3>

<p>Potato is RELEASED!  Get it while it's hot!  Congratulations to
everyone who put hard work into getting things ready for this moment.
</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-08-10"):></h3>

<p>I've added a list of Alpha system names and codenames to help
newer users figure out which type of Alpha that they have so that
they can configure their kernel correctly.  Seems that other lists
weren't complete, unfortunately.  Thanks to Ron Farrer for
contributing the page and list.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-08-06"):></h3>

<p>This is slightly off-topic, but it seems that a port of the
GNU HURD is being looked into.  Right now, there is not much status
to speak of, but I'm expecting to have a link to post soon for
those who want to get involved or are interested in helping this
effort along.  The only thing happening at the moment is the
preliminary work needed to incorporate some old Mach sources for
ancient Alpha platform support into the gnumach tree, so don't
expect any serious progress for a bit...<br>
<b>UPDATE:</b> Check out <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hurd-alpha/">\
http://sourceforge.net/projects/hurd-alpha</A> for more information this
new port</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-07-29"):></h3>

<p>AGAIN, it looks like potato is nearly released.  We're in
a test cycle now that we all hope will be the last.  I've found
and fixed a few bugs (GnomeICU and a few others), but haven't
gotten them into the archive at this time.  If the regular
maintainers don't respond soon, I'll NMU the packages and go
from there.  Potato's release is expected to be announced at
the LinuxWorld Conference and Expo.</p>

<p>While not being directly related to the Alpha port, we're
all still mourning the loss of one of Debian's hardest working
maintainers (and a good friend), Joel "Espy" Klecker.  So many
beginners and experienced maintainers alike received assistance
from Joel and he'll be sorely missed.  Because of this, we
at Debian are dedicating the potato release to his memory.  For
(slightly) more info, please 
<A HREF="http://http.us.debian.org/debian/doc/dedication-2.2.txt">\
read the dedication notice</A>.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("2000-06-01"):></h3>

<p>Sorry for the delay (lost the password for updating these
pages).  Good news is that "potato" is currently frozen and
nearing release!  This promises to be MUCH better than slink
was (and slink was pretty darn good) for Alpha and supports
more software than ever before.  I'll keep you posted on a
release date when I get it.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-10-26"):></h3>

<p>Well, there's not much new to say other than the porting
efforts continue at a whirlwind pace.  We're currently
autobuilding about 90% or more of the current Debian packages
with the heavy-hitters being built by hand (glibc, gcc, etc.)
for testing and reliability reasons.  I've also noticed quite
a few developers moving to Alpha, so we're expecting even less
compatibility issues than ever before.  I've also gotten word
that snmpwalk under potato is fully functional (after the
spotty results under slink in the past) as are a number of other
packages.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-07-06"):></h3>

<p>Just Added: Links to Local Copies of SRM/MILO/AlphaBIOS HOWTOs<br>
Well, after some spotty connections over at www.alphalinux.org, I've
decided to mirror the "most important documents" (SRM, MILO, and
AlphaBIOS HOWTO documents) here.  I'll be running the mirror by hand
for awhile, but will eventually make it automatic if needed.  After
speaking with the web gods over at www.alphalinux.org, I've gotten
word that they're working on making things more reliable and that
things should improve immensely over there shortly.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-06-07"):></h3>

<p>Mozilla debs uploaded for potato<br>
After a brief testing period, I've uploaded debs for Mozilla M6 for
Alphas running Potato.  While there are still some problems (unadorned
windows, menuless mail window, etc.), the browser appears pretty solid
and is currently our best browser, in my opinion.  A word of warning,
java support is NOT compiled in by choice of the maintainer of the
mozilla package.  I will be testing this in my spare time (in other
words, it will take me a month or two to get to it&lt;g&gt;) and maybe
we'll get java support into it shortly.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL does, in fact, work<br>
After MUCH testing and code browsing (not to mention installing about
16 different revisions of the debs), Bart and I have actually found
a way to get PostgreSQL to work.  Unfortunately, it's very ugly.  In
short, there are still optimisation issues with egcs that miscompile
the spinlock routines in PostgreSQL.  I've compiled the package sans
optimisation and it still bombed.  Well, I've traced the problem
(dubbed the "palloc error from hell") back to a patch added by the
maintainer.  This means that the only way to get a working installation
of PostgreSQL on an Alpha currently is to hand-build it from upstream
source making sure to remove any instance of "-O2" from the tree.
If anyone wants to do this, please download
<A HREF="postgresql-noopt.diff.gz">this patch</A> and apply it.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-05-04"):></h3>

<p>PCMCIA tools and modules for 2.2.1 uploaded for potato testing<br>
I just compiled the latest pcmcia-cs package for PCMCIA support (very
few Alphas actually have PCMCIA slots/controllers built-in, FYI).
During my (very) brief testing of the package, everything seems to work
really well.  Keep in mind that I don't have ANY devices to test it with,
though, so please stress-test it with your hardware and e-mail the 
debian-alpha list with any problem reports.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-04-15"):></h3>

<p>Glibc 2.1 change-over continues<br>
Well, nothing really new to report except that we're about to get a new
iteration of the glibc 2.1.1 packages that include a boatload of patches
(I won't even go into them here).  It may take a week or more, however,
since I have to recompile a few supporting packages prior to compiling
the monster that is glibc (FYI, egcs needs to be recompiled too due to a
new iteration of those packages as well and I'd like to do that first).</p>

<p>Other than that, nothing new to report.  The release of Debian 2.1 for
Alpha has apparently gone over well since we've received very few problem
reports with packages (all that I've seen have been dealt with rather
easily).  I consider this to be a great "victory" of sorts :-)</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-03-10"):></h3>

<p>New page format!<br>
I've been thinking of changing this set of web pages for awhile now and
finally got around to making most of the modifications that I was thinking
of.  Expect more changes, but this is probably the final format.</p>

<h3><:=spokendate ("1999-03-09"):></h3>

<p>Slink released - Debian 2.1 for Alpha ships with it!<br>
That's right, slink has been released officially as Debian 2.1.
The release now includes the Alpha port, so bang on it, abuse it,
break it, and then let us know what failed :-)  Seriously, though,
I personally feel that the work that we have accomplished is first-rate
and definitely release-worthy.  If anything doesn't work, please
post to the debian-alpha mailing list and also post a bug report
detailing your problems so we can improve the quality of the packages
that we ship out.</p>

<p>Glibc 2.1 is almost here!<br>
The maintainer of glibc 2.1 and I have been working together to
resolve the few remaining major issues for glibc 2.1.  I'm currently
expecting a new egcs package from him and, once I get that compiled,
a set of glibc 2.1 debs will hit master.  Joel will make the official
announcement for the upload, fyi.<br>
I have made an announcement to the debian-alpha list, though, basically
asking for a voluntary suspension of Alpha uploads to master for potato
until all of the glibc 2.1 debs are installed.  This will prevent having
to recompile a bunch of things which may need some modifications anyway.
Basically, I just wanted to save everyone some extra work that would
just be replaced anyway :-)
