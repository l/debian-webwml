<p>Mozilla Debs Uploaded For Potato<br>
After a brief testing period, I've uploaded debs for Mozilla M6 for
Alphas running Potato.  While there are still some problems (unadorned
windows, menuless mail window, etc), the browser appears pretty solid
and is currently our best browser, in my opinion.  A word of warning,
java support is NOT compiled in by choice of the maintainer of the
mozilla package.  I will be testing this in my spare time (in other
words, it will take me a month or two to get to it<g>) and maybe
we'll get java support into it shortly.</p>

<p>PostgreSQL Does, In Fact, Work<br>
After MUCH testing and code browsing (not to mention installing about
16 different revisions of the debs), Bart and I have actually found
a way to get PostgreSQL to work.  Unfortunately, it's very ugly.  In
short, there are still optimisation issues with egcs that miscompile
the spinlock routines in PostgreSQL.  I've compiled the package sans
optimisation and it still bombed.  Well, I've traced the problem
(dubbed the "palloc error from hell") back to a patch added by the
maintainer.  This means that the only way to get a working installation
of PostgreSQL on an Alpha currently is to hand-build it from upstream
source making sure to remove any instance of "-O2" from the tree.
If anyone wants to do this, please download
<A HREF="postgresql-noopt.diff.gz">this patch</A> and apply it.</p>

<p>PCMCIA tools and modules for 2.2.1 uploaded for potato testing<br>
I just compiled the latest pcmcia-cs package for PCMCIA support (very
few Alphas actually have PCMCIA slots/controllers built-in, FYI).
During my (very) brief testing of the package, everything seems to work
really well.  Keep in mind that I don't have ANY devices to test it with,
though, so please stress-test it with your hardware and e-mail the 
debian-alpha list with any problem reports.</p>

<p>Glibc 2.1 Change-over Continues<br>
Well, nothing really new to report except that we're about to get a new
iteration of the glibc 2.1.1 packages that include a boatload of patches
(I won't even go into them here).  It may take a week or more, however,
since I have to recompile a few supporting packages prior to compiling
the monster that is glibc (FYI, egcs needs to be recompiled too due to a
new iteration of those packages as well and I'd like to do that first).</p>

<p>Other than that, nothing new to report.  The release of Debian 2.1 for
Alpha has apparently gone over well since we've received very few problem
reports with packages (all that I've seen have been dealt with rather
easily).  I consider this to be a great "victory" of sorts :-)</p>

<p>New page format!<br>
I've been thinking of changing this set of web pages for awhile now and
finally got around to making most of the modifications that I was thinking
of.  Expect more changes, but this is probably the final format.</p>

<p><b>9 March 1999</b></p>
<p>Slink Released - Debian 2.1 for Alpha Ships With It!<br>
That's right, slink has been released officially as Debian 2.1.
The release now includes the Alpha port, so bang on it, abuse it,
break it, and then let us know what failed :-)  Seriously, though,
I personally feel that the work that we have accomplished is first-rate
and definitely release-worthy.  If anything doesn't work, please
post to the debian-alpha mailing list and also post a bug report
detailing your problems so we can improve the quality of the packages
that we ship out.</p>

<p>Glibc 2.1 is almost here!<br>
The maintainer of glibc 2.1 and I have been working together to
resolve the few remaining major issues for glibc 2.1.  I'm currently
expecting a new egcs package from him and, once I get that compiled,
a set of glibc 2.1 debs will hit master.  Joel will make the official
announcement for the upload, fyi.<br>
I have made an announcement to the debian-alpha list, though, basically
asking for a voluntary suspension of Alpha uploads to master for potato
until all of the glibc 2.1 debs are installed.  This will prevent having
to recompile a bunch of things which may need some modifications anyway.
Basically, I just wanted to save everyone some extra work that would
just be replaced anyway :-)
