<h1>Debian-Alpha Release Checklist</h1>

<P>Well, we're right in the middle of the slink freeze for i386 and m68k.
Unfortunately, the Alpha dirs have not been frozen with it.  Why?  Don't know.
At any rate, it's irrelevant since we still intend to release :-)</P>

<P>This having been said, we still have a few things that need to be done
prior to release.  Here's the game plan currently:</P>

<ul>

<li><b>Installation Documentation</b><br>
Alot of work has been done on this (thanks to many participants on the
debian-alpha list.  It's still a big priority, though (still have to iron
out the rough spots).  For a look at the current docs or to submit new
docs, see Marc's page at
<A HREF="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc">Marc's web page</A>.</li>

<li><b>Installation Testers</b><br>
Obviously, this is needed.  If at all possible, we need testing done on every
type of Alpha that Linux runs on (I know, high hopes, but worth a shot).  At
the very least, the common machines would be fine (Miata, LX, SX, UDB).  Also
SRM, AlphaBIOS, and ARC boot methods need to be tested (and documented...hint
hint).  So far,
<A HREF="mailto:thmsb@eangach.apana.org.au">Thomas Behrndt (UDB)</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:lpz@ornl.gov">Lawrence MacIntyre (LX)</A> have
volunteered their services and equipment for this.  Thank you both!
If anyone else wishes to volunteer for testing, please post on the
debian-alpha list.</li>

<li><b>Update and Finish Base Disk Set</b><br>
Loic is still hard at work on the install disks.  So far, we've all had
great results with the latest set (including me on a second UDB that I had
here).  Chris is still working on PCMCIA support (not as easy as it looks).
Once he gets things to compile, everything will be uploaded and available.
Now, to find some devices to test it with....</li>

<li><b>Compile and Update Remaining Packages</b><br>
Alot of new Alpha developers are helping with this now and, as a result,
we're now down to under 90 packages that are still unbuilt (with most of
those needing serious porting work). Any other developers that wish to
join in the
frenzy, e-mail the debian-alpha list and get on Paul's mailing list for
the list of packages that are still unported (or just pick up quinn-diff).
</li>

</ul>

<h2><b>Other Thoughts and Notes</b></h2>

<P>Recently, dpkg exposed a bug/conflict between glibc and the unstable kernels.
The newest versions of glibc/libc6.1 (2.0.7u-4 and up) and dpkg (1.4.0.31 and up)
have been patched appropriately.<br>
<b>NOTE: The glibc packages MUST be installed prior to installation of dpkg-1.4.0.31 or
else dpkg will fail to work due to a missing lchown() call in older glibc's.</b>.</P>
