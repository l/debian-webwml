<h1>Debian-Alpha Release Checklist</h1>

<p>Alpha has been frozen with i386, m68k, and sparc for slink release.
At this time, it's looking like slink will go out of the door on 2 March.
I can't wait!  It's been a long hard road, but it's worth it!</P>

<P>This having been said, we still have a few things that need to be done
prior to release.  Here's the game plan currently:</P>

<ul>

<li><b>Installation Documentation</b><br>
We need to verify that this is complete as soon as possible.  If not,
please e-mail me (Chris Chimelis) and I'll see what I can do from here.
Alot of work has been done on this (thanks to many participants on the
debian-alpha list.  It's still a big priority, though (still have to iron
out the rough spots).  For a look at the current docs or to submit new
docs, see Marc's page at
<A HREF="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc">Marc's web page</A>.<br>
The docs on Marc's site are currently being incorporated into the
main Debian Installation Manual!  Great news all around and thanks
to everyone involved for the hard work.</li>

<li><b>Installation Testers</b><br>
Well, I can include myself in this category as well, having just reassembled
a Noname-based system.  Installation is very workable and easy.  There are
only a few things to iron out dependency-wise, but that's something for the
package compilers to handle (also me...hehehe).<br>
<br>
Having said that, if at all possible, we need more testing done on every
type of Alpha that Linux runs on (I know, high hopes, but worth a shot).  At
the very least, the common machines would be fine (Miata, LX, SX, UDB).  Also
SRM, AlphaBIOS, and ARC boot methods need to be tested (and documented...hint
hint).  So far,
<A HREF="mailto:thmsb@eangach.apana.org.au">Thomas Behrndt (UDB)</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:lpz@ornl.gov">Lawrence MacIntyre (LX)</A> have
volunteered their services and equipment for this.  Thank you both!
If anyone else wishes to volunteer for testing, please post on the
debian-alpha list.</li>

<li><b>Update and Finish Base Disk Set</b><br>
At last update, Loic is expected to have final disk sets VERY shortly.  The
last ones were great and perfect, IMO.</li>

<li><b>Compile and Update Remaining Packages</b><br>
Alot of new Alpha developers are helping with this now and, as a result,
we're now down to under 85 packages that are still unbuilt (with most,
if not all, of those needing serious porting work or which are arch-specific).
Any other developers that wish to join in the
frenzy, e-mail the debian-alpha list and get on Paul's mailing list for
the list of packages that are still unported (or just pick up quinn-diff).
</li>

</ul>

<h2><b>Other Thoughts and Notes</b></h2>

<P>I'm thoughtless!  Just kidding.  So far, I just wanted to give everyone
involved so far a HUGE cyber-pat on the back.  We've all worked very hard
on the upcoming release and I know it'll be fabulous :-)
</P>
