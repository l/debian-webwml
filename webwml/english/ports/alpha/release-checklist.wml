<h1>Debian-Alpha Release Checklist</h1>

<p>Alpha has been frozen with i386, m68k, and sparc for slink release.
Slink is definitely going out the door by 12 March and Alpha will roll with it.
I can't wait!  It's been a long hard road, but it's worth it!</P>

<p>Currently, as far as I can tell, all work for Slink has been concluded.
Thanks to all of you who have helped both in the development and in testing
our project :-)</p>

<h2><b>Other Thoughts and Notes</b></h2>

<P>I'm thoughtless!  Just kidding.  So far, I just wanted to give everyone
involved so far a HUGE cyber-pat on the back.  We've all worked very hard
on the upcoming release and I know it'll be fabulous :-)
</P>
