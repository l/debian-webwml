<h1>Debian-Alpha Release Checklist</h1>

<P>Mid-October brings the slink freeze deadline, as many of you know.
Since we've made tremendous progress on Debian-Alpha in the past few months,
we're gearing up for a release with slink (currently x86 and m68k are the
only released architectures).</P>

<P>With this in mind, several things need to be done before we actually
release Debian-Alpha.  Here's a game-plan that I recently posted on the
debian-alpha mailing list:</P>

<ul>

<li><b>Installation Documentation</b><br>
This is a huge priority.  Currently, Marc A. Volovic is involved in amassing
and converting documentation into SGML.  For some preliminary docs or to
submit some installation documentation about your Alpha machine type, see
<A HREF="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc">Marc's web page</A>.</li>

<li><b>Installation Testers</b><br>
Obviously, this is needed.  If at all possible, we need testing done on every
type of Alpha that Linux runs on (I know, high hopes, but worth a shot).  At
the very least, the common machines would be fine (Miata, LX, SX, UDB).  Also
SRM, AlphaBIOS, and ARC boot methods need to be tested (and documented...hint
hint).  So far,
<A HREF="mailto:thmsb@eangach.apana.org.au">Thomas Behrndt (UDB)</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:lpz@ornl.gov">Lawrence MacIntyre (LX)</A> have
volunteered their services and equipment for this.  Thank you both!
If anyone else wishes to volunteer for testing, please post on the
debian-alpha list.</li>

<li><b>Update and Finish Base Disk Set</b><br>
The last disk set was generated by Loic Prylli, who is still working on
this.  Once the egcs and binutils situations are resolved, Chris is going
to work heavily on PCMCIA support using the kernel that will be on the
kernel disk.  Just a note to Loic, are we still planning on putting
MILO and/or aboot on the boot disks?</li>

<li><b>Compile and Update Remaining Packages</b><br>
Chris, Paul Slootman, and Michael Dorman (in his microseconds of free time)
are mostly working on this.  Any other developers that wish to join in the
frenzy, e-mail the debian-alpha list and get on Paul's mailing list for
the list of packages that are still unported (or just pick up quinn-diff).
</li>

</ul>

<h2><b>Other Thoughts and Notes</b></h2>

<P>Recently, dpkg exposed a bug/conflict between glibc and the unstable kernels.
The newest versions of glibc/libc6.1 (2.0.7u-4 and up) and dpkg (1.4.0.31 and up)
have been patched appropriately.<br>
<b>NOTE: The glibc packages MUST be installed prior to installation of dpkg-1.4.0.31 or
else dpkg will fail to work due to a missing lchown() call in older glibc's.</b>.</P>
