<h1>Debian-Alpha Release Checklist</h1>

<p>Alpha has <b>finally</b> been frozen with i386 and m68k for slink release.
Because of the late change-over and the amount of changes, the mirrors haven't
had a chance to catch up yet, so be patient with them.  Also, master has been
having strange difficulty moving things to the newly frozen Alpha dir. This
is expected to be resolved by 5 December (if it hasn't been already).</P>

<P>This having been said, we still have a few things that need to be done
prior to release.  Here's the game plan currently:</P>

<ul>

<li><b>Installation Documentation</b><br>
Alot of work has been done on this (thanks to many participants on the
debian-alpha list.  It's still a big priority, though (still have to iron
out the rough spots).  For a look at the current docs or to submit new
docs, see Marc's page at
<A HREF="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc">Marc's web page</A>.<br>
The docs on Marc's site are currently being incorporated into the
main Debian Installation Manual!  Great news all around and thanks
to everyone involved for the hard work.</li>

<li><b>Installation Testers</b><br>
So far, we've had favourable test results with only a few minor problems
(RTC clock on some systems and lchown problems with dpkg on others due
to the use of an older kernel).  We anticipate having all of this fixed
<b>very</b> shortly as it's already being worked on.<br>
<br>
Having said that, if at all possible, we need testing done on every
type of Alpha that Linux runs on (I know, high hopes, but worth a shot).  At
the very least, the common machines would be fine (Miata, LX, SX, UDB).  Also
SRM, AlphaBIOS, and ARC boot methods need to be tested (and documented...hint
hint).  So far,
<A HREF="mailto:thmsb@eangach.apana.org.au">Thomas Behrndt (UDB)</A>
and <A HREF="mailto:lpz@ornl.gov">Lawrence MacIntyre (LX)</A> have
volunteered their services and equipment for this.  Thank you both!
If anyone else wishes to volunteer for testing, please post on the
debian-alpha list.</li>

<li><b>Update and Finish Base Disk Set</b><br>
Loic is still hard at work on the install disks.  So far, we've all had
great results with the latest set (including me on a second UDB that I had
here).  Chris got PCMCIA support to work using a few kernel versions and
has uploaded the pcmcia packages to master into potato (they were the
only ones that seemed to compile right...slink's versions didn't).  If
test results are favourable, the packages will be moved into frozen before
the distribution rolls out.</li>

<li><b>Compile and Update Remaining Packages</b><br>
Alot of new Alpha developers are helping with this now and, as a result,
we're now down to under 90 packages that are still unbuilt (with most of
those needing serious porting work). Any other developers that wish to
join in the
frenzy, e-mail the debian-alpha list and get on Paul's mailing list for
the list of packages that are still unported (or just pick up quinn-diff).
</li>

</ul>

<h2><b>Other Thoughts and Notes</b></h2>

<P>Recently, dpkg exposed a bug/conflict between glibc and the unstable kernels.
The newest versions of glibc/libc6.1 (2.0.7u-4 and up) and dpkg (1.4.0.31 and up)
have been patched appropriately.<br>
<b>NOTE: The glibc packages MUST be installed prior to installation of dpkg-1.4.0.31 or
else dpkg will fail to work due to a missing lchown() call in older glibc's.  Work
is being done currently to make glibc's support of lchown() automatically detect
and support the appropriate calls based on the current running kernel.</b>.</P>
