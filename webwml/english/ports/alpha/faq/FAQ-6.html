<H2><A NAME="ss6.1">6.1 Boards</A>
</H2>

<P> By now, there are a number of vendors that sell Alpha based
motherboards.  First, there is Digital Semiconductor which provides
reference designs and also sells so called "evaluation boards".  The
most popular boards are currently the AlphaPC 164LX and SX. The PC164
is also still available. Some resellers will offer nice deals on the PC64
(Cabriolet).
More info can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/alpha.htm">Digital Semiconductor's</A> web site.

<P> 
<A HREF="http://www.digital.de/oem/products/boards">Digital OEM</A> also offers Alpha
boards: the low-end Noname (AXPpci33) and the higher-end Alpha PCI
boards.  The Noname board was the first Alpha PCI motherboard sold by
DEC and the section below describes it in detail.  The Alpha PCI
boards are newer and also a lot more performant.  Volume shipment
started April 96. Then came the generation PC164 (with variations such
as SX, LX, RX) and now were looking forward to the 264DP.
<P>
<P> Samsung also produces boards, which are sold through it's subsidiary
<A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com">Alpha Processor, Inc.</A>
They tend to be very similar (identical?) to the Digital OEM offerings,
but API seems to be targeted more towards the NT market. Don't let that
worry you: they support Linux too.

</H2>

<P>In general, it's likely that buying a complete system will actually be
cheaper than putting one together yourself.  This is especially true
for many of the third-party systems and for Digital's XL machines.  If
you add the costs of all the components to the price of the
motherboard, you'll quickly find that it's difficult to beat those
prices.  The good news about this is of course that it will also save
you the trouble of having to find appropriate parts.
A number of third-party vendors can be found through the 
<A HREF="http://www.alphapowered.com">AlphaPowered</A> page. They typically
offer configurations based on 164LX and 164SX boards, but some may have
nice deals on the older boards as well.
<P>
<P>Linux will also run on some of Digital's server-class systems. Check the
table in the previous chapter.
