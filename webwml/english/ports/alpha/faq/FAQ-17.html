<H2><A NAME="s17">17. How To Run DEC Unix Netscape on Linux/Alpha</A></H2>

<P>(This section was contributed by 
<A HREF="mailto:gander@voyager.netcomi.com">Gerald Anderson</A>.  Note that the Linux/x86
Netscape binary can be run through 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/em86/">em86</A>.
This is a bit slower, but doesn't require any special licenses.
Now that Netscape's sourcecode is available, we expect to see a native
Linux/Alpha version in the near future. However porting to 64bit proved
more difficult than expected. A fairly stable version of Mozilla is
available for download from 
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org">the Alpalinux Homepage</A>. Or check out 
<A HREF="http://www.unix-ag.org/Linux-Alpha/Mozilla/">Nils Faerber</A>'s
page for the latest developments.)
<P>
<P> Support for running ECOFF (the OSF and DU version of <CODE>a.out</CODE>)
binaries must have been built into the Linux/Alpha kernels.  In
effect, this allows you to run with minimal difficulty a large variety
of programs that were orginally compiled on an OSF/1 or Digital Unix
Alpha.

<H2><A NAME="ss17.1">17.1 Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>There are two separate lists of requirements depending on if you
have access to OSF/1 v3.x or Digital Unix 4.x (Editor's note: Digital
renamed DEC OSF/1 to DEC Unix somewhere around release 3.2---it's the
same OS, just different releases).
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>For DEC OSF/1 up to and including v3.2:</B><DD><P>
<UL>
<LI>Linux kernel version 2.0.x or 2.1.x (you must have ECOFF
support compiled in)</LI>
<LI> Access to an Alpha running OSF/1 3.x</LI>
</UL>
<DT><B>For DEC Unix version v4.0 or newer:</B><DD><P>
<UL>
<LI> Linux kernel version 2.1.23+ (you must have ECOFF support
compiled in)</LI>
<LI> Access to an Alpha running DU 4.x</LI>
</UL>
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.2">17.2 How-To</A>
</H2>

<P>For both OSF/1 3.x and Digital Unix 4.x you must complete the
following.
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Get <CODE>/sbin/loader</CODE> from the Digital machine and place it
in <CODE>/sbin/loader</CODE> on your Linux box.
</LI>
<LI>  Create a directory on your Linux box for <CODE>/usr/shlib</CODE>
 </LI>
<LI>  Get the following libraries from the Digital box and place in the 
<CODE>/usr/shlib</CODE> directory on your Linux box
<UL>
<LI><CODE>libXm.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libXmu.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libm.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libX11.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libXt.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libdnet_stub.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libc.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libXext.so</CODE></LI>
</UL>

If you are going to use Digital Unix 4.0 libs/loader you must also get:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>libSM.so</CODE></LI>
<LI><CODE>libICE.so</CODE></LI>
</UL>

 </LI>
<LI> Get the file <CODE>/etc/svc.conf</CODE> from the Digital box and
place it in <CODE>/etc/svc.conf</CODE> on your Linux box.
 </LI>
<LI>  Download from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/">ftp.netscape.com</A> the OSF/Alpha version of navigator
(e.g., get <CODE>netscape-v301-export.alpha-dec-osf2.0.tar.gz</CODE>
from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/navigator/3.01/unix/">this</A>
directory).
 </LI>
<LI>  Install it
 </LI>
<LI>  Run it!!  </LI>
</OL>
 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.3">17.3 Conclusion</A>
</H2>

<P> This procedure has been tested on a Red Hat 4.0 and Red Hat 4.1 box
with kernel versions 2.0.27, 2.0.28 (for OSF/1 3.x) and 2.1.23 (for DU
4.x).  It seems to be very stable when running the OSF/1 libs/loader
but I've noticed some problems with Segmentation Faults using the DU
4.0 libs/loader.  I've also noticed that when using DU 4.0 libs/loader
that the <CODE>/etc/svc.conf</CODE> file is not as necessary as when
running the OSF/1 stuff.  It does complain, but it is not fatal.
<P>If you have questions regarding this document please first refer to
the archives for the axp-list mailing list/archive at 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/support/mailing-lists/">http://www.redhat.com</A>, then if you
didn't find your answer feel free to mail me at 
<A HREF="mailto:gander@voyager.netcomi.com">gander@voyager.netcomi.com</A>.

<B>NOTE:</B> Java applets do not work with any version of OSF/1 or DU
libs/loader.  I have not heard if anybody is working on this, or what
the problem is.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Following is a note received from Linus regarding support for DU 4.0
libs/loader, if you do email him, please insure as noted that the
problem is detailed and reproducible.

<H2><A NAME="ss17.4">17.4 Mail</A>
</H2>

<P>After setting Netscape up like this, sending E-Mail still fails. Oleg
Gusev came up with the following solution:
<UL>
<LI>mkdir /etc/sia/</LI>
<LI>touch /etc/sia/siainitgood</LI>
<LI>copy /etc/sia/matrix.conf from DU to Linux</LI>
</UL>

He also came up with a patch to fix the argv[0] problem mention in Linus'
quote. Check the axp-list archive at Red Hat.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss17.5">17.5 Threads</A>
</H2>

<P>When you receive errors that mention DECthreads you need to do the following:
<UL>
<LI> (re)move libpthread.so and libpthreads.so from the shared library directory</LI>
<LI> <CODE>ln -sf /usr/shlib/libc.so /usr/shlib/libpthread.so/</CODE></LI>
<LI> <CODE>ln -sf /usr/shlib/libc.so /usr/shlib/libpthreads.so/</CODE></LI>
</UL>

This problem is known to occur with recent Netscapes and with Adobe Acrobat 3.
