<P> There are currently aproximately four end-user installable Linux
distributions for the Alpha available. Two are from Red Hat and DLD.
Debian  and Stampede will be ready shortly. A distribution from SuSE
is expected to be presented at the '99 CeBIT.
More information on each of these distributions can be
found below.  The 
<A HREF="http://www.ssc.com/lj/">Linux Journal</A> periodically publishes reviews of these distributions.
Check those for a general who's who.
<P>Commercial products for Linux/Alpha also start to appear slowly.  Some
noteworthy products are listed in the next section.
<P>If you know of any other Linux/Alpha distributions or products, please
mail 
<A HREF="mailto:geerten@bart.nl">us</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1 Red Hat</A>
</H2>

<P> Red Hat is distributing the Alpha version of its well-known Linux
distribution.  Red Hat for Alpha is ELF-based and available both
on CD-ROM and via ftp.  The distribution uses the RPM system (Red Hat
Package Manager) which allows easy installation of both sources and
binaries.  Besides installing packages, it also allows to keep track
of what's installed and it can even uninstall packages that you don't
like anymore.  But Red Hat is a lot more than just RPM.  Be sure
to check their 
<A HREF="http://www.redhat.com/">web site</A> for
all the details. <BR>
<P>The Red Hat distribution is available via ftp from the Red Hat
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/">site</A>. Version 5.2 has been
available for some time now. Be sure to downoad the errata as well.
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/MIRRORS.html">Mirror sites</A>
all over the world are available as well.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2 DLD</A>
</H2>

<P> Die Deutsche Linux Distribution gibt es jetzt auch f&uuml;r Alpha. This uses
Red Hat's RPM format, and generally seems to be based on the Red Hat
distribution, but it's completely in German. Check out 
<A HREF="http://www.delix.de">www.delix.de</A><P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3 Debian GNU/Linux</A>
</H2>

<P> Debian is working on a distribution for the Alpha. It should be ready
for distribution "Real Soon Now". See the 
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/">Debian home page</A> for info on how
to subscribe to the relevant mailing list.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.4">13.4 Stampede</A>
</H2>

<P> It seems that a distribution for Alpha is also being prepared by
<A HREF="http://www.stampede.org">Stampede</A>.
<P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.5">13.5 Sources</A>
</H2>

<P> The Linux/Alpha homepage contains a list of ftp sites and mirrors
that are used by the developers to make the latest and greatest
version of various programs available.  The Linux/Alpha home page is
located 
<A HREF="http://www.alphalinux.org">here</A>.
<P>Of course, the regular Linux ftp sites such as 
<A HREF="ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux">ftp://sunsite.unc.edu:/pub/Linux</A> or 
<A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux">ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux</A> are good for Linux/Alpha, too.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss13.6">13.6 Building a Kernel</A>
</H2>

<P>If you want to build your own kernel you may want to follow 
<A HREF="http://www.bart.nl/~geerten/patches.txt">this</A>
recipe, by Harvey J. Stein. It's for 2.0.30: clean patches for 2.0.32
are available as well, and these can be used for 2.0.33 too.<BR>
A similar Howto has been compiled by Hugo van der Kooij, which can be
found at 
<A HREF="http://www.nllgg.nl/linux/Alpha/RHL5kernel.html">http://www.nllgg.nl/linux/Alpha/RHL5kernel.html</A>. This has some
specifics related to the Red Hat 5.0 distribution.
<P>Patches for more recent 2.0 kernels (up to 2.0.35) are available from
<A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/">gatekeeper</A>.
A set for 2.0.36 will appear as soon as Jay Estabrook finds the time to
create them. Some people report some success by using the 2.0.35 patches
on a 2.0.36 kernel.
<P>Recent 2.1.xxx kernels will compile on Alpha without patches.
For kernels up to 2.1.131, do not forget to comment out "SMP = 1"
in the Makefile (unless you are compiling for an SMP-system..)
In 2.1.132 SMP has been changed into a normal config option.
With the system-type selections they also include a 'generic' option,
to create a kernel that will run on any supported Alpha platform.
<P>Likewise for 2.2.0 and 2.2.1 (2.2.* is just the continuation of 2.1.*,
now declared stable.) Beware of 2.2.2. though: it needs additional
patches to compile on non-intel platforms.
