<H2><A NAME="Supported Systems"></A> <A NAME="s5">5. What Systems Does Linux/Alpha Run On?</A></H2>

<P> The number of Alpha platforms that are supported by Linux is
quickly increasing. The following is a list of workstations and
motherboards that are known to work with Linux.
If you have any corrections to the list, please send 
<A HREF="mailto:geerten@bart.nl">us</A> mail.

<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/alphaoem/alph esc.htm">The latest products</A></B> are the 164RX (next
generation RUFFIAN), and 
<A HREF="http://www.alpha-processor.com/product/alphapc264dp.asp/">264DP</A>,
a dual processor 264 based board.
        </LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.usa.samsungsemi.com/products/browse/alphaboards.html">AlphaPC 164UX</A></B> is currently the high end board. Interestingly,
this is not a Digital product. It was developed by Deskstation,
(called RUFFIAN then), and is now being sold by Samsung. It supports
speeds up to 800 MHz, and comes with on-board Ultra Wide SCSI
(Symbios Logic 53C875), and 10/100 Mb Ethernet (Digital 21143).
Like the 164SX an LX, it uses DIMMs (SDRAM) for memory, but
it has 6 slots rather then 4.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.dec.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164lx.html">AlphaPC 164LX</A></B> is Digital's best bet. It's based on the
<B>
<A HREF="http://www.dec.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164mb.html">AlphaPC 164</A></B>, but with speeds up to 600 MHz, and using
DIMMs rather than SIMMs. (i.e. SDRAM rather then DRAM.)
</LI>
<LI> The low end of the current generation is the <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc164sx.html">AlphaPC 164SX</A></B>. It uses the 21164PC variant of the
Alpha microprocessor, at 400 or 533 MHz. This board is targeted
at the NT Workstation market, but it will run Linux just fine.
</LI>
<LI> For a complete Workstation you may want to look at <B>
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/perswork.html">Miata</A> </B> (Personal Workstation). This comes with a Graphics
Card (Powerstorm) for which X11 support does not (yet) exist,
but Matrox Millennium is a popular replacement.
</LI>
<LI>  <B>
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a600.html">Alcor</A> (AS600),
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a500.html">Bret</A> (AS500)</B>.  The Alcor kernel
is supposed to work fine with the AlphaStation 500 as
well.  If you can confirm this, please let us know.
</LI>
<LI>  <B>EB164</B>.  The Aspen Timberline and Summit machines are
similar to this machine/motherboard.  The EB164 has been replaced
by the PC164 and it's successors (see above).
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/semiconductor/alpha/dsc-pc64mb.html">Cabriolet</A> (aka AlphaPC64):</B>
This is a PCI-bus based motherboards using the 21064 Alpha CPU.  
It is more pricey than the 21066 systems but it does make for a
real nice system and many third-party products are based on this
design.  This board typically runs at 275MHz but some vendors sell
an (overclocked) 300MHz version. It really is historical now, but
you may be able to find them at very attractive prices.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.com/info/alphaserver/alphasrv1000/alphasrv1000_abstract.html">Mikasa</A></B> (AlphaServer 1000).  Noritake (AlphaServer 1000a)
is supported as well, if you use kernels 2.0.30 or higher, with the
appropriate patches. However, the builtin Cirrus graphics card
is not (or very poorly) supported by X11.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a200.html">Mustang</A> (AS200),
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a250.html">M3</A> (AS250)
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a255.html">???</A> (AS255)
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/a400.html">Avanti</A> (AS400)
:</B> Linux now runs on all of these AlphaStations.
The reason for clumping all these machines together is that they are
all very similar to program.  In particular, they all can run one
and the same kernel when booted using the same firmware.  Thus,
when configuring a kernel, simply pick "Avanti" as the system type
since that covers all of the above machines.
</LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://www.workstation.digital.com/products/alphaxl.html">XL</A>
The XL machine is also know as the "Windows NT Dream Machine."
Well, for what it's worth, (most of them) are perfectly happy
running Linux.

The regular XL is based on the 21064 CPU and runs either at 233
or 266MHz with 512KB or 2MB of second level cache, respectively.

The newer XL Turbo is based on the 21164A CPU and runs either at
300 or 366MHz.  The Turbo always comes with 2MB of
second-level cache.
</LI>
<LI><B>
<A HREF="http://www.tadpole.com/products/alpha.html">ALPHAbook 1</A></B>
The ALPHAbook 1 is a 21066A based notebook (the first and only
portable Alpha, so far).  Linux works fine on this machine with
a few extra patches.  An X server is available for this machine
as well.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Alpha/systems/as1000/docs/SOC/Feb94/ch-1-b.txt">Jensen</A> (aka DEC 2000 aka DECpc AXP 150):</B>
This is the oldest of all Alpha PCs and comes with an EISA bus.
You probably don't want to buy such a machine new anymore since
you can now get faster machines for less money.  However, it is
not uncommon to get really amazing deals for these machines and
a Jensen definitively would make a nice home box.  The
firmware seems a little picky about what graphics card and SCSI
controllers
it wants, but if you're just looking for an affordable Alpha box,
it might be worthwhile to look into it.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.digital.de/orgs/OEM/products/boards/axppci33.html">Noname</A> (aka AXPpci33):</B>
This is a PCI-bus based motherboard using the 21066 Alpha CPU
(Low-Cost Alpha).  The core of the 21066 is the same as the 21064.
The only difference is that the 21066 also has a memory and I/O
controller integrated into the chip (which has the effect that the
external interface is much simpler and therefore much cheaper).
This board is available in a 166 and a 233MHz version.
</LI>
<LI> <B>
<A HREF="http://www.annex.co.uk/systems/udb.html">UDB</A>:</B>
Linux/Alpha also runs well on the Universal Desktop Box.
(That's the box that's called "Multia" when it's running Windows NT.)
The TGA graphics card and the builtin soundcard
are supported.  The UDB is basically a Noname board with more
hardware builtin and wrapped into a neat little box.  So when
configuring a kernel for it, simply select the "Noname" system
type.  The UDB currently provides the lowest-cost entry point
into the Alpha world.
</LI>
<LI> <B>EB*:</B>
Digital used to sell various other evaluation boards (e.g.,
EB66, EB64+, etc.). Reportedly, Linux/Alpha may run on some of
these.  But they were relatively pricey and should now be
considered obsolete.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1 Unsupported Systems</A>
</H2>

<P> Linux/Alpha is unlikely to support the TURBOchannel-based Alpha
systems in the near (or any) future (this is the DEC 3000 series of
workstations).  The reason for this is two-fold: first, these machines
have an I/O system that is very different from PCI-based machines and
therefore do not look anything like PCs (e.g., pretty much all drivers
would have to be written from scratch).  Second, with the advent of
PCI, the TURBOchannel is pretty much dead technology (for better or
worse) and it just isn't all that much fun to develop software for
dead technology (on the other hand, it may soon be possible to buy
such systems cheaply, which would make them more interesting to Linux
users, I suppose).
<P>If you have such a machine and want to run a free OS, look for the
*BSD's. At least one of them supports the 3000 series.

<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2 Table</A>
</H2>

<P>The table below (one of Jay Estabrooks many invaluable contributions)
may prove useful to select the right MILO/Kernel/bootfloppy for your
system.

<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

The following table may be useful; sorry, but I haven't put in the "family" designations
explicitly, but the groupings and MILOs are indicative, mostly.
