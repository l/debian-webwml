<H2><A NAME="s12">12. What Graphics Cards Work With Linux/Alpha?</A></H2>

<P> Linux/Alpha supports both DEC's TGA and generic VGA cards.  The
new PowerStorm cards from DEC are not supported yet.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.1">12.1 TGA Card</A>
</H2>

<P> TGA is DEC's (first) family of workstation graphics cards for the
PCI bus.  It makes for nice and very quick cards.  The only drawback
is that since it is coming from the workstation market, it does
<EM>not</EM> support 16-bit color mode.
<P>There are three versions of the TGA card.  They are all based on the
21030 chip:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
Model:  Description:
ZLXp-E1  8-plane TGA (256 colors)
ZLXp-E2 24-plane TGA (16 million colors)
ZLXp-E3 24-plane TGA + 32-plane Zbuffer (16 million colors and 3D support)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Caveat: as described below, only the ZLXp-E1 is currently supported by
an X server.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.2">12.2 VGA Cards</A>
</H2>

<P> Linux boots in VGA mode, so pretty much any graphics card should
do for Linux.  However, the graphics card also needs to work with the
firmware.  This is non-trivial since many PCI cards need proprietary
wakeup sequences to bring them into a VGA compatible mode.  To solve
this problem, the firmware includes an x86 emulator that is used to
execute the BIOS initialization code on the graphics card.  In theory,
it is therefore possible plug in any PC graphics card.
<P>DEC implemented an x86 emulator that is used by the MILO (Linux), SRM
(DEC Unix), and ARC (Windows NT) firmware.  This emulator is mature
and can indeed initialize most, if not all, cards.  To be on the safe
side, take a look at the hardware-compatibility lists for DEC Unix and
Windows NT before deciding on a card.
<P>MILO also comes with an (optional) emulator that is free.  It is not
nearly as mature as DEC's emulator, but it nevertheless is able to
initialize at least following graphics cards:

<H2><A NAME="ss12.3">12.3 Cards Supported by the X Windowing System</A>
</H2>

<P> According to the XFree 3.3.3.1 Release Notes:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
The following X servers are available for Alpha hardware:

          XMa64.tgz       Mach 64 server
          XMono.tgz       Mono server (generic driver only)
          XP9K.tgz        P9000 server
          XTGA.tgz        DEC 21030 (TGA) server
          XS3.tgz         S3 server
          XS3V.tgz        old S3 ViRGE server (please use SVGA server)
          XSVGA.tgz       SVGA server (Matrox Millennium and S3 ViRGE drivers only)
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The S3 server is known to work with 764x, 805, 864,
928 based cards (e.g., Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, #9 GXE64, #9
Level 12, #9 Motion 771).  The Mach64 server is known to work
with WinTurbo GX-VRAM and Graphics Xpression CX-DRAM cards.
<P>
<P> These servers are available from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/">ftp://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/</A>.
More recent developments are availabel from 
<A HREF="http://www.suse.com/">SuSE</A>. Check out the section on commercial software for other options.
<P>
<P> For TGA not just one, but two servers exist: the first one is by the
XFree project, as mentioned above. It's relatively young so it's not
well-optimized yet, but it's definitively usable and since sources are
available for it, anybody can improve it.<BR> The other one is
based on DEC-proprietary code (sources are not available). It is fast
and relatively stable and can be found 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/X11">here</A>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss12.4">12.4 Can Linux/Alpha Run Without Graphics Card?</A>
</H2>

<P> The firmware can be controlled over a serial line terminal at 9600
Baud and it is possible to boot Linux/Alpha in that manner, but Linux
itself does not currently support headless boots.  There are kernel
patches floating on the net that add this functionality, however.
