<P> These boxes have become quite popular recently because they are now
available cheaply (Digital is clearing out the warehouse ??) which makes
them the successor to the UDB as a lower end way into the Alpha 
world. 
<A HREF="http://www.onsale.com">Onsale</A> and 
<A HREF="http://www.webauction.com">Webauction</A> are the places to get them.

<P> Rick Taylor (

<DT><B>CPU</B><DD><P>The AS200 comes with 21064 or 21064A CPUs. Speeds are 166MHz and 233 MHz.
The support chipset is the 21071-AA.
<DT><B>cache</B><DD><P>Apart from the on-chip cache, there is 512K of cache on the mainboard.
<DT><B>memory</B><DD><P>There are 6 slots for 72 pin true parity SIMMs. Slots must be filled
in pairs. According to the specs, 384 megs of RAM can be added. The items 
from Onsale seem to come with 16 MB. You may want to add some before
installing Linux.
<DT><B>disc</B><DD><P>The base configuration does not include any discs...
<DT><B>video</B><DD><P>.. nor a graphics card. Any Alpha supported PCI video card should work:
S3Virge DX (4MB) and S3Trio64V2 (2MB) definitely do.

<P>Some more quotes from Rich's mail:

<UL>
<LI>"As with most of these older Alphas, upgrading the firmware is all but a
necessity to install Linux.  Mine came with an older SRM that just wouldn't
load the Linux kernel without locking, and upgrading to the latest ARC fixed
the problem.  Mine came from the batch of Alphas that onsale and webauction
have been (and still are, in the case of webauction) selling, so I'd assume
other new AS200 owners might have similar problems."

<LI>"To get the builtin sound card to work you need to recompile the kernel on
Redhat.  Fairly simple, but I just talked a guy through it on the redhat-AXP
list, so I thought I'd mention it. :)"
</LI>
<LI>"Something that surprised me when I first installed (before I hooked the
machine into the local ethernet network and while I was using PPP): my modem
wouldn't work on the first com port.  I suspect that had something to do with
the serial console setting.  The symptom was the modem constantly getting
traffic when no program should have been talking to it.  Not too tough to
figure out, but it could be rather confusing to someone who didn't get the
documentation with their machine.  A quick fix is to simply use the other com
port for the modem."
</LI>
<LI>"My AS200 came with something of an oddity - an ISA card with two PCMCIA slots
on it.  According to the DEC shipping label it was an option, but as I don't
have any PCMCIA devices, I removed the card from the machine and put it in
storage.  I'm not sure if/how the card works in Linux, and I didn't get any
documentation for the card, so I don't have much information on it."</LI>

<P> If you have bought one of them you may find the following URL's
useful: both give a step by step recipe to get Linux installed.<BR>
