<P> This section provides some more information on the Noname motherboard.
There are some hints and tips that you might be interested in if you're
considering putting together a system on your own.
<P>First off, here is what the Noname board looks like: 
<A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/axppci/small_pci33.gif">picture of Noname board</A>.
<P>This section also includes standard benchmark performance results,
which might help give you an idea of how a Noname system performs.
<P>Before going out and purchasing such a machine, please be aware that
the Noname really is a low-end machine and as such is relatively low
performance. The Noname <EM>can</EM> make for a nice machine (especially
together with a TGA graphics card), but be sure to run the
applications you care about before making a purchase decision.  Rather
then putting together a system based on this board, it is currently
much cheaper to get a Universal Desktop Box (
<A HREF="http://www.annex.co.uk/systems/udb.html">UDB</A>).  That box is basically a
Noname with lots of very nice builtin hardware. The last UDB's are now
being sold at $ 99,-.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.1">8.1 What Firmware Does Linux/Alpha Require?</A>
</H2>

<P> You will need the OSF/1 PALcode to run Linux.  Digital has made
the firmware available for ftp so you can download the SRM console
from 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/axppci">Digital's ftp site</A>. There are two serious
drawbacks with the SRM console: it eats away 2-3MB of RAM and it
<B>cannot</B> boot from IDE drives.  Fortunately, the free 
<A HREF="milo.html">MILO</A> replacement firmware doesn't suffer from
these problems.  Plus with MILO, you get all the sources!

<H2><A NAME="ss8.2">8.2 What Do I Need To Watch Out For?</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <B> Keyboard </B>

<P>If you plan on running DEC Unix (formerly known as OSF/1), you have
to get a board with a PS/2 style connector.  On the other hand, it
seems a lot easier/cheaper to find cases and keyboards for AT-style
connectors.  (Nekotech seems to be shipping Noname motherboards with
the PS/2 connectors on a slot-bracket which allows you to have the
best of both worlds: a regular (cheap) AT-case without having to tie
up a serial port for the mouse.)
<P>The only difference between the PS/2 and AT-style keyboard
interface is the keyboard <B>connector</B>. The electrical interface
is identical.  In fact, you can buy AT to PS/2 converters in any
computer shop for a few bucks.  The advantage of PS/2-style board is
that there is a second connector that can be used for a PS/2 mouse
(i.e., no need to tie up a serial port with a serial mouse).  But then
again: economy of scale currently works in the direction that serial
mice are dirt cheap and omni-present, which can't be said about PS/2
mice.
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Memory</B>

<P> Be careful about what kind of SIMMs you get.  In particular,
"logical parity" SIMMs <B>do not</B> work.  What you should get is
70ns memory with 36bits/SIMM.  These are also known as ECC SIMMs.
Please refer to the OEM Design Guide for details.
<P>Also notice that some of the firmware simply <EM>refuses</EM> to boot with
anything less than 16MB of RAM installed.  Older versions of the SRM
console used to do that and the ARC console apparently has the same
bad habit.  MILO and any reasonably recent release of the SRM console
should boot fine in 8MB, however.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.3">8.3 Will Normal ISA Cards Work?</A>
</H2>

<P> They should and, as far as we can tell, they really do work.
Besides the drivers for the on-board interfaces, several other ISA
cards are known to work already (e.g., depca and ne2000 Ethernet
cards, sound cards, internal modems, etc.).  Notice that the SRM
console includes a configuration command called "isacfg" that allows
to setup the PCI/ISA bridge.  That command has an undocumented option
<CODE>enadev</CODE> that allows to enable the ISA card.

<H2><A NAME="ss8.4">8.4 What's Performance Like?</A>
</H2>

<P> Notice that the numbers below are for DEC Unix.  Linux/Alpha is
likely to be less tuned at this point, but it gives you an idea of
where the hardware stands.
