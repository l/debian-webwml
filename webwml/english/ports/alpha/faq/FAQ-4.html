<H2><A NAME="s4">4. How fast is the Alpha ?</A></H2>

<P> This depends on the type of system you have, and what you are trying to do.
<P>
<P> The Alpha is a RISC processor: it has fewer and simpler instructions. Thus,
at the same clockspeed, it will generally be slower than a CISC processor. But,
being simpler, it will be easier to build processors that run at higher speeds.
The fastest Alpha (now at 700MHz) will outpace the fastest Intel processor
(450 MHz.) This will remain true for many years to come. (It will also be
more expensive.)
<P>
<P> In BogoMIPS, Alpha's up to the 164 show a speed approximately equal to the
clock frequency in MHz (like Intel's 486 and early Pentium processors.) The
264 has a BM value of twice the clock speed (like Pentium MMX and higher.)<BR>
 This, however can not be taken as a true indication of the speed for
real applications.
<P>
<P> RISC instructions are fewer and simpler, so you need to execute more of
them to get the same amount of work done. On top of that, they are also larger.
So, to keep your Alpha running at full speed, you need large caches and high
memory bandwith. Most Alpha's have two levels of cache on chip, and the newer
boards also provide wide (128 or 256 bit) memory busses. Some of the older
Alpha systems, however, do suffer from lack of memory bandwith.
<P>
<P> The Alpha has earned itself a reputation for floating point performance.
However, it takes a very good compiler and libraries to achieve the optimum.
Until recently, this meant that the real numbercrunchers would often revert 
to Digital Unix. Recently, though the compilers in the Open Source arena 
still lag behind, large improvements have been made w.r.t. the libraries.
