<H2><A NAME="ss11.2">11.2 Introduction</A>
</H2>

<P> For some people, the Ruffian is the absolute business. Compared to the LX, it has more memory
capacity, more PCI slots, onboard SCSI and ethernet and takes higher-clocked processors. Yet it 
is plagued with a bad reputation.
<P>
<H3>The Caveat</H3>

<P> While the vast majority have no trouble with their Ruffians (author included), a handful of
users find fundamental shortcomings that make the board unusable for their applications. 
<P>
<H3>The Symptoms</H3>

<P> A virtual memory stress-test that induces continuous heavy paging can cause the machine to die. 
The problem manifests itself through various "Unable to handle kernel paging request", "killing 
the swapper", "attempting to swap the idle process" messages, and a register dump. The system 
may become unusable after that. 
<P>
<P> The stress-test may run without failure (I have run it for three days without fault), 
or it may fail within two seconds. I have seen both
behaviours on the same machine, in different configurations. 
<P>
<P> Some people claim this problem only arises with large memory configurations. 
<P>
<H3>The Cause</H3>

<P> Empirical evidence (above) suggests heavy paging causes this situation. However, some
people have seen their Ruffians fail within seconds. I can induce rapid failure by 
reordering the DIMM pairs in my machine. However, on putting them back in the original order,
the problem remains for a while! Could there be some non-volatile state that is being confused? 
<P>
<H3>The Fix</H3>

<P> There are several suggested fixes: 
<UL>
<LI>     Use the latest milo and ldmilo available on gatekeeper (see below). </LI>
<LI>     The patched 2.0.35 kernel sources on that site are also worth installing. </LI>
<LI>     Another empirical fix is to set the memory available to Linux to be a small
amount less than the total memory. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Hopefully a definite fix beyond these heuristic measures will be found soon, and 
several people are involved with the problem (in spare time...) 
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ss11.3">11.3 The Red Hat Release CDs and the Ruffian </A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, both Red Hat 5.1 and 5.2 releases have flaws to be aware of when installing on a Ruffian.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.4">11.4 Red Hat 5.1 </A>
</H2>

<P>For your first disk, you should use a different milo and ldmilo.exe file, which are 
downloadable from Gatekeeper, Digital's FTP server:
<P>

<A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/milo-ruffian-981020">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels/milo-ruffian-981020</A></LI>

</UL>
<P>
<H3>How to build your milo disk</H3>

<P>
<OL>
<LI>   Take a DOS-formatted floppy </LI>
<LI>   Copy the two files above onto it, renaming them to 'ldmilo.exe' and 'milo' </LI>
<LI>   Thats it, you're done :-) </LI>
</OL>
<P>
<H3>Running XFree with Red Hat 5.1 </H3>

<P>If the XFree X server fails to start on your system, try adding the following link:
<P>
<P><CODE>cd /etc; ln -s EB164 alpha_systype</CODE>
<P>
<P>If your graphics card uses the SVGA X-server (eg, if you have a Matrox graphics card), 
you should also pick up the patched SVGA server. ( 
<A HREF="ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/pub/XFree86/">ftp://mea.tmt.tele.fi/pub/XFree86/</A> ) 
<P>
<H3>Reading the time and date correctly with Red Hat 5.1 </H3>

<P>The Ruffian ARCSBIOS uses a different format for time and date. In releases of Red Hat 
up to 5.1, this meant that Linux would not report the correct date and time. 
<P>
<P>This can be fixed using: 
<UL>
<LI>     An updated version of the clock binary (try gatekeeper), </LI>
<LI>     by getting your date and time from another system on the network using rdate -s, </LI>
<LI>     or by using xntpd. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>Date and time issues are fixed for the Ruffian in Red Hat 5.2 
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss11.5">11.5 Red Hat 5.2 </A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately the Ruffian kernel provided on the Red Hat 5.2 CD doesn't contain 
support for the Symbios 875 on-board SCSI. However, you can take the kernel image 
from Red Hat 5.1 to perform the install. Once installed, you can build your own kernel 
- the sources on 
<A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/DEC/Linux-Alpha/Kernels</A> 
for 2.0.35 are tried and trusted.

<H2><A NAME="ss11.6">11.6 Hardware Issues with the Ruffian </A>
</H2>

<H3>Ruffian On-board Ethernet </H3>

<P>The Ruffian's on-board DEC Tulip Ethernet is not very good at auto-sensing a 100Mbit 
link with the Linux Tulip driver. However, one of the recent versions (0.89H) seems to 
work for most cases. Other people have reported problems with version 0.90.
<P>
<P>The tulip device driver page is well documented at:
<UL>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://maximus.bmen.tulane.edu/~siekas/tulip.html">http://maximus.bmen.tulane.edu/~siekas/tulip.html</A> </LI>
<LI> 
<A HREF="http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html">http://cesdis.gsfc.nasa.gov/linux/drivers/tulip.html</A> </LI>
</UL>
<P>
<P>These pages also contain instructions on how to install the driver. Alternatively, 
try looking at the section on building your own kernel in this FAQ. (The location 
of the tulip device driver in the linux source tree is drivers/net/tulip.c, copy 
your newly-downloaded version in here and you're ready to build)
<P>
<P>If your ethernet doesn't autosense 100Mbit, there are some other options I have 
found to sometimes work, although we're in experimental territory here and what may 
work for me may not work for you.
<P>
<P>Your first option is to hard-code your ethernet interface to be 100baseTX, 
bypassing the autosensing mechanism. However, this doesn't always work. What 
does sometimes work is hard-coding the medium to be 10Mbit, and then 100Mbit. 
The first packet will fail transmission, but after that the link is brought up 
in 100Mbit mode. To bypass the auto-sensing mechanism, edit tulip.c and put 
numbers into the options array, according to your media type as defined in 
an array further down the code (10baseT is 12, 100baseT is 4). If you still 
can't get this to work, try this patched version of the tulip driver, actually 
patched for the Miata by Loic Prylli. What it does is to keep trying with 
user-specified hard-coded media.
<P>
<P>Again, your experience may vary...
<P>
<H3>Video Cards </H3>

<P>To boot Linux on the Ruffian, you must put the video card in the 64-bit slot. 
This is the only slot on PCI bus 0. All other slots are behind a PCI-PCI bridge 
that Milo doesn't fully support.
