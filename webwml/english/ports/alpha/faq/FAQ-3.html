<H2><A NAME="s3">3. What's The Minimum Configuration To Run Linux/Alpha?</A></H2>

<P> Linux/Alpha is known to run on machines with as little as 8MB of
RAM and a 170MB harddisk.  In those 8MB of RAM, you can run
Emacs-19.28 without swapping, but that's about it.  A system with 16MB
RAM and 500MB is perfectly reasonable to work with, even when using
X11. 32MB RAM and on the order of 1GB of disk should satisfy even
power-hungry users, though, as usually is the case: the more the
better.
<P>
<P> (Well, I guess one's perception of what is reasonable can change with
time, and with DRAM prices. I know that by now many people would consider
32MB the bare minimum, 64MB usable. Recent releases of RedHat seem to need
at least 24MB just to install...<BR>
And you'll have a hard time looking for a hard disk smaller than 2GB.)
<P>
<P> Note that, though many Alpha mainboards support EIDE, performance is 
reported to be unsatisfactory. SCSI is recommended.
