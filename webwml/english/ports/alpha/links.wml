<h2>Debian Stuff</h2>

<ul>

<li><A HREF="http://lhpca.univ-lyon1.fr/axp/debian.html">Installation Disk Page</A><br>
Maintained by Loic Prylli (our resident boot disk genius), this site contains
the most recent installation disk sets along with news and info about the
base disk package as it relates to the Alpha.  Start here if you're installing
Debian onto an Alpha</li>

<li><A HREF="http://www.bard.org.il/~marc/html/linux.phtml">Marc's Debian Page</A></br>
Marc Volovic's page, which contains the latest installation documentation
available.  This is the next stop after Loic's site if you're going to
install Debian on your Alpha.  If Marc doesn't have instructions on how
to install Debian on your particular machine (UX, SX, whatever), please
document the installation for us and mail it to the debian-alpha list for
inclusion in the official documentation.</li>

</ul>

<h2>General Alpha-Related Links</h2>

<ul>

<li><A HREF="http://www.unix-ag.org/Linux-Alpha/">Linux-Alpha Archive</a><br>
Maintained by Nils Faerber, this site includes numerous links and lots of
very valuable information for users wanting to run Linux on their Alphas.
This site is a must-see!

<li><A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/alpha-sys.html">
Intro to Alpha Systems</A><br>
A rather informative document for the new or experienced user.  It describes
the differences between Alphas and other architectures as well as describing
the different systems.  <b>If you really need to know what your system is
despite what it says on the case, see
<A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/alpha-sys-7.html">this subsection</A>.</b></li>

<li><A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/FAQ.html">Linux/Alpha FAQ</A><br>
A good source of information, the Linux/Alpha FAQ was put together by RedHat
users, but is still a great reference.</li>

<li><A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/axplinux/milo.html">MILO HOWTO</A><br>
The official HOWTO for MILO.  I'm trying to get one for aboot right now.
Once I get ahold of it, I will include it here...</li>

<li><A HREF="http://www.azstarnet.com/~axplinux/">Linux/Alpha Home Page</A><br>
(RedHat oriented, but has other good information also including the above
two documents).</li>

<li><A HREF="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/literature/dsc-library.html">Digital's Documentation Library</A>

</ul>
