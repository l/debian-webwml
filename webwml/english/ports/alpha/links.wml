<li><A HREF="http://master.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/">Paul Slootman's
Debian-Alpha Diff Page</A><br>
Maintained by Debian developer and Alpha porter Paul Slootman, this page
contains lists comparing the binary debs in the unstable tree for Alpha
and i386.  These lists basically tell Debian developers which packages
need updating/recompiling to match the current i386 tree.  If anyone is
interested in joining the package compilation effort for Alpha, this is a
great place to start, especially since it also contains instructions on
how to get the diff reports via an e-mail list that Paul set up.</li>

<li><A HREF="http://www.complete.org/~buildd">Autobuilder Status Page
</A><br>
Running on John Goerzen's EV6, the autobuilder handles most of the
packages that are currently in the Alpha tree in potato.  If you want
to see what wasn't built or what packages need help, this is the best
place to start.  It not only has very complete logs, but it's searchable
and an indispensible tool for those of us who port alot of packages to
Alpha.</li>
