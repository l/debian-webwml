<ul>

<li><A HREF="http://auric.debian.org/~paul/alpha/diff/">Paul Slootman's
Debian-Alpha Diff Page</A><br>
Maintained by Debian developer and Alpha porter Paul Slootman, this page
contains lists comparing the binary debs in the unstable tree for Alpha
and i386.  These lists basically tell Debian developers which packages
need updating/recompiling to match the current i386 tree.  If anyone is
interested in joining the package compilation effort for Alpha, this is a
great place to start, especially since it also contains instructions on
how to get the diff reports via an e-mail list that Paul set up.</li>
