<h1>Alpha Links</h1>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/">AlphaLinux.org</a><br />
This page pretty much contains everything you may want or need to know
about running Linux on Alphas.  Includes numerous links and an excellent
news section.  This site is also the home of the official
<a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/">FAQs and HOWTOs</a> related to Linux on Alphas.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/alpha-howto.html">\
Intro to Alpha Systems</a><br />
A rather old, but still informative document for the new or experienced user.
It describes
the differences between Alphas and other architectures as well as describing
the different systems.  <b>If you have an old system and you really need to 
know what your system is
despite what it says on the case, see
<a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/docs/alpha-howto.html#The%20Systems">this subsection</a>.</b></li>

<li><a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/FAQ.html">Linux/Alpha FAQ</a><br />
A good source of information, the Linux/Alpha FAQ was originally put
together by Red Hat users, but has expanded to include more general info
and is still a great reference.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/SRM-HOWTO/index.html">SRM Firmware HOWTO</a><br />
The official HOWTO for systems using SRM firmware.  If you need to use 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/aboot">aboot</a>
to boot your Alpha, this is the page for you. 
#This HOWTO is included in
#the latest version of the
#<a href="http://packages.qa.debian.org/a/aboot.html">Debian packet</a>
#as well.
</li>

<li><a href="http://alphalinux.org/faq/MILO-HOWTO/t1.html">MILO HOWTO</a><br />
The official HOWTO for MILO. Please note that 
<a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-installer/">debian-installer</a> lacks MILO support.
SRM is highly recommended, but if you cannot switch
and you are interested
in MILO support for post-Woody releases of Debian, then read 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha/2004/debian-alpha-200402/msg00003.html">this post to debian-alpha</a> and subscribe to 
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a> to add MILO support. The latest known locations
are 
<a href="http://www.suse.de/~stepan/">Stepan Rainauers page</a>, <a href="ftp://genie.ucd.ie/pub/alpha/milo/">Nikita Schmidt</a> 
and the
work done by <a href="http://dev.gentoo.org/~taviso/milo/">Gentoo</a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.alphalinux.org/faq/alphabios-howto.html">AlphaBIOS Firmware HOWTO</a><br />
The official HOWTO for systems using AlphaBIOS firmware.</li>

<li><a href="http://ftp.digital.com/pub/Digital/info/semiconductor/literature/dsc-library.html">Digital's Old Documentation Library</a> <!-- with a <a href="ftp://ftp.unix-ag.org/user/nils/Alpha-Docs/">Mirror by Nils Faerber</a> --> </li>

<!-- <li><a href="http://www.alphanews.net/">alphanews.net</a><br />
Some alpha related news are posted here, for several OS which run or used
to run on alphas.</li> -->

<li><a href="http://www.helgefjell.de/browser.php">Browsers running on Linux Alpha</a><br />
If you have troubles with your browser in an 64bit environment (should not be the case anymore, nowadays) or
if you just want to try out a new one, here you find a list of known-to work (and not to work) browsers.</li>

<li><a href="http://alphacore.info/wiki/">AlphaCore WikiPage</a><br />
This Wiki, currently mainly focused on AlphaCore (Fedora Core on Alpha) also
intends to collect general useful alpha related information.</li>
