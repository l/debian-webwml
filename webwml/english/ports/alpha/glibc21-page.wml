<h1>Glibc 2.1 on Alpha</h1>

<p>Now that the work on slink has concluded, it's time to move along
to the new glibc 2.1.  Developers based on Alphas must be aware of
some issues before getting involved with glibc 2.1:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Glibc 2.1 binaries are NOT backwardly compatible with glibc 2.0</b><br>
That's right...if you compile something on a glibc 2.1 system, you CANNOT
run that binary on a glibc 2.0 system.  This is due to many changes in the
internal structure of glibc 2.1 from 2.0 along with some other interface
changes.  More to come as I find the related info in the docs.</li>

<li><b>Library packages must be recompiled before use on glibc 2.1 systems</b><br>
This is related to the above.  In addition, some soname changes occurred with
respect to libstdc++, so all C++ software should be recompiled on glibc 2.1
systems</li>

<li><b>New egcs is required</b><br>
To accomodate the above, a new egcs is on the way to address many of the
above issues more easily.  Obviously, with a new version of egcs, it is
often best to recompile your packages with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>As I have said, I will provide further information as I come across it
in the glibc 2.1 documentation (which is sparse at the time of this writing).
