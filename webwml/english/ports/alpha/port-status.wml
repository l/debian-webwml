<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on Alpha &ndash; Status</h1>

<h2>The unstable distribution ("sid")</h2>

<p>Alpha port is continued to be developed. The automatic package 
<a href="http://buildd.debian.org/">build daemons</a> for alpha are
operational.</p>

<h2>The testing distribution ("etch")</h2>

<p>This will be the next Debian release. The port is currently <a
   href="http://wiki.debian.org/alphaEtchReleaseRecertification">requalifying</a>
   for inclusion.
</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 "sarge"</h2>

<p>This is the latest Debian release which includes the Alpha port but only
   those machines which can use SRM/aboot to boot can be installed with the
   new installer.</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 "woody"</h2>

<p>This is the old stable release which had solid support for alpha.</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "potato"</h2>

<p>Potato has much more software available and supports
more types of Alphas than slink did.</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 "slink"</h2>

<p>The alpha port was initially released with this release.</p>

<h1>Hardware support</h1>

<p>Quite a lot of hardware is now supported on Linux/Alpha. Unfortunately,
   the exact combination of machine, hardware and kernel version is
   non-trivial, so if you don't find your combo in 
   <a href="http://alphalinux.org/ALOHcl/">this list on alphalinux.org</a>,
   and researching the
   <a href="links#lists">list archives for Debian and Red Hat</a>-AXP-Lists
   neither yields a result, then 
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha/">subscribe</a> to the
   Debian-Alpha list and ask.
   Usually someone has tried already and can provide useful
   information.</p>
