<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on Alpha &ndash; Status</h1>

<h2>The unstable distribution (<q>sid</q>)</h2>

<p>Alpha port is continued to be developed. The automatic package 
<a href="http://buildd.debian.org/">build daemons</a> for Alpha are
operational.</p>

<h2>The testing distribution (<q>lenny</q>)</h2>

<p>This will be the next Debian release. The port is currently <a
   href="http://wiki.debian.org/alphaLennyReleaseRecertification">\
   requalifying</a> for inclusion. Please note that inclusion is not
   guaranteed!
</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 <q>etch</q></h2>

<p>This is the latest Debian release which includes the Alpha port but only
   those machines which can use SRM/aboot to boot can be installed with the
   new installer.</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 <q>sarge</q></h2>

<p>This release had full support for Alpha.</p>	

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 <q>woody</q></h2>

<p>This release had solid support for Alpha and is the last one to support
   machines soly using milo (i.e. not SRM).</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 <q>potato</q></h2>

<p>Potato has much more software available and supports
more types of Alphas than slink did.</p>

<h2>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 <q>slink</q></h2>

<p>The Alpha port was initially released with this release.</p>

<h1>Hardware support</h1>

<p>Quite a lot of hardware is now supported on Linux/Alpha. Unfortunately,
   the exact combination of machine, hardware and kernel version is
   non-trivial, so if you don't find your combo in 
   <a href="http://alphalinux.org/ALOHcl/">this list on alphalinux.org</a>,
   and researching the
   <a href="links#lists">list archives for Debian and Red Hat</a>-AXP-Lists
   neither yields a result, then 
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-alpha/">subscribe</a> to the
   Debian-Alpha list and ask.
   Usually someone has tried already and can provide useful
   information.</p>
