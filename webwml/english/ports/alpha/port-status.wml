<h1>Debian/GNU Linux on Alpha -- Status</h1>

<h2>"Potato"</h2>

<p>Potato is now officially released, as of 15 August 2000.
Since potato
was worked on for so long, upgrading to it is actually a good idea (at
least for Alpha users).  Potato has much more software available and supports
more types of Alphas than slink did.</p>

</ul>

<h2>"Woody"</h2>

<p>Woody (currently aka "testing") is now in deep-freeze for a forthcoming
release.  While I don't have an exact date of release yet, it should be VERY
soon.
</p>

<h2>"Sid"</h2>

<p>Sid (currently aka "unstable") is now in active development.  Current
known goals include gcc 3.1.x, XFree86 v4.2.x, and many other major improvements
over woody.  At this point, no potential release date has been determined.</p>

<p>Check back here for further status reports as they become available.</p>
