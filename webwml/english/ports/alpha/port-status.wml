<center><h1>Debian/GNU Linux on Alpha Status</h1></center>

<h2>"Potato"</h2>

<p>Potato is now officially released, as of 15 August 2000.
Since potato
was worked on for so long, upgrading to it is actually a good idea (at
least for Alpha users).  Potato has much more software available and supports
more types of Alphas than slink did.</p>

<h2>"Woody"</h2>

<p>Woody (currently aka "unstable") is now under active development.
Woody should be glibc 2.2-based and will probably include the 2.4.x
kernel (when finished).  I'll update this section as more of woody's
goals are posted.
</p>

<p>Check back here for further status reports as they become available.</p>
