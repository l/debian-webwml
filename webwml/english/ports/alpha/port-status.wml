<center><h1>Debian/GNU Linux on Alpha Status</h1></center>

<h2>"Slink"</h2>

<p>Slink was officially released early in March 1999 complete with an
Alpha port of the distribution.  Get it while it's hot!</p>

<h2>"Potato"</h2>

<p>Potato (currently aka "unstable") is now under active development.
One of the slated goals for potato is that it be a glibc 2.1-based
distribution.  Because of this, there are some inherent problems that
may arise during development (for some of them, see the
<A HREF="glibc21-page">Glibc 2.1 on Alpha Info Page</A>).  So, unless
you're actively developing for potato, it is <b>NOT</b> recommended
that users upgrade to potato prior to its release.</p>

<p>I'm currently working with the glibc maintainers to provide debs for
glibc 2.1.  Along with those, we're providing new versions of quite a few
packages (bash, ncurses, a few others, and most notably, egcs).  It is
necessary that any developer doing work on the potato distribution install
ALL of these new packages once they become available.  Joel Klecker will
handle the widespread announcement of glibc 2.1 availability once we can
get all of the archs' packages together in one upload.</p>

<p>Check back here for further status reports as they become available.</p>
