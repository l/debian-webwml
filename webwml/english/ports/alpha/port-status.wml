<center><h1>Debian/GNU Linux on Alpha Status</h1></center>

<h2>"Slink"</h2>

<p>Slink was officially released early in March 1999 complete with an
Alpha port of the distribution.  Get it while it's hot!</p>

<hr>

<h2>"Potato"</h2>

<p>Potato (currently aka "frozen") is now frozen and in the final testing
process.
One of the slated goals for potato is that it be a glibc 2.1-based
distribution.  Because of this, there are some inherent problems that
may arise during development (for some of them, see the
<A HREF="glibc21-page">Glibc 2.1 on Alpha Info Page</A>).  Since potato
has been worked on for so long, upgrading to it is actually a good idea (at
least for Alpha users).  Potato has much more software available and supports
more types of Alphas than slink did.</p>

<h2>"Woody"</h2>

<p>Woody (currently aka "unstable") is now under active development.
Woody should be glibc 2.2-based and will probably include the 2.4.x
kernel (when finished).  I'll update this section as more of woody's
goals are posted.
