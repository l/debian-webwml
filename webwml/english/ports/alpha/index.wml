<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on Alpha Systems</h1>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to the Alpha family of processors. The Alpha family excels in
floating point operations, hence its large deployment in the scientific
computing and mathematical research fields.</p>

<p><a href="sys_types">Most types of Alphas</a> are supported by the Debian
Alpha port; the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/alpha/">installation
manual</a> describes how to install and the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/alpha/release-notes/">release notes</a>
describe how to upgrade a Debian Alpha system.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Alpha processor development ceased
in 2004, with the proper support from the Linux community,
the Alpha port will never disappear. Here's the
<a href="port-status">current port status</a>. Alpha users might also be
interested in <a href="links">these useful resources</a>.</p>

<P>If you'd like to join us in this project, please peruse this page
and <a href="links#lists">join the mailing list</a>.
Things can be fast-moving and we all
realise that not everyone has the technical expertise to do it all,
but any help that people can or want to offer would be gladly
accepted.</p>

<p><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!<br />
