<h1>Debian GNU/Linux on Alpha Systems</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's (now Compaq's) Alpha family of processors.
The Alpha family excels in floating point operations, hence its large
install-base in the scientific computing and mathematical research fields.
Unfortunately, with the roadmap looking bleak for Alpha after the HP-Compaq
merger, we are likely to see the last new Alpha generation by 2004.
This is the Linux community, though, and with the proper community support,
the Alpha port will never disappear.</p>

<P>If you'd like to join us in this project, please peruse this page
and join the mailing list. Things can be fast-moving and we all
realise that not everyone has the technical expertise to do it all,
but any help that people can or want to offer would be gladly
accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!<br>
Chris Chimelis</i></p>
