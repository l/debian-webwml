<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's (now Compaq's) Alpha family of processors. Even though
the Alpha family boasts incredible speed all around, it particularly
excels in floating point operations. Thus, it's becoming the platform
of choice for scientific computing and mathematical research.  And,
with Compaq's stated commitment to supporting and continuing the Alpha
processor line, we are guaranteed to enjoy this raw computing
power for years to come.</p>

<P>The Alpha port of Linux is rapidly becoming the OS of choice for
most Alpha owners. It is not only "familiar" to Linux-Intel users, it
is also 64-bit clean and very fast on these advanced processors. While
many still dual-boot over to Digital Unix, most only do so to compile
mathematical software that they wish to run on Linux (Linux-Alpha will
run DU binaries with the proper libraries installed and kernel
support).</p>

<P>Awhile ago, the powers that be in the Debian project decided
to branch out and try to port the distribution to as many platforms as
Linux would run on. Since that decision, those of us who prefer Debian
and wanted to help have jumped in and worked hard on porting hundreds
of packages over to the Alpha.  If you'd like to join us in this
project, please peruse this page and join the mailing list. Things
can be fast-moving and we all realise that not everyone has the
technical expertise to do it all, but any help that people can or want
to offer would be gladly accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!<br>
