<h1>Debian-Alpha</h1>

<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>26 January 1999</b></p>
<p>Kernel version 2.2.0 released!<br>
FINALLY, after a very long release schedule, version 2.2.0 of the Linux
has been released and cleared by Linus.  In addition to the numerous
new device drivers, it offers many Alpha benefits including:
<ul>
<li>"Generic" Alpha support which allows for one kernel with modules to
boot numerous types of Alphas</li>
<li>Better overall support for the Alpha platform in that it does not
require downstream patching</li>
<li>TGA frame buffer support, which helps those of us with UDBs or 
others with TGAs in their systems</li>
</ul>
I can go on and on about this kernel since I've been running 2.1 kernels
almost exclusively for the past year or so, but I won't drone on and on.
I will say this, however, this is a BRAND NEW kernel, so bugs are bound
to crop up.  Keep this in mind before switching from your current
kernel to 2.2.0.  As many have said, Your Mileage May Vary....
</p>

<P><B><CENTER>For the latest status on the port, check the
<A HREF="release-checklist">Release Checklist</A>
page for more details.</CENTER></B></p>

<p>A quick thanks to everyone involved thusfar.  You've done a fabulous
job and we wouldn't be this far without everyone's help</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's Alpha family of processors. Even though the Alpha family
boasts incredible speed all around, it particularly excels in floating
point operations. Thus, it's becoming the platform of choice for
scientific computing and mathematical research.</p>

<P>The Alpha port of Linux is rapidly becoming the OS of choice for
most Alpha owners. It is not only "familiar" to Linux-Intel users, it
is also 64-bit clean and very fast on these advanced processors. While
many still dual-boot over to Digital Unix, many only do so to compile
mathematical software that they wish to run on Linux (Linux-Alpha will
run DU binaries with the proper libraries installed and kernel
support).</p>

<P>Not too long ago, the powers that be in the Debian project decided
to branch out and try to port the distribution to as many platforms as
Linux would run on. Since that decision, those of us who prefer Debian
and wanted to help have jumped in and worked hard on porting hundreds
of packages over to the Alpha.  If you'd like to join us in this
project, please peruse this page and join the mailing list. Things
can be fast-moving and we all realise that not everyone has the
technical expertise to do it all, but any help that people can or want
to offer would be gladly accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!</i></p>

<h2><b>Who are we?</b></h2>

<P>Since there's no clearly defined "team" here, it's hard to say who's
in on this and who's just visiting from time to time.  In the end, we're
all working towards the same end.  Here's the people that are most often
seen on the debian-alpha list:</P>

<ul>

<li><A HREF="mailto:chris@classnet.med.miami.edu">Chris Chimelis</A><br>
(me)...better known as "The Human Package-Compiling Machine" :-)  For the
most part, I compile packages....LOTS of packages...and generally try to
address software porting issues.  I also handle most problems with our
egcs and maintain binutils and libffm, so if you have a question or problem with
any of those, let me know.</li>

<li>Paul Slootman<br>
Paul is another person who's compiling tons of packages.  He's also really
good at porting those "rip-your-hair-out" packages that we all seem to need
but nobody wants to port.</li>

<li>Bart Warmerdam<br>
The latest addition to our ad-hoc package compilation team.  Bart has
successfully ported a bunch of previously untouched packages.  Hats
off to Bart, keep up the good work!</li>

<li>Loic Prylli<br>
Has put together some really great installation disk sets.  I'm looking
forward to the next set which should be even better than before.</li>

<li>Mikolaj J. Habryn<br>
Fixed a VERY serious problem recently in glibc and the kernel that was
exposed by dpkg.  I can't WAIT to get this patch included (it will be
already applied by release).</li>

</ul>
