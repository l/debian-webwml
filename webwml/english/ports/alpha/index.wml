<p>Slink Released - Debian 2.1 for Alpha Ships With It!</br>
That's right, slink has been released officially as Debian 2.1.
The release now includes the Alpha port, so bang on it, abuse it,
break it, and then let us know what failed :-)  Seriously, though,
I personally feel that the work that we have accomplished is first-rate
and definitely release-worthy.  If anything doesn't work, please
post to the debian-alpha mailing list and also post a bug report
detailing your problems so we can improve the quality of the packages
that we ship out.</p>

<p>Glibc 2.1 is almost here!<br>
The maintainer of glibc 2.1 and I have been working together to
resolve the few remaining major issues for glibc 2.1.  I'm currently
expecting a new egcs package from him and, once I get that compiled,
a set of glibc 2.1 debs will hit master.  Joel will make the official
announcement for the upload, fyi.<br>
I have made an announcement to the debian-alpha list, though, basically
asking for a voluntary suspension of Alpha uploads to master for potato
until all of the glibc 2.1 debs are installed.  This will prevent having
to recompile a bunch of things which may need some modifications anyway.
Basically, I just wanted to save everyone some extra work that would
just be replaced anyway :-)

<P><B><CENTER>Now that slink has been released, I'm changing the 
Release Checklist page into a Glibc 2.1 on Alpha page.

<p>A quick thanks to everyone involved thusfar.  You've done a fabulous
job and we wouldn't be this far without everyone's help</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's (now Compaq's) Alpha family of processors. Even though
the Alpha family boasts incredible speed all around, it particularly
excels in floating point operations. Thus, it's becoming the platform
of choice for scientific computing and mathematical research.  And,
with Compaq's stated commitment to supporting and continuing the Alpha
processor line, we are guaranteed to enjoy this raw computing
power for years to come.</p>

<P>The Alpha port of Linux is rapidly becoming the OS of choice for
most Alpha owners. It is not only "familiar" to Linux-Intel users, it
is also 64-bit clean and very fast on these advanced processors. While
many still dual-boot over to Digital Unix, many only do so to compile
mathematical software that they wish to run on Linux (Linux-Alpha will
run DU binaries with the proper libraries installed and kernel
support).</p>

<P>Awhile ago, the powers that be in the Debian project decided
to branch out and try to port the distribution to as many platforms as
Linux would run on. Since that decision, those of us who prefer Debian
and wanted to help have jumped in and worked hard on porting hundreds
of packages over to the Alpha.  If you'd like to join us in this
project, please peruse this page and join the mailing list. Things
can be fast-moving and we all realise that not everyone has the
technical expertise to do it all, but any help that people can or want
to offer would be gladly accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!</i></p>

<h2><b>Who are we?</b></h2>

<P>Since there's no clearly defined "team" here, it's hard to say who's
in on this and who's just visiting from time to time.  In the end, we're
all working towards the same end.  Here's the people that are most often
seen on the debian-alpha list:</P>

<ul>

<li><A HREF="mailto:chris@classnet.med.miami.edu">Chris Chimelis</A><br>
(me)...better known as "The Human Package-Compiling Machine" :-)  For the
most part, I compile packages....LOTS of packages...and generally try to
address software porting issues.  I also handle most problems with our
egcs and maintain binutils and libffm, so if you have a question or problem with
any of those, let me know.</li>

<li>Paul Slootman<br>
Paul is another person who's compiling tons of packages.  He's also really
good at porting those "rip-your-hair-out" packages that we all seem to need
but nobody wants to port.</li>

<li>Bart Warmerdam<br>
The latest addition to our ad-hoc package compilation team.  Bart has
successfully ported a bunch of previously untouched packages.  Hats
off to Bart, keep up the good work!</li>

<li>Loic Prylli<br>
Has put together some really great installation disk sets.  Loic is
has just finished the final installation disk sets and CD images for the release
of "slink" for Alphas.  I just did an installation using a recent 
set and must applaud the effort put into this.  Loic, the disks worked
great and I didn't run into a problem AT ALL during installation.  Thanks!</li> 

<li>Mikolaj J. Habryn<br>
Fixed a VERY serious problem recently in glibc and the kernel that was
exposed by dpkg.  Thanks to Mikolaj for resolving this for all of us!</li>
