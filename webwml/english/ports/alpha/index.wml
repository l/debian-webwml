<h1>Debian-Alpha</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's Alpha family of processors. Even though the Alpha family
boasts incredible speed all around, it particularly excels in floating
point operations. Thus, it's becoming the platform of choice for
scientific computing and mathematical research.</p>

<P>The Alpha port of Linux is rapidly becoming the OS of choice for
most Alpha owners. It is not only "familiar" to Linux-Intel users, it
is also 64-bit clean and very fast on these advanced processors. While
many still dual-boot over to Digital Unix, many only do so to compile
mathematical software that they wish to run on Linux (Linux-Alpha will
run DU binaries with the proper libraries installed and kernel
support).</p>

<P>Not too long ago, the powers that be in the Debian project decided
to branch out and try to port the distribution to as many platforms as
Linux would run on. Since that decision, those of us who prefer Debian
and wanted to help have jumped in and worked hard on porting hundreds
of packages over to the Alpha.  If you'd like to join us in this
project, please peruse this page and join the mailing list. Things
can be fast-moving and we all realise that not everyone has the
technical expertise to do it all, but any help that people can or want
to offer would be gladly accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!</i></p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>Currently, we have the following
already accomplished:</p>

<UL>
<LI><B>A working set of base "disks" (now being
revamped for new packages).</B></LI>

<LI>
<B>Conversion to egcs-1.1a in progress.</B><br>
While egcs still has some problems, it's FAR better than the alternatives
for the Alpha and is really spiffy to install :-)</LI>

<LI>
<B>GLIBC 2.0.7t-based development environment.</B></LI>

<LI><B>ALOT of library packages have been ported.</B><br>
This has been facilitated by the GLIBC move on the x86.</LI>

<LI><B>Apt functionality tested and functioning.</B><br>
Apt is up and working.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Lots of other packages have been ported
already.</B> Everything is now being uploaded to master with the
exception of the base disks, which are still being worked on, so
finding packages isn't as hard as it used to be.</LI>
</UL>

<p>The following needs to be done:</p>

<UL>
<LI>
<LI>
<B>Jade package needs help.</B>  I'm really running out of time on this
one and running low on personal time to work on this.  If anyone is
interested in working on this themselves, please let me know and I'll
get you caught up on the situation.  Be aware that it takes AWHILE to
compile jade on a UDB, even for testing, so be warned (not as long as
egcs, fyi, but an hour or more just for libsp.a alone).  This is REALLY
important and we need it to work really soon.  I'm currently testing the
idea of splitting off an Alpha-only jade package.  Suggestions are welcome.

<LI>
<B>Tons of packages left to port and package.</B><br>
Trying to keep up with the x86 maintainers is slowly killing me and the
other Alpha porters, but we're staying afloat.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Dselect stability. </B><br>
Right now,
dselect still causes some problems if pointed at and updating from the
master archive. This is being worked on. Check with the mailing
list for the bleeding-edge status on this and/or to find out how to help
with this. In short, it all is related to dependencies.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Docs, docs, and more docs. </B>We
need to create documents and instructions for things like installation
and autobooting the different Alpha machines.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Centralisation of boot tools and files.
</B>Even if we just mirror DEC's archive, it would help to make the master
archive a "one-stop shoppe" for MILO and boot kernels and tools.
I'm going to be working on this myself soon.</LI>

</UL>

<B>Other ideas:</B>
<BR>I'd like to do some testing on Ruffians
(Samsung MB-based systems). Apparently, they have some strange problems.
If I could get my hands on some newer equipment, I'd be a very happy camper
:-)

<h2>Who are we?</h2>

<p>Since I'm throwing this page together,
I only feel comfortable including myself for now. If anyone else
wants to be linked in here, please let me know.</p>

<p><i>Actually, Chris isn't responsible for the current design of
	these pages. They have been coerced into Debian's house style
	by <a href="mailto:jules@debian.org">Jules Bean</a>.  However, 
	Chris is still the maintainer, and the one to contact with
	comments.

<p><i>Nice going, Jules :-)  Keep up the good work....C</i></p>

<p>I can provide quite a bit of tech support
regarding Debian-Alpha and also can provide a good idea as to the latest
status on the project. Currently, I'm porting just about every package
that isn't already done. Basically, if you have a minor question
or just want to know what's going on, drop me an e-mail and I'll get back
to you. If it's a more general Debian-Linux question, please post
it to the debian-alpha mailing list. Oh, and you can call me Chris
if you'd like :)</p>
