<h2>News</h2>

<p><b>24 February 1999</b></p>
<p>Glibc 2.1 testing has begun<br>
Yes, that's right, I've begun testing the much-anticipated glibc 2.1.
So far, despite MANY reports that it breaks alot of things, I haven't
had any problems since recompiling a few key libs (which I have debs
for now).  I even have played with IPv6 support and it works like a
dream.  For more information, write me (Chris Chimelis) and I'll fill
you in.  NOTE: if you plan on testing it as well, be aware that,
despite the fact that glibc 2.1 is released, the Debian package is
still unofficial, so there may be inherent problems that haven't been
addressed yet.  Also, be aware that, once installed, any binaries
compiled on the system will be linked against it, which makes uploads
to master out of the question until the official glibc 2.1 debs are
uploaded.
</p>
<p>In other news, the release date for slink is looking to be 2 March 1999.
As expected, the Alpha port of 2.1 is due to roll with the others (i386,
m68k, and sparc).  I'll post further when I hear more...</p>

<P><B><CENTER>For the latest status on the port, check the
<A HREF="release-checklist">Release Checklist</A>
page for more details.</CENTER></B></p>

<p>A quick thanks to everyone involved thusfar.  You've done a fabulous
job and we wouldn't be this far without everyone's help</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The purpose of these pages is to assist developers and others
interested with the ongoing project to port the Debian distribution of
Linux to DEC's (now Compaq's) Alpha family of processors. Even though
the Alpha family boasts incredible speed all around, it particularly
excels in floating point operations. Thus, it's becoming the platform
of choice for scientific computing and mathematical research.  And,
with Compaq's stated commitment to supporting and continuing the Alpha
processor line, we are guaranteed to enjoy this raw computing
power for years to come.</p>

<P>The Alpha port of Linux is rapidly becoming the OS of choice for
most Alpha owners. It is not only "familiar" to Linux-Intel users, it
is also 64-bit clean and very fast on these advanced processors. While
many still dual-boot over to Digital Unix, many only do so to compile
mathematical software that they wish to run on Linux (Linux-Alpha will
run DU binaries with the proper libraries installed and kernel
support).</p>

<P>Awhile ago, the powers that be in the Debian project decided
to branch out and try to port the distribution to as many platforms as
Linux would run on. Since that decision, those of us who prefer Debian
and wanted to help have jumped in and worked hard on porting hundreds
of packages over to the Alpha.  If you'd like to join us in this
project, please peruse this page and join the mailing list. Things
can be fast-moving and we all realise that not everyone has the
technical expertise to do it all, but any help that people can or want
to offer would be gladly accepted.</p>

<P><i>Cheers and happy Alpha-ing!</i></p>

<h2><b>Who are we?</b></h2>

<P>Since there's no clearly defined "team" here, it's hard to say who's
in on this and who's just visiting from time to time.  In the end, we're
all working towards the same end.  Here's the people that are most often
seen on the debian-alpha list:</P>

<ul>

<li><A HREF="mailto:chris@classnet.med.miami.edu">Chris Chimelis</A><br>
(me)...better known as "The Human Package-Compiling Machine" :-)  For the
most part, I compile packages....LOTS of packages...and generally try to
address software porting issues.  I also handle most problems with our
egcs and maintain binutils and libffm, so if you have a question or problem with
any of those, let me know.</li>

<li>Paul Slootman<br>
Paul is another person who's compiling tons of packages.  He's also really
good at porting those "rip-your-hair-out" packages that we all seem to need
but nobody wants to port.</li>

<li>Bart Warmerdam<br>
The latest addition to our ad-hoc package compilation team.  Bart has
successfully ported a bunch of previously untouched packages.  Hats
off to Bart, keep up the good work!</li>

<li>Loic Prylli<br>
Has put together some really great installation disk sets.  Loic is
currently finishing up the final installation disk set for the release
of "slink" for Alphas.  I just did an installation using the latest
set and must applaud the effort put into this.  Loic, the disks worked
great and I didn't run into a problem AT ALL during installation.  Thanks!</li> 

<li>Mikolaj J. Habryn<br>
Fixed a VERY serious problem recently in glibc and the kernel that was
exposed by dpkg.  Thanks to Mikolaj for resolving this for all of us!</li>
