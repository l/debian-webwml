<h1>Debian-PowerPC</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The PowerPC port started at the end of 1996.  After the german <a
href="http://www.linux-kongress.de/">Linux Kongress</a> in
W&uuml;rzburg where the Debian project was sponsored a <a
href="http://www.infodrom.north.de/Infodrom/tervola.html">PowerPC</a>
for development issues, this port became a real basis.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>The current state of the port is still development.  It runs on
both PreP and CHRP machines.  About 50% of the packages are
already compiled for the PowerPC architecture, amount increasing. </p>

<p> Here is a short <i>(and possibly out of date? - Ed.)</i> to do
    list for the port.
<ol>
<li> Install system with new glibc: done on sda2
<li> See if the system works or crashes
<li> If it works, re-install it on hda7 and get tervola boot it
<li> Set up some kind of auto-compiler
</ol>
</p>
