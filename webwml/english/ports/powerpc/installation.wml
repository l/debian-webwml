<h1>Installing Debian GNU/Linux on PowerPC machines</h1>

<em>Parts of this may be out-dated.</em>

<ol>
<li> <b>Get and install StuffIt</b><p>

<p>We're sorry, but the only way to get this is to get a Mac-formated
disk from another Mac.  After copying StuffIt on the machine you
should try to start the program and place it in the 'System
folder' (don't know what this is called in english, 'cause I had a
german MacOS, -Joey).</p>

<p>After that you can copy *.hqx files using a simple msdos formated
disk.  Insert the floppy in the PPC and use drag-and-drop, just
select the file, hold the left mouse button down and move it onto
the StuffIt symbol on the desktop.</p>

<li> <p><b>Get and install pdisk from MkLinux</b></p>

<p>Ftp to ftp.mklinux.apple.com, it has a package called pdisk in the
directory Other_tools within the DR2.1 directory.</p>

<li> <p><b>Partition your disks</b></p>

<p>Start `pdisk' and press 'L' (show maps from all disks).  If you
get nothing here you just have encountered a big problem.  You
need to have scsi disks - (e)-ide disks aren't recognized.</p>

<p>If you have fresh disks or disks that come from other platforms,
just 'e'dit the map and create a new one.  Don't forget to write
the new one.</p>

<li> <b>Boot Variables 1.3</b>

<p>You can get them from <a href="ftp://cap.anu.edu.au/pub/linux-pmac/bootvars-1.3.sit.hqx">australia</a>.
This program is an interface to Open Firmware (OF) that
offers you a basic interface to the system.  Here you can
define from which disks the machine should boot and which
parameters are passed over to the booting system.</p>
