Here are some highlights of the PowerMac installation of Debian. For
detailed instructions, please study the fine Installation Manual. The
Debian Installer team have spent many long hours attempting to answer
your questions in advance and give you excellent written guidance as
you install Debian.

<p>

It is certainly possible, and there are actually quite elegant
solutions for the NewWorld Macs, to dual boot your Debian PowerMac
system with Mac OS and/or Mac OS X. If you are planning on doing a new
installation of Mac OS X, though, do it before installing Debian. The
Mac OS X installer is very unkind to existing systems when it
installs. Shortly, you may also have the option of running Debian
within a Darwin system.

<p>

As a general rule, hardware newer than 2001 or so is more well
supported by the more-recent 2.4 series of Linux kernels. The standard
Debian installation still uses the 2.2 series, which will basically
work. But the accessories such as sound, sleep, airport, and the like
are not supported well, if at all, in the 2.2 series. So if you have a
newer machine, go through the normal installation, then plan on one
extra step when you get done to upgrade the kernel. Debian has made
the kernel upgrade process as easy as getting a new program - and
that itself is very easy in Debian.

<p> 

You will need to partition your disk; Linux must be installed on its
own partition(s). If you have a single-disk system, that will entail
backing up everything on your system and restoring it after
partitioning is complete. Some third-party partitioning tools may be
able to 'shrink' a partition so you have room for more partitions on
your disk without destroying what's already there, but they will
undoubtedly advise a backup also. Drive Setup does not offer that
option, it erases the entire drive.

<p>

1G is probably enough space for an experimental Linux system. You can
get by with less, perhaps as little as 200M for a really basic system,
but you'll more than likely want more than just the basics.

<p>

After partitioning your disk, you will need to obtain an installation
CD or download the installer system. Once you finally sit down to do
the installation (preferably with installation manual in hand), you
will probably burn up 2 or 3 hours making it happen. An experienced
installer can get a basic install done in under half an hour.

<p>

if you're really uncomfortable with command lines, then install the X
desktop after you've finished the basic system install. But give it a
second thought, too: there's a world of power in the Linux command
line. Some things that are very difficult to do in a graphical
interface are very fast and efficient on the command line. Also, since
the Linux system is command-line based, there are some functions which
are only accessible from the command line. The default system sets up
6 command line consoles, and one graphical one. You can get a lot of
work done in those other consoles while you're browsing the web... and
that way you can have the best of both worlds.

<p>

The PowerPC platform runs really well with Linux. It's highly
respected in much of the Linux world. Enjoy, and remember to give
something back!
