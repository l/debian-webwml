 What will you find there? Well, not packages. kernel-package doesn't
 like me, or I'm doing something wrong. So no packages yet. (Did I
 mention the fact I'm not a registered Debian developer either? ;)
</p>

<p>
 You'll find the following 'generic' kernels for making RS/6000
 bootdisks, or compiling your own source. This is subject to change, as
 I'm still building things, or at least trying to. ;)
</p>

<ul>
<il> rs6000-ppc60x-2.2.6.image.gz </il>
<il> rs6000-ppc60xsmp-2.2.6.image.gz </il>
<il> rs6000-ppc7xx-2.2.6.image.gz </il>
<il> rs6000-ppc7xxsmp-2.2.6.image.gz </il>
<il> rs6000-2.2.6.source.tar.gz </il>
</ul>

<p>
 NONE of these are really tested. The source compiles with gcc 2.7.2.3
 vanilla fine, and 2.7.2.3-RS6k (my own little hacks) correctly. The
 Makefiles have been modified to correctly pick up PowerPC-based
 machines. I don't garauntee that ANY of these kernels will work
 perfectly, or even boot, on your RS/6000. If it does, tell me. If
 it doesn't, tell me why it doesn't. I don't have a machine to test
 on currently, so I'm going mostly from memory and older (just >3
 months old) work I've done. If anybody wants to donate any older
 RS/6000's (ie; POWER2, P2SC based ones, or Cxx models) please email
 me privately <a href="mailto:PJaenke@unicent.com"> Phillip R. Jaenke
 &#139PJaenke@unicent.com&#155</a>. I'll be more than glad to pay
 shipping. Still working on getting the independent Linux-RS/6000 Project
 going, but it's in the middle of total reorganization right now. (Ah,
 I love chaos. Chaos, chaos, everywhere, and not a thought to think. ;)
 I'll probably elaborate on that situation on debian-devel within the
 coming weeks for those who are that interested. ;) Anyways, give these
 kernels a shot, and let me know how they work or don't work for you. Have
 fun. :) And don't blame me if you screw your JFS partitions, either. ;)
