<h2>Download</h2>

To install Debian GNU/Linux on a PReP system download the following files:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-powerpc/current/prep/boot1440.bin">boot.bin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-powerpc/current/prep/resc1440.bin">resc1440.bin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-powerpc/current/prep/drv14-1.bin">drv14-1.bin</a></li>
<li><a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/disks-powerpc/current/common/base2_2.tgz">base2_2.tgz</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
 Floppy installation is not currently available due to the current size of the
 boot image and the rescue disk.  bootprep.bin must be booted via tftp and the
 installer images must be installed via nfs.
</p>


<h2>Documentation</h2>
<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>
 IBM and Motorola both make or have made PReP architecture machines. At this point,
 the PReP support has only been tested on Motorola legacy PowerStack(tm) (Blackhawk,
 Comet, Utah motherboard) systems and the current embedded solution in the PowerPlus(tm)
 family. These include the MTX, MTX+, MVME2300(sc)/2400/2600/2700/3600/4600, and MCP(n)750.
 IBM produces a variety of desktop workstation that are PowerPC PReP compliant. I don't
 have model numbers but would welcome any input here.
</p> 


<h3>Known Problems</h3>
<p>
 Interrupt handling is broken in the included kernel image on Motorola legacy systems.
 I have a fix tested, but haven't yet rolled it back into the installer images. Don't
 attempt to install to a PowerStack until I have updated these, you will be wasting i
 your time.
</p>
<p>
 MTX+ (7 PCI slot MTX system) cannot boot this kernel, it hangs on the IDE driver
 initialization. This is under investigation.
</p>
<p>
 All Motorola PowerPlus systems have broken IDE support in the kernel. This has been 
 fixed on some machines and still needs incorporated in the Debian images. Please use
 SCSI, life will be easy.
</p>


<h3>Firmware</h3>
<p>
 Depending on the age and/or maker of your PReP system you will have either PPCBUG
 (Motorola) or Open Firmware (IBM or Motorola). The boot commands are slightly
 different but both systems implement PReP style booting and provide residual data
 to the boot image as detailed in the PReP and Residual Data standards. A complete
 explanation of firmware commands is out of the scope of this document but some 
 information will be provided where necessary.
</p>


<h3>Setup for installation</h3>
<p>
 You need a tftp/nfs server to do the install at this point as the boot and rescue disks 
 are too big for a 1.44MB floppy. I have bootable PReP base install CD's but things need 
 to be cleaned up a bit before I post an ISO image for public consumption. Place the rescue,
 drivers, and base tarball image in your exported nfs directory. Place the bootprep.bin 
 image in your tftp directory. On Motorola PPCBUG systems you may boot and install using 
 either VGA console or serial console. PPCBUG and Linux will fall back to serial console 
 mode if no VGA or keyboard is detected.
</p>


<h3>Booting</h3>
<dl>
<dt> PPCBUG
<dd> Use the "ENV" command and turn on the "Network PReP boot enable" option.
<dd>
<dd> Use the "NIOT" command to configure the client, server, and optional gateway IP addr
     that will be used to tftp the kernel. If it is a brand new board, be sure to
     "SET <date/time>" to start the hwclock or networking and other things will not function.
<dd>
<dd> Boot the image with "NBO 0 0 ,,, bootprep.bin"
<dd>
<dt> OF
<dd>
<dd> Use the following command to tftp boot a PReP image:
<dd>
<dd> "boot &#139server_ipaddr&#155,&#139file&#155,&#139client_ipaddr&#155"
</dl>



<h2>Debian Installation</h2>
<ol>
<li> Configure the keyboard
<p>
 If on serial console, the configure keyboard step is skipped.
</p>

<li> Partition the harddrive
<p>
 On a Motorola system the default is for the kernel to root from /dev/sda2.
 So, partition the harddrive to have a type 41 PReP boot partition as
 /dev/sda1 and the root partition as /dev/sda2. After that you may choose
 any configuration you like.  
</p>

<p>
 On an IBM system the default is for the kernel to root from /dev/hda1.
 Parition the harddrive to have a type 41 PReP boot partition as /dev/sda2
 and the root partition as /dev/hda1. AFter that you may choose any
 configuration you like.
</p>

<li> Install Rescue and Driver disks
<p>
 STOP!  First skip down to "Configure Network". Configure your network as it asks.
</p>
<p>
 Now, when you select "Install Rescue and Driver disks" a new NFS install
 method will appear. Choose it and point it at the NFS directory you set
 up earlier. Choose the defaults for the rest of the question and it will
 install the rescue and driver images.
</p>

<li> Configure Driver modules
<p>
 For now, important modules are built in the kernel so just choose "Exit".
</p>

<li> Install Base System
<p>
 Again, choose the NFS option. Point it at the NFS install directory and
 choose the defaults to install the Debian base system.
</p>

<li> Configure Base System
<p>
 Answer prompts.
</p>

<li> Make bootable from harddrive:
<p>
 Will write a kernel image to the type 41 PReP boot partition. If you didn't make one your should get an error here.
</p>

<li> Make boot floppy
<p>
 Will write a kernel image to a floppy in the drive.
</p>

<li> Reboot
<p>
 Choose this to reboot and continue installation.
</p>
</ol>

<h2>Debian Base System boot</h2>
<p>
 If you configured a type 41 PReP boot partition and had the installtion
 program make the system bootable from the hard drive then you can simply
 issue a firmware boot command to have it boot from hard disk (PPCBUG and
 OF both have autoboot options you may also turn on).
</p>

<dt>PPCBUG
<dd>
<dd>"PBOOT 0" (assumes SCSI disk on controller 0, SCSI ID 0)
<dd>"PBOOT 0 x0" (boots from SCSI disk on controller 0, SCSI ID x)
<dd>
<dt>OF
<dd>
<dd>"boot disk0" (for installed IDE/SCSI disk aliased to disk0)
<dd>"boot hdisk0" (for installed IDE/SCSI disk aliased to hdisk0)
</dl>
<p>
 Now the kernel boots from the hard disk.
</p>

<h2>Debian Final Installation</h2>
<p>
 Answer the remaining configuration questions. The keyboard configuration
 will moan and complain if you are on a serial console. Ignore it, it is
 harmless and will be skipped in a future version if on serial console.
</p>

<p>
 Choose a system profile if you like. It is best to choose a small one
 since there are dependency problems in potato since it is the unstable
 development tree. When you enter dselect, choose [A]ccess and select the
 apt method. Keep the default URI to the master debian site, change the
 distribution to "unstable" and keep the default sections. Now [U]pdate
 the package list to get the latest list from the Debian master site.
 Choose [I]nstall and all the package will be installed. You will be
 required to answer a good number of questions when it goes through the
 configuration phase.
</p>

<p>
 After this completes you should be present with a login prompt and your
 installation is complete.
