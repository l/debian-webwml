<h1>Debian for PA-RISC</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

Debian's port to PA-RISC is just getting started.  
<a href="http://www.thepuffingroup.com/parisc">The Puffin Group</a>
is working hard on the kernel, compiler, C library, and platform-specific 
utilities.  Several
Debian developers are contributing to that effort, and intend to start
populating a Debian binary-hppa tree as soon as the Puffin system is 
capable of hosting native compilation.

<p>

If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-hppa mailing 
list, documented below!

<li><b>Name Change</b><p>
<p>
At OLS, the issue of using 'parisc' vs 'hppa' for the Debian architecture
string was finally decided, in favor of 'hppa'.  This ports page is being
moved to reflect the change, and a request is in the works to rename the 
debian-parisc mailing list to debian-hppa.
