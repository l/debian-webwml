<h1>Debian for PA-RISC</h1>

<h2>Status</h2>

Debian's port to PA-RISC is starting to gather momentum, but there's a lot of
work left to do.  HP and Linuxcare employees are working hard on the kernel, 
compiler, C library, and platform-specific utilities.  Several Debian 
developers are contributing to that effort, and have begun to populate a 
binary-hppa tree in the Debian 'sid' tree.

<p>

We hope to be a supported Debian architecture with the 'woody' release.

If you would like to help, start by subscribing to the debian-hppa mailing 
list, documented below!

<li><b>Binary Trees Created</b><p>
<p>
Binary trees for the hppa architecture were added to the 'sid' distribution
on Debian's master site today.  Bdale is running an auto-builder, and packages
should start showing up on Debian mirror sites shortly.  Installation info and
some critical packages are still available only through the 
<a href="http://www.thepuffingroup.com/parisc/"> Puffin </a> 
web site, however.

<li><b>Name Change</b><p>
<p>
At OLS, the issue of using 'parisc' vs 'hppa' for the Debian architecture
string was finally decided, in favor of 'hppa'.  This ports page is being
moved to reflect the change, and a request is in the works to rename the 
debian-parisc mailing list to debian-hppa.
