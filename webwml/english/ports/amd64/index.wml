<h2>Debian on AMD64</h2>

<p>This page is meant to assist users and Debian developers running
Debian GNU/Linux on the AMD64 architecture. Here, you will find
information about the current status of the port, which machines are
publically accessible by developers, where to discuss development of
the port, where to get further information about Debian porters, and
pointers to more information.</p>


<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>The unofficial stable release of the Debian AMD64 port was released by the 
porting team on June 8th, 2005.</p>

<p>The testing and unstable releases of the AMD64 port are currently 
waiting to be included into the official Debian archive. The Debian-amd64
archive is currently hosted on 
<a href="http://amd64.debian.net/">amd64.debian.net</a>.

The port consists of kernels for all AMD 64bit CPUs with <i>AMD64</i> 
extension and all Intel CPUs with <i>EM64T</i> extension, and a common 
64bit userspace.</p>

<p>The stable release of the unofficial port is based on unpatched Sarge 
sources and has full security support by the Debian Security Team. 
The Debian-Backports and -Volatile services are fully supported, too.</p>


<h2>A complete 64bit userland</h2>

<p>The AMD64 port is thoroughly 64bit, allowing the user to benefit from all 
advantages this architecture has compared to i386:
</p>
<ul>
<li>no memory segmentation in low and high memory</li>
<li>up to 512GiB virtual address space per process (instead of 2GiB)</li>
<li>1TiB physical memory support instead of 4GiB (or 64GiB with the PAE 
extension)</li>
<li>16 general purpose registers in the CPU instead of 8</li>
<li>gcc defaults to SSE2 math instead of 387 FPU</li>
<li>gcc omits frame-pointers by default at -O2</li>
<li>compilation time optimization uses a common base for AMD64/EM64T instead of legacy i386 cruft</li>
<li>memory pages are not executable by default</li>
</ul>

<p>Native execution of legacy 32bit binaries is supported by the kernel, and 
core libraries are provided by the ia32-libs package.</p>


<h2>Minimalistic AMD64 runtime support for i386</h2>

<p>The official i386 distribution actually includes minimalistic AMD64 
support, consisting of a 64bit kernel, gcc-3.4 able to create 64bit binaries 
and the amd64-libs package to run third-party amd64 binaries with native shared
libraries.</p>


<h2>The unofficial Debian-AMD64 Sarge release</h2>

<p>Release notes are to be found <a href="http://amd64.debian.net/docs/release-notes/">on amd64.debian.net</a>.</p>

<p>Netinst and businesscard ISOs as well as full CD and DVD sets of the 
unofficial Sarge release are available 
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/sarge-amd64/">on cdimage.debian.org</a>.

<p>A list of known mirrors can be found <a href="http://amd64.debian.net/README.mirrors.html">on amd64.debian.net</a>, but there may be more.</p>


<h2>The future of Debian-AMD64</h2>

<p>The AMD64 architecture will be added to the official archive after Sarge
is released. Thus, the next official stable Debian release - codename
 <b>Etch</b> - will have full native amd64 support.</p>

<p>The unofficial Sarge distribution is hosted 
<a href="http://amd64.debian.net/">on amd64.debian.net</a>. The porters team
promises to support the unofficial Sarge for the same time period as Debian
supports the official Sarge.</p>

<p>The Debian Security Team supports updates to the unofficial Sarge release,
which are made available <a href="http://security.debian.org/">on security.debian.org</a>.
