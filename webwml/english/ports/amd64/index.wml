<h2>Debian on AMD64</h2>

<p>This page is meant to assist users and Debian developers running
Debian GNU/Linux on the AMD64 architecture. Here, you will find
information about the current status of the port, which machines are
publically accessible by developers, where to discuss development of
the port, where to get further information about Debian porters, and
pointers to more information.</p>


<h2>Current Status</h2>

<p>The AMD64 port is currently waiting to be included into the official 
Debian archive. The development archive is currently hosted on 
<a href="http://amd64.debian.net/">amd64.debian.net</a>.

The port consists of kernels for all AMD 64bit CPUs with <i>AMD64</i> 
extension and all Intel CPUs with <i>EM64T</i> extension, and a common 
userspace.</p>

<p>Currently, the port consists of an unofficial archive containing a 
complete 64bit binary port of both unstable and testing distributions.</p>

<p>Additionally, limited AMD64 runtime support is provided in the i386 
testing and unstable distributions.</p>


<h2>A complete 64bit userland</h2>

<p>The AMD64 port is thoroughly 64bit, allowing the user to benefit from all 
advantages this architecture has compared to i386:
<ul>
<li>no memory segmentation in low and high memory</li>
<li>up to 32TB virtual addess space per process (instead of 2GB)</li>
<li>128GB physical memory support instead of 4GB (or 64GB with the PAE extension)</li>
<li>16 registers in the CPU instead of 8</li>
<li>gcc defaults to sse math instead of 387 fpu</li>
<li>gcc omits frame-pointers by default</li>
<li>compilation time optimization uses a common base for amd64/em64t instead of legacy i386 cruft</li>
<li>memory pages are not executable by default</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Native execution of legacy 32bit binaries is supported by the kernel, and 
core libraries are provided by the ia32-libs package.</p>


<h2>Minimalistic AMD64 runtime support for i386</h2>

<p>The official i386 distributions actually includes minimalistic AMD64 
support, consisting of a 64bit kernel, gcc-3.4 able to create 64bit binaries 
and the amd64-libs package to run third-party amd64 binaries with native shared
libraries.</p>



<h2>The future of Debian-AMD64</h2>

<p>The AMD64 port will be added to the official archives after Sarge is 
released. The next stable Debian release, codename <b>Etch</b>, will have 
native amd64 support.</p>

<p>The unofficial Sarge distribution is hosted on amd64.debian.net. The 
porters team promises to support the unofficial Sarge for the same time 
period as Debian supports the official Sarge.</p>

<p>Security updates for the unofficial Sarge distribution will be made 
available in sync with official Debian security updates -- for exact details 
please come back later or watch the debian-amd64 mailing list for news.</p>
