<p>Being the first architecture supported by Debian,
most of the general Debian web pages apply to this port.</p>

<p>There is some information specific to this architecture, however, that we
will list here.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<p>If you wish to install Debian, you should look at the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/">installation instructions</a>
whether you are installing from a CD or downloading off the
Internet.</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<p>
The build servers for this architecture are operated by
