and the first one supported by Debian, most of the general Debian web
pages apply to this port.

<p>There is some information specific to this architecture, however, that we
will list here.

<h2>Installing</h2>

<a href="../../releases/stable/#new-inst">installation instructions</a>
whether you are installing from a CD or downloading off the
internet.

<h2>i386 buildd</h2>

<p>The build daemon for this architecture runs on samosa.debian.org, and is
operated by Roman Hodek and James Troup.
