<h1>Debian GNU/NetBSD for Alpha</h1>


<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This port is currently at a very preliminary stage.  Currently, it
cannot boot of its own, but a build chroot which is hosted on a native
NetBSD-alpha system is setup.  Some basic packages are already done,
and it is now even possible to build some packages with:</p>

<pre class="input">
    (chroot)# dpkg-source -x package.dsc
    (chroot)# cd package-*
    (chroot)# dpkg-buildpackage -d -us -uc
</pre>

<p>However, the chroot to build these packages in is still using most
of NetBSD's libraries (in particular its libc), along with gcc and
binutils.  The current subgoal is to build a fully working
<em>native</em> Debian tool chain.  There are some <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2002/debian-bsd-200201/msg00203.html">issues</a>
with this, so any help is greatly appreciated.</p>


<h2>Available Packages</h2>

<p>Most of the binary packages produced so far did compile with
little to no changes, although some features had to be turned off for
now due to the lack of some build dependencies.</p>
