Debian GNU/NetBSD
</h1>

<p><strong><font color=red>
This porting effort has long been abandoned. It has had no updates since october
2002. The information in this page is only for historical purposes.
</font></strong></p>

<p>
Debian GNU/NetBSD is a port of the Debian Operating System to the
NetBSD kernel. It is currently in an early stage of development - however, it
can now be installed from scratch.

</p>

<h2>
How to install
</h2>

<p>
Download the floppy images from the above link. For laptops, use the laptop
images - for all other machines, use the normal ones. Write these images to 
floppies. Boot off the first disk - you will be prompted to swap disks. Once
the menu system has appeared, follow the instructions that you are presented
with.
</p>

<h2>
TODO
</h2>

<p>
Packages that need to be produced
</p>

<ul>
<li>
any of the libs in <kbd>/lib</kbd> or <kbd>/usr/lib</kbd> that aren't
currently packaged need to be
</li>
<li>
  base-passwd is desperately unhappy
  <update>
    We now have a basically working base-passwd for FreeBSD and             
    NetBSD (modulo a segfault).  Thanks to Nathan and Matthew.              
  </update>
</li>
<li>equivalents of console-tools/data need to be produced
    <update>
      Packages that provide the basic functionality have been produced
    </update>
</li>
<li>
netbase needs to be rebuilt. This is probably one of the more awkward
ones - we have source for the BSD versions of ifconfig et al, but the
semantics are somewhat different. If we stick with BSD semantics, we
have to deal with any scripts that assume Linux-style semantics. Does
the Hurd follow Linux-style semantics, and if not how have they dealt with
this?
  <update>
     Marcus Brinkmann from the Hurd Team
     <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2002/debian-bsd-200202/msg00087.html">\
     clarified</a> this a bit and sketched possible solutions. The current
     approach is to use the NetBSD tools and modify ifupdown in order to 
     provide the same interface to the user.
  </update>
</li>
<li>procps (probably best to just provide the BSD versions)</li>
# link dead <li>sysklogd
#  (we can probably use <a
#  href="http://packages.debian.org/msyslog">msyslog</a> instead)
#
#  <update>
#     <a href="http://packages.debian.org/msyslog">msyslog</a> works on
#     NetBSD (modulo some hickups related to paths of files)
#  </update>
#</li>
<li>sysvinit
  (BSD init doesn't support runlevels. We can hack it to work
  like Debian with a single runlevel without too much trouble)
  <update>
    sysvinit is up and running, Matthew has managed to boot natively
    into Debian GNU/NetBSD on i386!  There are still some glitches
    wrt. boot scripts, but it's an important step
    towards a fully working system.
  </update>
</li>
<li><a href="http://packages.debian.org/fakeroot">fakeroot</a>
  <update>
    Fakeroot now works.
  </update>
</li>
<li>XFree86
    (Nathan is having a go at this currently, and discovered that
    <a href="http://packages.debian.org/ed">ed</a> is needed, which
    segfaults.  Several people are investigating on this issue.)

    <update>
        ed works when building with libed.a.  Also, quoting Joel:
	<q>X11 is in a workable state</q>!  It's not packaged
	properly, but it works.  Expect packages soon.
    </update>
</li>
<li>gcc-3.0
    (Neither gcc-3.0.1 nor gcc-current are in a usable state for
    NetBSD at the moment.  Joel has a working version of gcc-current
    and posted the <a
    href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-bsd/2002/debian-bsd-200202/msg00137.html">results
    of the test suite</a>.  libstdc++ is still very unhappy.)

    <update>
        gcc-3.0.4 has been released and now <a
        href="http://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-3.0/features.html">supports
        NetBSD ELF systems</a> (at least for the x86 target).
