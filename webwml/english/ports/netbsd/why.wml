<h1>Why Debian GNU/NetBSD?</h1>

<ul>
<li>NetBSD runs on hardware unsupported by Linux. Porting Debian to
the NetBSD kernel increases the number of platforms that can run a
Debian-based operating system.</li>

<li>The Debian GNU/Hurd project demonstrates that Debian is not tied
to one specific kernel. However, the Hurd kernel is still relatively
immature - a Debian GNU/NetBSD system would be usable at a production
level.</li>

<li>Lessons learned from the porting of Debian to NetBSD can be used
in porting Debian to other kernels (such as <a
href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> and <a
href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a>).</li>

<li>In contrast to projects like <a href="http://fink.sf.net/">Fink</a>
or <a href="http://debian-cygwin.sf.net/">Debian GNU/w32</a>, Debian
GNU/NetBSD does not exist in order to provide extra software or a
Unix-style environment to an existing OS (the *BSD ports trees are
already comprehensive, and they unarguably provide a Unix-style
environment). Instead, a user or administrator used to a more
traditional Debian system should feel comfortable with a Debian
GNU/NetBSD system immediately and competent in a relatively short
period of time.</li>

<li>Not everybody likes the *BSD ports tree or the *BSD userland (this
is a personal preference thing, rather than any sort of comment on
quality). Linux distributions have been produced which provide *BSD
style ports or a *BSD style userland for those who like the BSD user
environment but also wish to use the Linux kernel - Debian GNU/NetBSD
is the logical reverse of this, allowing people who like the GNU
userland or a Linux-style packaging system to use the NetBSD
kernel.</li>

<li>Because we can.</li>
</ul>
