<H3>Webmasters:  This is the latest email from Jay plus annotations from me.
I mostly did this for myself to remember where I'm at and to have a common todo
between work and home</H3>

<H3>/ports/*/</H3>
  <P>All port specific information should be in the port pages. There still
  aren't any x86 port pages. Hint hint.

  <P>Don't use a directory like 2.0/ off the main page in the future. Since the
  installation instructions are port specific they should be in the appropriate
  port directory under a directory named after the release, e.g. the current
  release is hamm. This way we can keep the previous releases installation files
  around for a bit. To make the transition between releases easier you should
  create a link stable -- hamm and have release specific links use stable/
  so all you need to do is change one link to update the pages.
  For example the link to the installation instructions for x86 would be
  "http://www.debian.org/ports/x86/stable/install".

  <p>Should there be a directory under ports, ports/common, for files that
  are common to all the ports? For example, a dselect tutorial would not need
  to have copies in every port directory. Alternatively, the non-i386 ports could
  simply point to the copy in i386.

<H3>/intro/about</H3>
  <P>This page should be shortened and have the more detailed information in
  links. There has been a suggestion that we create an advocacy page with
  links to other free projects that Debian supports.

  <P>One example is licenses. I wrote a bit about them, but it really should be
  moved to its own page. We need to convince people that some licenses
  are better than others. Hmmm sounds like this should be linked from the
  advocacy page too.

  <P>Writing an intro to something like Debian is not an easy job. You really
  need to give some thought into how you split up all the (interconnected)
  issues involved.

  <P>The 'History of Debian' needs to be filled in. I believe this has been done
  already.  If so, you just need to find out where it is.

<H3>/intro/advocacy</H3>
  <P>A new page as mentioned above. The LPF needs to be linked from here (this
  is what started the idea of an advocacy page).

  <P>This should probably be created only when someone has time to redo all the
  intro documents. I have a lot of ideas on this and will do it myself if I get	
  enough time.

<H3>/doc/index</H3>
  <P>suggestion submitted:
  <UL>
  <LI>more reading material until more of the Debian Doc Project stuff is done.
  <LI>Matt Welsh's `Installation and Getting Started', the `Linux System
  <LI>Admin Guide', and a few like that would be good starters.
  </UL>

  <P>Many users are confused by the difference between the Documentation page
  and the Support page. Combining them makes a rather long page so that isn't
  really an option. I'm not sure what to do.

<H3>/security/</H3>
  <P>The security pages haven't been updated in months. It would be best if
  someone on the security teams sole responsibility was to keep the 
  debian-security-announce mailing list and the web pages up to date.

  <P>The security pages need to be updated to the new format. I am willing to
  convert them once we have someone to keep them up to date.
<I>I'm updateing these now.  Check out
<A HREF="http://master.debian.org/~gecko/security.html">here.</A>  When done,
find someone to takeover until jd get's back online</I>

<H3>/distrib/vendors</H3>
  <P>All the vendors web sites need to be checked to see that they actually
  contribute.  They should also be checked after each major release of Debian.

  <P>user suggestion: add www.linux-canada.com

  <P>Walnut Creek may sell Debian. Their web site needs to be checked.
<I>This page is being maintained by Craig Small (csmall@debian.org)</I>

  - Cc:ed to webmaster - Jay, I think this needs to be more prominently linked
  - from the developer's corner, this is becoming something of a FAQ. 

  - I think it would be nice if the Dselect Beginners guide was also
  - mentioned and linked off of the Documentation page at
  - http://www.debian.org/doc/.  This is usually a big stumbling block
  - for beginners.

  The main page currently has some links to the installation docs on
  ftp.debian.org and others on www.debian.org . They should probably all use 
  the web version as ftp.debian.org is overwhelmed (see next item though).

  All links into the archive should allow the user to select the download site.
  Jason Gunthorpe has been coordinating an improved mirror list which could be
  used to keep the list of mirrors up to date (maybe even using a script).

<H3>Mirroring issues</H3>
<ul>
<li>-Joey:#debian-devel- Can you take care of www.tr.debian.org?<BR>
    -Joey:#debian-devel- amu@turkye.net<BR>
    -Joey:#debian-devel- amu@tuerkiye.net<BR>
    -Joey:#debian-devel- He tried to get mirroring done for quite some time.<BR>
    -Joey:#debian-devel- I just checked the dns and www.tr. is still not present<BR>
    -Joey:#debian-devel- He has some turkish friends who wanted to contribute
    <br><i>I was already in contact with him and he never responded to me. Have sent
    new mail.</i>
<li>Push mirroring needs to be set up. va.debian.org (aka www.debian.org) should be one
   site. There should also be one in Europe that the other European mirrors can mirror
   from. More can be added as the need arises.
</ul>

<H3>Packages pages</H3>
New page generation scripts are ready to go online (Oct 19). Just need to get the
old ones shut off (controlled by Nick Lichtmaier).

<p>The only outstanding item after this is to generate pages for the non-i386 ports.
Anyone got ideas on doing this without replicating the entire page structure for
each port? Having one page for each package name could be quite confusing. The pages
could end up being quite long. To shorten the length a table would need to be made.
How then to handle dependencies as they sometimes change between versions (and the
different ports often have different versions of packages).

Any suggestions on this would be appreciated.

<H3>Awards and Recognition Page</H3>
We need to create one for all our awards... such as the Coral letter, the Best
of the Net, the other one that I forgot.... but is in the October news section
and any old ones we've got

<H3>Events Pages</H3>
we need to create an events section similar to what we do for the News and
Security and such..
