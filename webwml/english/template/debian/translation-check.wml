# This file is used to track when translations go out-of-date, and it is
# used by including this in the head of the translated file:
#
# #use wml::debian::translation-check translation="X.xx"
#
# where X.xx is the current CVS revision number of the file you have
# translated.
#
# There are also some additional parameters that you can use on the #use
# line:
#
#    original="language"
# where  language  is the name of the language you are translating from, if
# not english. The name must correspond to the top-level subdirectory, and
# to the name in languages.wml
#
#    mindelta="number"
# which defines the maximum difference in CVS revisions before the
# translation is considered aged. The default value is 1. For less important
# pages, set it to 2, which means that not every change is considered making
# the translation aged. The value for the <aged/> tag is displayed.
#
#    maxdelta="number"
# which defines the maximum difference in CVS revisions before the
# translation is considered to be outdated (and the value of the <outdated/>
# tag is displayed). The default value is 5. For very important pages, set
# it to be less. A value of 1 means that every change is considered making
# the translation outdated.

# This is the message that is displayed if the translation is aged.
# (min_delta <= difference < max_delta)
<define-tag translationaged>
  <gettext><em>Note:</em> The <a href="$link">original document</a> is newer than this translation.</gettext>

# This is the message that is displayed if the translation is too old.
# (difference >= max_delta)
<define-tag translationoutofdate>
  <gettext>Warning! This translation is too out of date, please see the <a href="$link">original</a>.</gettext>

# This is the message that is displayed if the referenced original file
# no longer exists.
