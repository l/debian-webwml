# "events": need to add a list of events inside to block of standard

# "newcontributors": 3 vars (dd, dm, uploader) + if one of them ==0 just
# skip it
#
# "dsa": 3 tags (dsa, stable announce, bpo announce) each one with own
# list, inside 2 blocks of gettextized text + if one is not added just
# skip it

# here the only variable is the number (expressed in letters) of the issue, there's probably a
# smarter way to do it, but for now this one works.
# example:
# <intro issue="fourth" /> please remember that the the var issue is not
# localized so the translators needs to put it in directly in their
# language
