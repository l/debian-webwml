<h2 id="money_donations">Donations of money</h2>

<p>Debian is the name of the project, and Debian is how the
distribution we create is called. In order to handle money donations,
we set up a non-profit corporation,
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/">Software in the Public Interest</a>.</p>

<p>Although created by a volunteers throughout the world, Debian
has expenses that were, for a long time, paid for out of the
pockets of a few of the developers. These expenses include
registering the debian.org domain, cutting CD's for testing new
releases, unreimbursed travel and lodging expenses while appearing
at conferences, etc.</p>

<p>Many of the donations to date have been from appreciative users.
While all donations are welcome, it is especially hoped that any
businesses that make money through Debian (CD manufacturers,
support companies, or even businesses that rely on Debian
for day to day operations) will contribute a percentage
of their profit to help make Debian the best OS
it can be.</p>

<p>If you would like to make a monetary donation to Debian, see the
<a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=34115#DonationName_4">SPI donation page</a>.
Make sure to specify that the money is intended for Debian. Since SPI
is a non-profit organization we can issue receipts for tax purposes.</p>

<p>For some parts of the world it may be easier to make the donation to
one of the partner organizations of Software in the Public Interest
(check the <a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=34115#DonationName_4">SPI donation page</a>
for current information):</p>

<h2 id="equipment_donations">Donations of equipment and services</h2>

<p>Given the small budget Debian runs on it is not possible, at this time,
for Debian to purchase and maintain its own computers and network connections.
We therefore rely on the donation of equipment and services from companies and
universities to keep Debian connected to the world.</p>

<p>If your company has any idle machines or spare equipment (hard drives, SCSI
controllers, network cards, etc) lying around, please consider donating them to
Debian. Please contact our
<a href="mailto:hardware-donations@debian.org">hardware donations delegate</a>
for details.</p>

<p>Debian maintains a <a href="misc/hardware_wanted">list of hardware that is wanted</a> for various
services and groups within the project.</p>
