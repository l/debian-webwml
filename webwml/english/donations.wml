<P>Software in the Public Interest (a.k.a. Debian) is currently a
non-profit corporation under the laws of New York State.  We are in the
process of petitioning the IRS to grant us 501(c)3 tax-exempt
non-profit status.

<P>Although created by a volunteers throughout the world, Debian
has expenses that have, until now, been paid for out of the
pocket of a few of the developers. These expenses include
registering the debian.org domain, cutting CD's for testing new
releases, unreimbursed travel and lodging expenses while appearing
at conferences, etc.
It is hoped that annual donations will exceed the cost of these
expenses.

<P>Many of the donations to date have been from appreciative users.
While all donations are welcome, it especially hoped that any
businesses that make money through Debian (CD manufacturers,
support companies, or even businesses that rely on Debian
for day to day operations) will contribute a percentage
of their profit to help make Debian GNU/Linux the best OS
it can be. Unfortunately, donations are not tax-deductible
until we are granted 501(c)3 status by the IRS.

<P>To make a donation to make a check or money order out to:

<H2><A name="equipment_donations">Donations of equipment and services</A></H2>

<P>Given the small budget Debian runs on it is not possible, at this time,
for Debian to purchase and maintain it's own computers and network connections.
We therefore rely on the donation of equipment and services from companies and
universities to keep Debian connected to the world.

<P>If your company has any idle machines or spare equipment (hard drives, SCSI
controllers, network cards, etc) lying around, please consider donating them to
Debian. Contact the 
<A href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">&lt;webmaster@debian.org&gt;</A> for details.

equipment or services to Debian:
