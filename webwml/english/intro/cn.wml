<H1>Setting the Default Language</H1>

<P>Note: this page is not complete. If you have information on browser
configuration that isn't listed below, please send it to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.

<P>Obviously, not everyone in the world uses the same language. As the
web grows it is becoming more common to find pages that are available
in multiple languages. A standard was therefore introduced, called
content negotiation, that allows a person to set the language(s) they
prefer to receive documents in. The actual version delivered is negotiated
between your browser and the server; your browser sends its preferences
and the server decides which version to send based on your preferences,
how it is configured and what versions of the document are available.

<P>To set the default language in your browser you have to set a
variable that gets passed to the web server. How this is done depends
on the browser you are using.

<DL compact>
<DT><b>lynx</b>
<DD>You can either edit the preferred_language variable in your .lynxrc
or set it using the 'O' command while in lynx.
<DT><b>netscape 3.x</b>
<DD>???
<DT><b>netscape 4.x</b>
<DD>Use
<pre>
     Edit -> Preference...
then
     Navigator -> Languages
</pre>
Make sure you select the language from the choices. A number of people
reported problems because they typed in the language by hand.
<DT><b>IE</b>
<DD>???
</DL>

<H3>What should I set the variable to?</H3>

<P>This is written for those who have to fill in the value of the variable
by hand, for example lynx users. Netscape 4.x users should select from the
choices given.

<P>Since the original language of the Debian web pages is English and
not all documents may be translated into your preferred language, it
is a good idea to set you preferred language variable to allow English
as a backup. For example, if you are a native French speaker using
lynx, you would want the following line in your .lynxrc
<pre>
    preferred_language=fr; q=1.0, en; q=0.5
</pre>
This tells the server that you would like the French version of the
document if available, otherwise use the English one.

<P>For more information about setting the preferred_language variable see the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html">Apache
documentation on content negotiation</a>.
