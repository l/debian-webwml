#use wml::debian::template title="Setting the Default Language"

<P>Note: this page is not complete. If you have information on browser
configuration that isn't listed below, please send it to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.

<P>Obviously, not everyone in the world uses the same language. As the
web grows it is becoming more common to find pages that are available
in multiple languages. A standard was therefore introduced, called
content negotiation, that allows a person to set the language(s) they
prefer to receive documents in. The actual version delivered is negotiated
between your browser and the server; your browser sends its preferences
and the server decides which version to send based on your preferences,
how it is configured and what versions of the document are available.

<P>To set the default language in your browser you have to set a
variable that gets passed to the web server. How this is done depends
on the browser you are using.

<DL compact>
<DT><strong>lynx</strong>
<DD>You can either edit the <kbd>preferred_language</kbd> variable in your
<kbd>.lynxrc</kbd> or set it using the 'O' command while in lynx.
<DT><strong>netscape 3.x</strong>
<DD>Add
<pre>
     *httpAcceptLanguage: [preferred_language string]
</pre>
to the Netscape app-defaults file or <kbd>~/.Xresources</kbd>    
<DT><strong>netscape 4.x</strong>
<DD>Use
<pre>
     Edit -> Preferences -> Navigator -> Languages
</pre>
Make sure you select the language from the choices. A number of people
reported problems because they typed in the language by hand.
<DT><strong>W3</strong> (emacs based web browser)
<DD>
<pre>(setq url-mime-language-string  "preferred_language=fr; q=1.0, en; q=0.5")</pre>
or using the custom package (assuming URL version p4.0pre.14):
<pre>Hypermedia -> URL -> Mime -> Mime Language String...</pre>
<DT><strong>IE</strong>
<DD>
<pre>
     View -> Internet Options -> General/Languages
</pre>
<DT><strong>Opera</strong>
<DD>???
<DT><strong>iCab</strong>
<DD>
<pre>
     Edit -> Preferences -> Browser -> Fonts,Languages
</pre>
</DL>

<H3>What should I set the variable to?</H3>

<P>Since the original language of the Debian web pages is English and
not all documents may be translated into your preferred language, it
is a good idea to set your preferred language variable to allow English
as a backup. For example, if you are a native French speaker using
lynx, you would want the following line in your <kbd>.lynxrc</kbd>
<pre>
preferred_language=fr; q=1.0, en; q=0.5
</pre>
This tells the server that you would like the French version of the
document if available, otherwise use the English one.

<p>One thing you need to be careful of is using sub-categories of languages.
Using 'en-GB, fr', for example,  does not do what most people expect (if they have
not read the http specification).
A server that receives a request for a document with a preferred language of
'en-GB, fr' when both an 'en' and 'fr' version exist will serve the French one.
It will only serve the English document before the French one if there is
a version of the file with .en-gb for the language extension.
Thus, you should configure your browser to send 'en-GB, en, fr' or simply 'en, fr'.
It does work the other way though, e.g. a server can return en-us when en is requested.

<p><strong>We strongly recommend that you do not add country extensions to a language
unless you have good reason</strong>. If you do add one, make sure you also include
the language without the extension.

<P>For more information about setting the preferred_language variable see the

documentation on content negotiation</a>.
