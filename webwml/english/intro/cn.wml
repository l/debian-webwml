#use wml::debian::template title="Setting the Default Language"

<P>Note: this page is not complete. If you have information on browser
configuration that isn't listed below, please send it to
<a href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</a>.

<P>Obviously, not everyone in the world uses the same language. As the
web grows it is becoming more common to find pages that are available
in multiple languages. A standard was therefore introduced, called
content negotiation, that allows a person to set the language(s) they
prefer to receive documents in. The actual version delivered is negotiated
between your browser and the server; your browser sends its preferences
and the server decides which version to send based on your preferences,
how it is configured and what versions of the document are available.

<P>To set the default language in your browser you have to set a
variable that gets passed to the web server. How this is done depends
on the browser you are using.

<DL compact>
<DT><strong>lynx</strong>
<DD>You can either edit the <kbd>preferred_language</kbd> variable in your
<kbd>.lynxrc</kbd> or set it using the 'O' command while in lynx.
<DT><strong>netscape 3.x</strong>
<DD>Add
<pre>
     *httpAcceptLanguage: [preferred_language string]
</pre>
to the Netscape app-defaults file or <kbd>~/.Xresources</kbd>    
<DT><strong>netscape 4.x</strong>
<DD>Use
<pre>
     Edit -> Preferences -> Navigator -> Languages
</pre>
Make sure you select the language from the choices. A number of people
reported problems because they typed in the language by hand.
<DT><strong>W3</strong> (emacs based web browser)
<DD>
<pre>(setq url-mime-language-string  "preferred_language=fr; q=1.0, en; q=0.5")</pre>
or using the custom package (assuming URL version p4.0pre.14):
<pre>Hypermedia -> URL -> Mime -> Mime Language String...</pre>
<DT><strong>IE</strong>
<DD>
<pre>
     View -> Internet Options -> General/Languages
</pre>
<DT><strong>Opera</strong>
<DD>???
</DL>

<H3>What should I set the variable to?</H3>

<P>This is written for those who have to fill in the value of the variable
by hand, for example lynx users. Netscape 4.x users should select from the
choices given.

<P>Since the original language of the Debian web pages is English and
not all documents may be translated into your preferred language, it
is a good idea to set you preferred language variable to allow English
as a backup. For example, if you are a native French speaker using
lynx, you would want the following line in your <kbd>.lynxrc</kbd>
<pre>
preferred_language=fr; q=1.0, en; q=0.5
</pre>
This tells the server that you would like the French version of the
document if available, otherwise use the English one.

<P>For more information about setting the preferred_language variable see the
<a href="http://www.apache.org/docs/content-negotiation.html">Apache
documentation on content negotiation</a>.
