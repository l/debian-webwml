#use wml::debian::template title="Diversity Statement" BARETITLE="true"


<p>
The Debian Project welcomes and encourages participation by everyone.
</p>
<p>
No matter how you identify yourself or how others perceive you:
we welcome you.
We welcome contributions from everyone as long as they
interact constructively with our community.
</p>
<p>
While much of the work for our project is technical in nature, we 
value and encourage contributions from those with expertise in other areas,
and welcome them into our community.
