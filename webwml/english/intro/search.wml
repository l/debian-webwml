#use wml::debian::template title="Information on how to use the Debian search engine"

<P>The Debian search engine at <a href="http://search.debian.org/">http://search.debian.org/</A>
will allow for different types of searching, depending on what you would like
to do.

<H3>Simple Search</H3>
<P>The simplest way of all is to enter in a single word and hit return.  The
search engine will then return all pages on the website that have that word
in it.  A lot of the time this will be fine.

<P>The next level up is to search for more than one word.  You have a choice
of search for all words, which will return pages that have all the words you
typed, or for any words, which will return pages that have any of the words
you typed.

<h3>Boolean Search</H3>
<P>If a simple search is not enough, then boolean may do the job for you.
You have a choice of and, or, not and a combination of these three.

<P><B>&amp; - logical AND</B> will return results where both words are in
the page.  For example "gcc &amp; patch" will find any URLs have contain both
"gcc" and "patch".

<P><B>| - logical OR</B> will return results where either word is in the
page.  For example "gcc  | patch" will find any URLs that have either "gcc"
or "patch".

<P><B>~ - logical NOT</B> excludes a word from the results.  You will usually
use this with logical AND ( &amp; ) as it removes results from a list.
For example "gcc & ~patch" will find all URLs that contain "gcc" that do
not also contain "patch".  Asking for just "~patch" returns nothing
because you are asking for an empty list and then removing pages that
contain patch, which returns an empty list.

<P><B>() - grouping</B> adds even more complexity as you can now group
logical blocks together.  For example "(gcc | make) & ~patch" will find
all URLs that contain either "gcc" or "make" but do not contain "patch".
