#use wml::debian::template title="Information on how to use the Debian search engine"

<P>The Debian search engine at <a href="https://search.debian.org/">https://search.debian.org/</a>
will allow for different types of searching, depending on what you would like
to do.

<H3>Simple Search</H3>

<P>The simplest way of all is to enter a single word in the search box, and
hit enter (or click the <em>Search</em> button). The search engine will then
return all pages on the website that have that word in it. This will give
you good results quite often.

<P>The next level up is to search for more than one word.  You have a
choice:
<dl>
<dt><em>search for all words</em>
  <dd>which will return pages that have all the words you typed
<dt><em>search for any words</em>
  <dd>which will return pages that have any of the words you typed
</dl>

<H3>Boolean Search</H3>

<P>If a simple search is not enough, then
<a href="http://foldoc.org/boolean">Boolean</a>
may do the job for you. You have a choice of <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>,
<em>not</em> and a combination of these three.

<P><B>&amp; - logical AND</B> will return results where both words are in
the page.  For example "gcc &amp; patch" will find any URLs have contain both
"gcc" and "patch".

<P><B>| - logical OR</B> will return results where either word is in the
page.  For example "gcc | patch" will find any URLs that have either "gcc"
or "patch".

<P><B>~ - logical NOT</B> excludes a word from the results.  You will usually
use this with logical AND ( &amp; ) as it removes results from a list.
For example "gcc &amp; ~patch" will find all URLs that contain "gcc" that do
not also contain "patch".  Searching for just "~patch" will not return
anything because you were searching for nothing, which returns nothing, and
then removing pages that contain the word "patch" from the empty list, which
of course still returns nothing.

<P><B>() - grouping</B> adds even more complexity as you can now group
logical blocks together.  For example "(gcc | make) &amp; ~patch" will find
all URLs that contain either "gcc" or "make" but do not contain "patch".
