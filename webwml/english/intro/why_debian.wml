#use wml::debian::template title="Reasons to Choose Debian"

<P>Thank you for considering using Debian GNU/Linux to run your machine.
If you aren't quite convinced why you should try Debian, consider the following:

<UL>
<LI>It is maintained by its users. If something needs to be fixed or improved, we just
    do it.
<LI>Unparalleled support. Mail sent to the
    <A HREF="../support#mail_lists">mailing lists</A> often gets answers
    within 15 minutes (or
    less), for free, and by the people who developed it. Compare that to typical phone support:
    hours spent on the phone, for money, only to get someone who doesn't know the system well
    enough to even understand your question.
<LI>The best packaging system in the world. Tired of old files from software three
    versions old
    cluttering your system? Or installing a piece of software only to find it causes your
    system to crash because of software conflicts? Dpkg, Debian's packaging system, was
    created to take care of these issues for you.
<LI>Easy installation. If you have heard that Linux is difficult to install,
    then you haven't tried Debian lately. We are constantly improving the installation
    process and already have zero floppy installs. You can do the installation directly from
    DOS or a CD.
<LI>Incredible amounts of software. Debian comes with over 1500 different pieces of software.
    Every bit of it is free. If you have commercial software that runs under Linux,
    you can still use it - in fact, there may even be an installer in Debian that will
    automatically install and set up everything for you.
<LI>source-code.  If you are a software developer, you will appreciate the fact
    that there are hundreds of development tools and languages, plus millions of
    lines of source code in the base system.  All of the software in the main distribution
    meets the criteria of the 
    <A HREF="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)</A>.
    This means that you can freely use this code to study from, or to incorporate into new free
    software projects.  There are also plenty of tools and code suitable for use in proprietary
    projects.
<LI>Easy upgrades. Due to our packaging system, upgrading to a new version of Debian is a
    snap. Just run dselect and you can upgrade from a CD in a matter of minutes or point
    dselect at one of the over 75 Debian
    <A HREF="../misc/README.mirrors">mirrors</A> and upgrade over the net.
<LI>Bug tracking system. Debian's bug tracking system is publicly available. We don't
    try to hide the fact that software doesn't always work the way users want. Users
    can submit bug reports and are notified when and why the bug was closed. This system
    allows Debian to respond to problems quickly and honestly.
   
</UL>

<P>If you are not already a Linux user, you may also enjoy the following benefits:
<UL>
<LI>Stability. There are many cases of machines that run for over a year without rebooting.
    Even then, they are only rebooted due to a power failure or a hardware upgrade. Compare
    that to other systems that crash multiple times a day.
<LI>Fast and easy on memory. Other operating systems may be as fast in one or two areas, but
    being based on Linux, Debian is lean and mean. Windows software run from Linux using
    an emulator often runs FASTER from Linux than in the native environment.
<LI>Drivers for most hardware is written by Linux users, not the manufacturer. While this
    can mean delays before new hardware is supported and no support for some hardware,
    it enables support for hardware long after the manufacturer has stopped producing it
    or gone out of business. Experience has shown that Open Source drivers are usually
    much better than proprietary ones. 
<LI>Good system security. Windows95 has essentially no security. NT has shown itself to
    be very bad also. After years of development, Linux is becoming quite secure.
    Being based on Linux, Debian benefits from this. Also, Debian is very responsive
    to making sure that fixes to security problems get into the distribution quickly
    (usually having fixed packages uploaded within a few days).

    <BR>History has shown that 'security through obscurity' does not work. The availability
    of source code allows the security in Linux to be evaluated in an open setting which
    prevents poor security models from being implemented.
<LI>Security software. Unknown to many, anything sent over the net can be
    seen by any machine between you and the receiver. Debian has packages of the
    famous PGP software which allows mail to be sent privately between users.
    In addition, ssh allows you to create secure connections to other machines which
    have ssh installed.
    <BR><strong>Note:</strong> software using strong encryption may not be exported from 
    the US due to export restrictions. For this reason, this software is not part of
    the regular Debian distribution. It is available on many of the Debian sites
    outside the US though.
</UL>

<P>Of course, Debian is not perfect. There are four areas that are common causes of complaints:
<UL>
<LI>"<A HREF="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/dselect.beginner.html">Dselect</A> (the front end to Debian's packaging system) is confusing to learn". This is an active
    area of work. It is hoped that the new package manager, apt, will be ready before the
    release of Debian 2.1.<BR>
    <strong>Note:</strong> Apt, the replacement for dselect is getting rave reviews,
    No other Linux distribution has anything like it. It currently works well, and is
    waiting for the development of the front-end before being released.
<LI>"Lack of popular commercial software". It is quite true that popular software, such as
    Excel, is not available for Linux. Commercial software is coming out in greater numbers,
    though, as more companies discover the power of Linux and its largely untapped market with a
    rapidly growing user base (conservative estimates put the number of installations
    between 5-10 million as of Feb 1998). For example, Netscape and Sun's JDK
    are available for Linux. Lack of office suites should no longer be a problem as there
    are now a number available: <A href="http://www.applix.com">Applixware</A>,
    <A href="http://www.stardivision.com">StarOffice</A>
    and <A href="http://linux.corel.com/linux8/">WordPerfect8</A>
    (WordPerfect8 even has a PowerPoint replacement).
    For those interested in databases, Debian actually has a number of SQL
    database programs to choose from (mSQL, mySQL and postgreSQL).
<LI>"Linux is hard to configure". Note that this says configure, not install, as many people
    find the initial installation of Debian easier than Windows. A lot of hardware (printers
    for example)
    could be made easier to set up, though. Also, some software could have a script that would
    walk the user through the configuration (at least for the most common setups).
    This is an area that is being worked on.
<LI>Not all hardware is supported.  Particularly, really new, really old, or really rare
    hardware. Also hardware that is dependent on complex "driver" software that the
    manufacturer only supplies for Windows platforms (WinModems for example).
    However, in most cases, equivalent hardware is available that does work with Linux.
    Some hardware is not supported because the vendor chooses not to make the hardware
    specifications available. See the <A HREF="../OpenHardware/">Open Hardware Certification
    Program</A> for our answer to this problem .
</UL>

<P>If the above isn't enough to convince you to use Debian, consider the following:
low cost (as little as the cost of a phone call), easy installation,
and true multi-tasking that could easily double your productivity.
How can you afford not to try it?
