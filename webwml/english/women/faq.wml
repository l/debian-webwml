    <question>
        Why are there so few women in the computer field / F/OSS
    </question>
    <answer><p>
        There are a lot of theories about this, but no one can know for
        sure. However, Ellen Spertus has a wonderful paper,
        <a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/7040/?sequence=2">Why
        Are There So Few Female Computer Scientists?</a> that will explain
        some of the cultural phenomena that might be a cause. Also, please
        read Val Henson's

    <question>What's on topic for the mailing list?</question>
    <answer><p>
        If it pertains to women in Debian, it's probably on topic. That
        said, we're not trying to recreate
        <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/">debian-user</a>,
        <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-mentors/">debian-mentors</a>, or
        <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">debian-devel</a>. The list is primarily for discussing
        Debian Women related projects and collaboration.

    <question>How do I get on IRC?</question>
    <answer><p>
        For people that have never been on IRC before, you should first
        install an IRC client. Popular Linux clients available in Debian are
        <a href="http://www.hexchat.org/">X-Chat</a>, <a href="http://www.pidgin.im">Pidgin</a> and
        <a href="http://irssi.org/">irssi</a>. Once installed, connect
        to irc.debian.org and /join #debian-women. For more general IRC
        information, read the
        <a href="http://www.irchelp.org/irchelp/faq.html">IRC FAQ</a>.
