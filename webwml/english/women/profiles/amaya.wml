            Evangelizing: I was in a way responsible for the Spanish

    <question4>
    <answer><p>
        I must confess I was encouraged by the guys... Santiago Vila and
        Héctor García. I never thought I'd be up to it until they showed an
        interest to sponsor me.

    <question5>
    <answer><p>
        Be yourself. Take it with a grain of salt. Stay focused on your
        goals. Debian is a great community. I wouldn't want to give anyone
        a hard time. I enjoy being a DD a lot. It's a fulfilling
        experience. Go for it.

        It's something I have always wanted to do. I started a women
        oriented mailing list for the Spanish speaking some years ago. It
        was a huge failure ;-( Nowadays I am involved with:
            <a href="http://www.systers.org/">Systers</a>; 
                Women and Free Software (Spanish local effort).
                (Mujeresred-softwarelibre)
    </p></answer>

    <question7>
    <answer><p>
        I was supposed to be an English teacher. Or a technical translator.
        Free Software gave me a chance to change my destiny, grow up as a
        person, find new goals and motivations.
