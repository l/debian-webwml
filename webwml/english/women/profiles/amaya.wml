    <question4>
    <answer>
        I must confess I was encouraged by the guys... Santiago Vila and

        interest to sponsor me.

    <question5>
    <answer>
        Be yourself. Take it with a grain of salt. Stay focused on your
        goals. Debian is a great community. I wouldn't want to give anyone
        a hard time. I enjoy being a DD a lot. It's a fulfilling
        experience. Go for it.

            <a href="http://www.systers.org/">Systers</a>; 
                Women and Free Software (Spanish local effort).

    <question7>
    <answer>
        I was supposed to be an English teacher. Or a technical translator.

        person, find new goals and motivations.
