    <answer>
        I must confess I was encouraged by the guys... Santiago Vila and

        interest to sponsor me.

    <question5>
    <answer>
        Be yourself. Take it with a grain of salt. Stay focused on your
        goals. Debian is a great community. I wouldn't want to give anyone
        a hard time. I enjoy being a DD a lot. It's a fulfilling
        experience. Go for it.

        It's something I have always wanted to do. I started a women

        was a huge failure ;-( Nowadays I am involved with:

            <li>

        </ul>
    </answer>

    <question7>
    <answer>
        I was supposed to be an English teacher. Or a technical translator.
        Free Software gave me a chance to change my destiny, grow up as a
        person, find new goals and motivations.
