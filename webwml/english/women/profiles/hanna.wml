    <question2>
    <answer><p>
        Not yet; I plan to enter the New Maintainer process within the next
        couple of months, however.

    <question3>
    <answer><p>
    My primary contribution to the Debian project is packaging. I
    currently co-maintain one package and have just filed an ITP (Intent
    to Package) for another.<br /> I also take an active role in
    couraging others to use Debian. I believe that one of the most
    important ways to support the growth of a project like Debian is to
    encourage people to find out more and, if interested, get involved.
    Over the past few years, I have initiated both formal and informal
    discussions about Debian with a variety of individuals, and helped
    run several Debian installfests.

    <question4>
    <answer><p>
    Debian has one of the most active and interesting developer
    communities of any Linux distribution - it was this that originally
    drew me to the project.

    <question5>
    <answer><p>
    Think about what you'd like to contribute to Debian, and what
    you hope to gain from your involvement. On a more practical level,
    help fix bugs, take over orphaned packages, check the <a
    href="https://www.debian.org/devel/wnpp/">WNPP</a> (Work-Needing and
    Prospective Packages) regularly, and do read the <a
    href="https://lists.debian.org/">Debian mailing lists</a> - they're
    all a great way to learn more about the Debian community and
    ethos.
    </p></answer>

    <question6>
    <answer><p>
    I'm part of the <a
    href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/women/">Women@CL</a> project, a
    Cambridge-based initiative that provides local, national and
    international activities for women engaged in computing research and
    academic leadership. I'm also a member of <a
    href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cisters/">CISters</a>, an informal
    group of graduate women in the University of Pennsylvania's
    Department of Computer and Information Science.
    </p></answer>

    <question7>
    <answer><p>
    I got my BA from the University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory, after transferring into the Computer Science Tripos from
    Engineering during my second year. Since then, I've completed an MSc
    at the University of Edinburgh, where I specialised in neural
    computing and learning from data, and have started a PhD in
    Cambridge's Inference Group. When not working on my PhD, I spend an
    inordinate amount of time drinking coffee, playing with computers,
    contributing to the Debian project, and updating my <a
    href="http://join-the-dots.org/">blog</a>.
