    <question1>
    <answer>
    I started collecting first Linux experiences somewhen
    in the mid to late 90s, when a friend of mine put Linux on his 
    machine and showed me what it could do. I was quite 
    fascinated but couldn't try it out myself since I didn't have 
    a computer of my own (computers used to be classical boys toys 
    at that time) and fiddling with the family 486 was a total 
    no-go. When I started studying at the university in 2001 I finally 
    bought the first computer of my own. Working on the University's 
    Unix terminals quickly got me hooked on *nixes. From 2001 
    to 2004 I on and off tried several different distributions 
    (Mandrake, RedHat, Gentoo, even Solaris x86), but none of them 
    fully convinced me. In 2004 I finally switched to Debian and 
    have never looked back since then.

    <question3>
    <answer>
    I maintain packages and am one of currently three delegated Debian
    Press Officers.
    Besides my press work I do a lot of travelling to represent Debian at
    all kinds of Linux and Free Software events, usually by
    staffing/organising Debian booths and giving talks on all things
    Debian and Free Software related.
    I am, by now, also somewhat of a Debian Women veteran :).

    <question4>
    <answer>
    I tried a few other Unix and Linux distributions before I
    finally ended up with Debian. After using it for some time I decided
    that I liked the project so much that I wanted to be a part of it. I
    started of by reading and writing on mailing lists and irc and then
    got more and more involved until I finally applied for a developer
    account myself.

    <question5>
    <answer>
    Don't be shy. Don't give up after the first failure, nor after the
    second or third. Debian and the people in it sometimes need some time
    to get acquainted with, but it's definitely worth it! I guess the
    best is to find a niche that fits your interests and begin working
    there, getting more and more involved in the whole project as times
    goes on.

    I am subscribed to several mailing lists at <a
    href="http://www.technixen.net/">technixen.net</a>, a German
    platform for women in different areas of computing.  Also I am a <a
    href="http://www.cybermentor.de/">Cyber Mentor</a> and have by now
    acquired something like a reputation for giving <q>Non-Dogmatic Women

    <question7>
    <answer>
    I've got my Master's Degree (<q>Magister</q>) in Information Sciences
    and work as Project Manager at an embedded Linux company.
    In my spare time I like crafting and all sort of DIY activities.
    I read a lot (mostly SF), like to listen to music (mostly ska, punk
    and blues), love to travel and always enjoy meeting
    fellow Debianists at the places I travel to.
