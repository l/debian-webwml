    <question3>
    <answer><p>
            These days I host the Debian dinner for the San Francisco Bay Area
Debian (bad.debian.net) group every other month where we chat about
Debian, sign keys and welcome traveling Debian contributors who
frequently attend our dinners. I also pitch in with the Debian News
team here and there, sharing links when I come across them and since
attending DebConf14 in Portland have started to also pitch in with
summary writing and editorial review.

As a bit of background, I got started with working on Debian with
Debian packaging in 2006 when I was working for a company that was
using a number of Debian packages internally for some of our
applications. In that role I was also able to work with a Debian
Developer on staff to get a couple tools into the Debian archive. I
also spent some time working on PHP Pear packages. I've since shifted
focus in my day job so it's been some time since I've been involved
with packaging, though I'd love to get back into it.

    <question4>
    <answer><p>
I love contributing to open source software, so it was pretty natural
for me to be interested in learning about packaging after I'd been
using Debian on my home computers for a couple years. As I mentioned,
it was actually a paying job that finally got me to do packaging,
since we were using the packages in our infrastructure at work.

My relation to the news team started because I'm the editor for the
Ubuntu Weekly Newsletter, I routinely come across Debian-related
articles when looking for Ubuntu ones, so it made sense for me to
start sharing those.

Dive in, ask questions and don't get discouraged. Debian is
complicated, and there are lots of ways to do things, so it's easy
even for the smartest people to get lost. There are lots of teams
inside of Debian for whatever you may be interested in, and most of
them are eager to get new contributors so they're happy to help you
out. You're also welcome to ask folks on the Debian Women mailing list
and IRC channel, there are plenty of helpful folks there who can point
you in the right direction.

I spent several years working with the Ubuntu Women project
(ubuntu-women.org), which seeks to get more women involved with and
using Ubuntu.

    <question7>
    <answer><p>
My day job is a Systems Administrator working on the fully open source
infrastructure that OpenStack developers use, it's really exciting to
blend my passion for open source with my skills as a sysadmin. The
OpenStack project uses a large Continuous Integration (CI) system, so
I'm very interested in keeping an eye on what the Debian project does
with CI work moving forward.

I also am on the board of directors for Partimus.org, a non-profit
which puts Linux-based desktops into schools in need.
