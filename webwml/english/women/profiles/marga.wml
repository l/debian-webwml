    <question1>
    <answer><p>
    I started using Debian around 2000.  At first I was just a
    simple user, but with time I grew more involved, first reporting 
    bugs, then submitting patches, and by 2004 I started maintaining 
    packages.

    Yes. I became a Debian Developer on November 13th, 2005.

    <question3>
    <answer><p>
    I maintain some packages but not too many, I particularly
    enjoy doing QA: I've done quite a lot of NMUs to fix RC bugs in
    packages that were not fit for a release.<br/>Also, I've been very
    actively involved in the organization of several DebConfs,
    particularly for DebConf8, which took place in my country,
    Argentina.

    <question4>
    <answer><p>
    The free software philosophy. I liked that it was developed
    by a community instead of a company, and that my contributions
    could be accepted if they were worth.<br /><br /> Also, the magic
    of apt-get and the immense repository. I usually have this
    perception that if something is not in Debian, it's not worth using
    it.
    </p></answer>

    <question5>
    <answer><p>
    Look at the list of bugs and try to find the fix for one.
    There are lots of easy ones.
