    <question1>
    <answer><p>
    I've been using Debian since 2000. At first I was just a 
    simple user, but with time I grew more involved, first reporting 
    bugs, then submitting patches, and by 2004 I started maintaining 
    packages.
    <br /><br /> 
    A turning point in my life was the 
    <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf4">DebConf4</a> in Brazil, 
    where I was able to meet a lot of Debian Developers, 
    put faces to names and learn a lot about how Debian works. 
    I highly recommend that people attend DebConf and meet people 
    there. It's been a long time, and by this time I have the feeling 
    that Debian people are part of my extended family.

    Yes. I became a Debian Developer on November 13th, 2005.

    <question3>
    <answer><p>
    I maintain some packages but not too many, the biggest thing 
    regarding packaging that I do is participate in the team that 
    maintains the Cinnamon Desktop Environment.
    <br /><br /> 
    Also, I've been very actively involved in the organization of 
    several DebConfs, particularly for 
    <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebConf8">DebConf8, 
    which took place in my country, Argentina. 
    Later on I moved to Germany and also took an active part 
    of the organization of DebConf15, in Heidelberg. 
    On top of this, I particularly enjoy doing QA: 
    I've done quite a lot of NMUs to fix RC bugs in packages 
    that were not fit for a release, and I usually have a lot of fun 
    participating on Bug Squashing Parties. I am part of the 
    anti-harassment team, trying to make Debian a safe place where 
    everyone is welcome and can express themselves. 
    I am also part of the Technical Committee, which is the body 
    that helps make difficult technical decisions.

    <question4>
    <answer><p>
    The free software philosophy. I liked that it was developed
    by a community instead of a company, and that my contributions
    could be accepted if they were worthy.<br /><br /> Also, the magic
    of apt-get and the immense repository. I usually have this
    perception that if something is not in Debian, it's not worth using
    it (and if it is, then I can make it my responsibility to make sure 
    that it's packaged and uploaded). What has kept me interested 
    in working in Debian over the years is that there's always 
    more work to be done, more software to get into Debian, 
    more bugs to fix, more new ideas to try out. 
    </p></answer>

    <question5>
    <answer><p>
    There are many things to do in Debian, and usually the hardest part 
    is to find where you will fit. For example, if you are into 
    programming, look for a team that maintains packages in a 
    programming language that you like and join them. 
    If you are like me and like to fix many small bugs, 
    look at the list of bugs and try to find the fix for one. 
    There are lots of easy ones, and people will be really grateful 
    that you took the time to fix the bugs. But even if you are not 
    into code or bug fixing, there are many things to do. 
    We need better graphical design, we need better documentation, 
    we need translations, and many many more things.

    <question7>
    # A bit more about you...
    <answer><p>
    I've been mostly a Python Programmer for more than 10 years. 
    I lived in Argentina until 2012, and then moved to Munich, Germany 
    to work for Google as a Site Reliabilty Engineer.
    <br /><br /> 
    I've been married to Maximiliano Curia (another DD) since 2004 
    (DebConf4 was our honeymoon trip!)
