    <question1>
    <answer>
    For some years now: I started using Potato. It has only
    become my main system for the last year and a half or so,
    anyway.
    </answer>

    <question2>
    <answer>
    No, not yet, but I maintain some packages for Debian. I'd
    like to enter NM process as soon as I can.
    </answer>

    <question3>
    <answer>
    Mainly packaging, writing some documentation and
    translating a few things. I'm also quite involved in teaching other
    people how to package things for Debian and trying to get more
    girls into the Free Software World.

    <question4>
    <answer>
    It's not the first time I have given a bit of my time to a
    Free Software Project, but I've never been as involved in one as I
    am in Debian. What I value the most is the freeness of the project
    as well as the community around it. I think that the most important
    part of Debian is its social side, both in its development and in
    its goals.

    <question5>
    <answer>
    First of all, enjoy what you do, or do things you enjoy.
    Second, don't let anyone scare you, Debian is a big community in
    which most of the people are very nice and kind, even though there
    might be some trolls around sometime. You'll have to learn a lot
    and go through a bunch of documents, so be patient, Rome wasn't
    built in a day. If you ever have doubts, just ask. Finally, if your
    English is not so good, try to improve it as much as you can. At
    the moment English is the main language in which Debian is
    developed.
    </answer>

    <question6>
    <answer>
    Yes, I've joined some other groups like LinuxChix, Systers
    or ChicasLinux, and I'm very involved in a new group we're creating
    called Alixa.
    </answer>

    <question7>    
    <answer>
    I'm a Spanish girl who's always, since I was very little,
    has been interested in computers and technology. I also like
    reading a lot, my favourite books are "Momo" by Michael Ende (yes,
    the author of "The Neverending Story") and "The Little Prince" by
    Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry. Apart from that I like a lot being with
    my friends, travelling and learning things.
