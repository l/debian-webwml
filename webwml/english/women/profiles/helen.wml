    <question1> 
    <answer>
    Since about 2000. I'm not exactly sure - it seems like a long time
    ago. My housemate foisted Debian on me for his own amusement, and
    it grew from there...

    <answer>
    Yes.

    <question3>
    <answer>
	I'm packaging several useful and/or funny KDE panel applets
	as well as a little thing I wrote myself (kdoomsday) and labplot
	(a great scientific plotter). I may take on a couple of others
	soon.
	I'm active on the Debian Women mailing list. I'm interested
	in seeing Debian become a community that is more varied and more
	accessible to groups that are currently under-represented.

     <question4>
     <answer>
     Mainly I'm really interested in how it all works. I enjoy
     learning how to package things, how the system is put together, etc.
     And I like volunteer work.

     Just do it. It's not as scary as you might think. Get into
     the Debian Women mailing list and ask people, read the information
     on the website, join us on IRC. There are a lot of friendly and
     helpful people about.

     <question6>
     <answer>
     Nope.

     <question7>
     <answer>
     I'm a physicist with an interest in technology and
     programming. When I'm not being those things I'm into music,
     sailing, dogs and whatever takes my interest at the time. I've done
     volunteer stuff in all of those areas and others. In my experience
     you get back more than you put in, if you are prepared to take time
     to help other people out in a way that you enjoy.<br /><br />

     I like the ideals of the free/open-source software movement, not to
     mention the excellent software you get to use! I would like to see
     more women involved in that world, and Debian specifically, because
     I know women have a lot to contribute.
