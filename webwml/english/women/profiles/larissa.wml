    <question1>
    # How long have you been using Debian?
    <answer>
    I had my first contact with Free Software and open source philosophy when I got into University in 2009. Thankfully, a few years before, some of my seniors advocated the use of only open source software in our department laboratories, despite ongoing resistance from other students and some staff. Debian was their distro of choice in our University labs, but I was using Ubuntu from 2009 until 2012, when I finally changed to Debian. I've been using Debian exclusively ever since :-)
