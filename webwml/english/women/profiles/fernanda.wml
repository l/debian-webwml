    <question5>
    <answer>
    Do not be intimidated is the first advice, but mainly, have people
    know about your work and do not let anyone diminish it. Something
    I've been noticing since I started working with women groups inside
    the Free Software community is that many women are there taking part,
    but just a small number of them expose their ideas. Give priority to
    that. having an opinion, even if it is not the brightest, is better
    than having none or hiding it so nobody knows about it. Any idea is a
    bright idea when people around you get to know it.

    Software Livre Mulheres). We work on projects to increase digital
    inclusion of women, assist feminist NGO's and social groups with
    understanding and using Free Software.

    <question7>
    <answer>
    I work for IBM as a developer at their Linux Technology Center
    installed at UNICAMP, a university of the State of São Paulo. I
    became involved with Free Software in 1997. I still haven't finished
    university, although I've started two university courses, already:
    mathematics, and computer science, but I'm planning to start (and
    finish, this time) a technology-related course real soon
    now.
