    I contribute to <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/AppArmor">AppArmor</a> in Debian and have completed an internship with the <a href="http://outreachy.org/">Outreachy</a> program in 2014.

Furthermore, I am involved with packaging privacy related software through the pkg-privacy-tools packaging team (pkg-otr-team & pkg-anonymity-tools team). In the past, I also helped working on Debian related webpages, like the <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/">security tracker</a>.

    <question5>
    # Do you have any tips for women interested in getting more involved with Debian?
    <answer>
    You do not need to be afraid of not being good enough! People at Debian are keen to help getting you started if you can tell them what you are interested in and what you already know.
	Many things are well documented, but you still need to find them. The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org">Debian wiki</a> is a great place to start.

    In the past I've been teaching women how to take apart computers and put them back together, which is a method I learned from the <a href="http://genderchangers.org/">Genderchangers</a>, but I am not involved with any women in technology group.

    # A bit more about you...
