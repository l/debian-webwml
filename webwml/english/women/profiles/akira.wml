    <answer>
    I was born in Venezuela but I came to Germany to do my bachelor in Biochemistry and Cell Biology. After my bachelor I went to Lund University in Sweden to do my Masters in Bioinformatics. Currently I am back in Germany to do the practical work for my master thesis. During my time in Sweden I took a course on Perl programming as part of my masters. I also know a bit of Python and JavaScript.
