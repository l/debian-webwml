#use wml::debian::template title="About Debian Women"


<p>
    The Debian Women project was founded in May 2004.  We seek to balance
    and diversify the Debian Project by actively engaging with interested
    women and encouraging them to become more involved with Debian.  We will
    promote women's involvement in Debian by increasing the visibility of
    active women, providing mentoring and role models, and creating
    opportunities for collaboration with new and current members of the
    Debian Project.  We welcome the involvement of all people who are
    interested in increasing the participation of women in Debian.
