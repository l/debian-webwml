<h2>Trademark Licensing Policy</h2>
<p><em>Debian</em> is registered trademark of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/about-spi/trademarks">Software in the Public
Interest, Inc.</a> and managed by the Debian project. 

<p>The trademark was <a
href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=75386376">registered</a>
the 21st of December of 1999 but has been in use since August 1993. It is
registered under the Nice Class 009: "Computer Utility and Operating
System Software".

<p>The current policy was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-1998/msg00006.html">announced</a> by
Bruce Perens, Debian Project Leader, in 1998:</p>

<p><q>We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the "Debian" trademark.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian GNU/Linux distribution, you can
call that product "Debian". If you want to use the name in some other way, you
should ask us <b>first</b>.</q></p>

<p><q>To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no business use the name
"Debian" in the name of the business, or a domain name of the business.</q></p>

<h3>Work in Progress</h3>

<p>As <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2003/10/msg00003.html">announced</a>

as SPI resolution <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/resolutions/2003-06-03-bmh.1">2003-06-03-bmh.1</a>, a Trademark Committee was started
to review SPI's trademark policy. This committee can be contacted at

different one drafted by 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProposedTrademarkPolicy">Branden Robinson</a>.
