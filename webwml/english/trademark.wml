<h2>Trademark Licensing Policy</h2>

<p>Debian is committed to protect and ensure consistent usage of its trademark,
logos, and styles and also make it easier for every <em>bonafide</em> user to
use. As a part of this process, the Debian trademark is a registered United
States trademark of <a
href="http://www.spi-inc.org/corporate/trademarks/">Software in the Public
Interest, Inc.</a>, managed by the Debian project. For <em>registration outside
the United States</em>, we have filed a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_system">Madrid Protocol</a>
application to extend the protection in the European Union, China and
Japan; the Debian trademark is also registered
<a href="http://pesquisa.inpi.gov.br/MarcaPatente/jsp/servimg/servimg.jsp?BasePesquisa=Marcas">in Brazil</a>,
N. do processo 827045310.</p>

<p>The Debian trademark was first <a
href="http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=75386376">registered</a>
the 21st of December of 1999, but has been in use since August 1993. It is
registered under the Nice Class 009: <q>Computer Utility and Operating System
Software</q>.</p>

<p>The current policy governing usage of the Debian trademark was <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce/debian-announce-1998/msg00006.html">announced</a>
by Bruce Perens, Debian Project Leader, in 1998, and has been subsequently
updated as follows:</p>

<p>Debian's trademarks, service marks, logos, slogans and styles (<q>Debian
trademarks</q>) are valuable assets that we need to protect.
We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the Debian trademarks.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian distribution, you can
call that product <q>Debian</q>. If you want to use the name in some other way, you
should ask us <strong>first</strong>.
<br />
To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no one other than the Debian
project uses Debian trademarks in the name of the business, organization or
domain name.</p>

<p>For inquiries about the Debian trademarks, please contact
<email "trademark@debian.org">. To request usage of Debian trademarks for
purposes other than those allowed by the Debian trademark policy, please mail

<h3>Work in Progress</h3>

<p>As <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2011/08/msg00003.html">announced</a>
by Stefano Zacchiroli, Debian Project Leader, in August 2011, the current
Debian Trademark Policy is being reviewed, in collaboration with SPI and <a
href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org">SFLC</a>.</p>

<p>Previous drafts of a new trademark policy, by <a
href="http://wiki.mako.cc/TrademarkFreedom">Benjamin Mako Hill</a> and <a
href="http://wiki.debian.org/ProposedTrademarkPolicy">Branden Robinson</a> are
available and are being used as basis for the forthcoming policy.</p>
