slogans, styles. This policy encompasses all marks, in word and logo form,
collectively referred to as <q>Debian trademarks</q>. You can see a
non-exhaustive list of Debian trademarks, including both registered and
unregistered (but otherwise legally recognized) trademarks at our
<a href="#trademarks">trademarks page</a>.</p>

<p>The objective of this trademark policy is:</p>

<ol>
  <li>to encourage widespread use and adoption of the Debian trademarks,</li>
  <li>to clarify proper usage of Debian trademarks by third parties,</li>
  <li>to prevent misuse of Debian trademarks that can confuse or mislead users
    with respect to Debian or its affiliates.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please note that it is not the goal of this policy to limit commercial
activity around Debian. We encourage businesses to work on Debian while being
compliant with this policy.</p>

<p>Following are the guidelines for the proper use of Debian trademarks by
publishers and other third parties. Any use of or reference to Debian
trademarks that is inconsistent with these guidelines, or other unauthorized
use of or reference to Debian trademarks, or use of marks that are confusingly
similar to Debian trademarks, is prohibited and may violate Debian trademark
rights.</p>

<p>Any use of Debian trademarks in a misleading and false manner or in a manner
that disparages Debian, such as untruthful advertising, is always
prohibited.</p>
