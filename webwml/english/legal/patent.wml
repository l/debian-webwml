<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This document describes Debian's policy on patents. Debian recognizes the
threat that patents pose to Free Software, and continues to work with others in
the Free Software community on patent defense.</p>

<p>This policy intends to provide clear and useful guidance for community
members confronted with patent issues, so that the Debian community can
coordinate its patent defense free from fear, uncertainty, and doubt.</p>


<h1>Policy Statement</h1>

<ol>

<li><p>Debian will not knowingly distribute software encumbered by patents;
    Debian contributors should not package or distribute software they know to
    infringe a patent.</p></li>

<li><p>Debian will not accept a patent license that is inconsistent with
    the <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Debian Social Contract</a>
    or <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
    Guidelines</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Unless communications related to patents are subject to attorney-client
    privilege, community members may be forced to produce them in a lawsuit.
    Also, patent concerns expressed publicly may turn out to be unfounded but
    create a good deal of fear, uncertainty, and doubt in the meantime.
    Therefore, please refrain from posting patent concerns publicly or
    discussing patents outside of communication with legal counsel, where they
    are subject to attorney-client privilege.</p></li>

<li><p>Patent risks affect the entire community. If you are concerned about a
    specific patent, please do not keep it to yourself &mdash; notify legal
    counsel.</p></li>

<li><p>All communication related to specific patent risk should be directed to
    <a href="mailto:patents@debian.org">patents@debian.org</a>, which is
    maintained under the rules of attorney-client privilege. The risk will be
    evaluated and any necessary response will be made directly to affected
    parties.</p></li>

</ol>
