<p>This site presents the opinion of the Debian project on how
certain licenses meet the standards set by the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG). Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">\
debian-legal mailing list</a>, which you may
<a href="mailto:debian-legal@lists.debian.org">contact</a> if you
have questions or comments about these license summaries.</p>

<p>Licenses are normally classified into three categories. There
are <em>free</em> licenses, <em>non-free</em> licenses and
licenses that <em>don't allow redistribution</em>.</p>

<p><em>Free</em> licenses meet all requirements defined by
the DFSG. For help with interpreting the DFSG, you should
check the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">DFSG FAQ</a>
that answers some common questions about licenses and how to classify
them. To be licensed under a free license is a necessary (but not
sufficient, see
<a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-main">Debian Poilcy,
section 2.2.1</a>) criteria for a piece of software to be included in Debian.
Examples of free licenses are the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">\
Artistic license</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/misc/bsd.license">\
BSD style licenses</a>. 

<p><em>Non-Free</em> licenses fail one or more criteria set by the
DFSG. They do allow however at least the unlimited non-commercial
redistribution of the licensed software.  Debian provides
infrastructure for certain non-free packages. Although not part of
the Debian system, these packages are provided as a benefit to our
users (see §5 of our <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>).
Examples are licenses that restrict commercial use of the software or
licenses that make restrictions on modifications.</p>

<p><em>Non-redistributable</em> licenses in addition to being
non-free, also don't allow unlimited non-commercial redistribution.
This category also includes licenses that are silent regarding rights
of redistribution. In other words, if the license does not
specifically grant the right to redistribute, the assumption is that
no rights are granted.  Debian does not support non-redistributable
software and the licenses do not grant permission for distribution
needed by the Debian mirror network.</p>

<p>Similar lists are maintained by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF) and the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">Open Source
Initiative</a> (OSI). Please note however, that the Debian project
uses different criteria to judge the categorization of licenses,
as shown in the following lists.</p>

<p>We provide three lists that differ in how they are sorted:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="bydate">chronological list</a>, sorted
            by the date of the summary.</li>
          <li><a href="byname">alphabetical list</a>, sorted
            by the name of the license.</li>
          <li><a href="byclass">classification list</a>,
            sorted alphabetically within each classification.
            You can go directly to the lists of
            <a href="byclass#free">free</a>, <a href="byclass#non-free">\
              non-free</a> and
            <a href="byclass#non-dist">non-redistributable</a> licenses.
        </ul>
