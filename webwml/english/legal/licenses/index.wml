<p>This page presents the opinion of some debian-legal contributors on how
certain licenses follow the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG).  Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">\
debian-legal mailing list</a> in response to questions from
potential package maintainers or licensors.  We welcome
enquiries from maintainers considering particular licenses, but
we encourage most maintainers to use one of the common licenses:
GPL, LGPL, modified BSD, or Artistic.</p>

<p>Software packaged for Debian is normally classified into one of four
categories.  There is free software (main), non-free software
(non-free), free software which depends on some non-free
software (contrib) and software which cannot be redistributed
(not included).
<a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/ch-archive.html">Debian Policy section 2</a>
explains exactly how the DFSG
are applied to the archive.  If in doubt, maintainers are
asked to email debian-legal about licenses, including the text
of any new license into the body of the email.
You may find it helpful to
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/search.html">search the list archives</a>
for the name of the license before emailing lists with questions
about it.  If you still email questions, please link to some of
the previous relevant discussions.</p>

<p>debian-legal is advisory. The actual decision-makers are the
ftpmasters and the package maintainers.  However, if one cannot
convince most of the generally liberal debian-legal contributors,
it's probably not clear that the software follows the DFSG.</p>

<p>Because the actual decision-makers are the
ftpmasters and the package maintainers, it is a very good idea
to check
<a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/REJECT-FAQ.html">the ftpmasters REJECT FAQ</a>
and search site:packages.debian.org for any license that you doubt,
to look for other examples of its handling for debian.
(The search works because package copyright files are published on
packages.debian.org as plain text.)</p>

<p>Other lists are maintained by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF) and the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">Open Source
Initiative</a> (OSI).  Please note however, that
the Debian project decides on particular packages rather than
licenses in abstract, and the lists are general explanations. It
is possible to have a package containing software under a
"free" license with some other aspect that makes it non-free.
Sometimes, debian-legal comments on a license in abstract, not
applied to any particular software.  While these discussion
can suggest possible problems, often no firm answers can be
reached until some specific software is examined.</p>

<p>You may contact debian-legal if you have questions or comments
about these summaries.</p>

that answers some common questions about the DFSG and how to analyse
software.</p>
