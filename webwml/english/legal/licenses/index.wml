<p>This site presents the opinion of debian-legal contributors on how
certain licenses follow the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG).  Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">\
debian-legal mailing list</a> in response to questions from
potential package maintainers or licensors.  We welcome
enquiries from maintainers considering particular licenses, but
we encourage most maintainers to use one of the common licenses:
GPL, LGPL, BSD or Artistic.</p>

<p>Software packaged for debian is normally classified into four
categories.  There is free software (main), non-free software
(non-free), free software which depends on some non-free
software (contrib) and software which cannot be redistributed
(not included).
<a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/ch-archive.html">Debian Policy section 2</a>
explains exactly how the DFSG
are applied to the archive.  If in doubt, maintainers are
asked to email debian-legal about licenses, including the text
of any new license into the body of the email.</p>

<p>debian-legal is advisory. The actual decision-makers are the
ftpmasters and the package maintainers.  However, if one cannot
convince most of the generally liberal debian-legal contributors,
it's probably not clear that the software follows the DFSG.</p>

<p>Lists are maintained by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF) and the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">Open Source
Initiative</a> (OSI).  Please note however, that
the Debian project decides on particular packages rather than
licenses in abstract, and the lists are general explanations. It
is possible to have a package containing software under a
"free" license with some other aspect that makes it non-free.
Sometimes, debian-legal comments on a license in abstract, not
applied to any particular software.  While these discussion
can suggest possible problems, often no firm answers can be
reached until some specific software is examined.</p>

<p>You may contact debian-legal if you have questions or comments
about these summaries.</p>

<h2>Work in Progress</h2>

<p>For help with interpreting the DFSG, you should check the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq">DFSG FAQ</a>
that answers some common questions about the DFSG and how to analyse
software.</p>

<p>Manoj Srivasta has drafted
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~srivasta/Position_Statement">a
position statement about the FDL</a>
which is yet to be voted upon.</p>

<p>Evan Prodromu has been delegated to work with Creative Commons
to resolve DFSG-related problems with some of their licenses, as
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~evan/ccsummary">summarised
on Evan's page</a> and
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2005/04/msg00031.html">reported
