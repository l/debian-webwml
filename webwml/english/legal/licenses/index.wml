<p>This site presents the opinion of debian-legal contributors on how
certain licenses follow the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG). Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">\
debian-legal mailing list</a> in response to questions from
potential package maintainers or licence users. You may
<a href="mailto:debian-legal@lists.debian.org">contact debian-legal</a> if you
have questions or comments about these summaries.</p>

<p>Note that this site was started in May 2004 and old summaries
are slowly integrated. Please excuse any inconsistencies and
gaps appearing in the first weeks.</p>

<p>Software packaged for debian is normally classified into three categories.
There is <em>free</em> software, <em>non-free</em> software and
software under licenses that <em>don't allow redistribution</em>.
The final decision rests with the ftpmasters,
but they have many other responsibilities,
so any consensus on debian-legal is usually considered.</p>

<p><em>Free</em> software is licensed in a way that follows
the DFSG. For help with interpreting the DFSG, you should
check the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">DFSG FAQ</a>
that answers some common questions about the DFSG and how to analyse
software. To be licensed under a suitable license is a necessary (but not
sufficient, see
<a href="$(DOC)/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-main">Debian Policy,
section 2.2.1</a>) criteria for a piece of software to be included in Debian.
Examples of suitable licenses are the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">\
Artistic license</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/misc/bsd.license">\
BSD style licenses</a>. 

<p>Software in <em>non-free</em> has licenses that fail to follow one or
more of the DFSG, but do allow at least the unlimited non-commercial
redistribution of the licensed software.  Debian provides
infrastructure for some non-free packages. Although not part of
the Debian system, these packages are provided as a benefit to our
users (see §5 of our <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>).
Examples are software under licenses that restrict commercial use of the
software or licenses that make restrictions on modifications.</p>

<p><em>Non-redistributable</em> software is
non-free, but also doesn't allow unlimited non-commercial redistribution.
This category also includes software under licenses that are silent
regarding rights of redistribution. In other words, if the license does not
specifically grant the right to redistribute, the assumption is that
no rights are granted.  Debian does not support non-redistributable
software and the licenses do not grant permission for distribution
needed by the Debian mirror network.</p>

<p>Similar lists are maintained by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF) and the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">Open Source
Initiative</a> (OSI). Please note however, that the Debian project
decides on particular packages rather than licences in abstract,
and the following are just general explanations when possible.
It is possible to have a package containing software under one of
these licences with some other aspect that makes it non-free.</p>

<p>We provide three lists that differ in how they are sorted:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="bydate">chronological list</a>, sorted
            by the date of the summary.</li>
          <li><a href="byname">alphabetical list</a>, sorted
            by the name of the license.</li>
          <li><a href="byclass">classification list</a>,
            sorted alphabetically within each classification.
            You can go directly to the lists of
            <a href="byclass#free">free</a>, <a href="byclass#non-free">\
              non-free</a> and
            <a href="byclass#non-dist">non-redistributable</a> licenses.
        </ul>
