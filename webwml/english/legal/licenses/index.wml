<p>These site presents the opinion of the Debian project on how
certain licenses meet the standards set by the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> (DFSG). Most of these opinions were formed in
discussions on the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/">\
debian-legal mailing list</a>. If you have questions or comments
about one of these license summaries, please contact the list.</p>

<p>Licenses are normally classified into three categories. There
are <em>free</em> licenses, <em>non-free</em> licenses and
licenses that <em>don't allow redistribution</em>.</p>

<p><em>Free</em> licenses do fulfill all requirements defined by
the DFSG. If you're in doubt how to interpret the DFSG, you should
check the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">DFSG FAQ</a>
that answers some common questions about licenses and how to classify
them. To be licensed under a free license is a necessary (but not
sufficent) criteria for a piece of software to be included in Debian.
Examples for free licenses are the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public
License</a>, the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/artistic-license.php">\
Artistic license</a> and <a href="$(HOME)/misc/bsd.license">\
BSD style licenses</a>. 

<p><em>Non-Free</em> licenses fail one or more criteria set by the
DFSG. They do allow however at least the unlimited non-commercial
redistribution of the licensed software. Examples are licenses
that restrict commercial use of the software or licenses that
make restrictions on modifications.</p>

<p>We make a difference betweem non-free licenses and licenses
that <em>don't allow unlimited non-commercial redistribution</em>
because we sometimes distribute non-free software through our
mirrors if this serves our users
(see §5 of our <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">Social Contract</a>),
even if it can't be a part of the Debian distribution. Some licenses
doesn't even allow this, so we put them in an extra category.</p>

<p>Similar lists are maintained by the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html">Free Software
Foundation</a> (FSF) and the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/index.html">Open Source
Initiative</a> (OSI).</a>

<p>We provide three lists that differ in how they are sorted:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><a href="bydate">chronological ordered list</a>, sorted
            after the date of the summary.</li>
          <li><a href="byname">alphabetical ordered list</a>, sorted
            by the name of the license.</li>
          <li><a href="byclass">list ordered after classification</a>,
            alphabetical lists of the licenses, sorted by their
            classification.<br/>
            You can go directly to the lists of
            <a href="byclass#free">free</a>, <a href="byclass#non-free">\
              non-free</a> and
            <a href="byclass#non-dist">non-redistributable</a> licenses.</p>
        </ul>
