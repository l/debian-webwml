<ul>
<li>It appears (though it's slightly unclear) that credit to original
  author(s) must be as prominently displayed, and in the same location, 
  as credit to any other author.  This restricts modification (DFSG
  §3).</li>

<li>When any Licensor asks, all references to their name(s) must be purged
  from the work.  This restricts modification (DFSG §3).</li>

<li><p>Use of the "Creative Commons" trademark (or related trademark or logo)
  appears to be a license violation, and thus grounds for a copyright
  holder to revoke the license.  This violates the
  <a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">"Tentacles of Evil"</a>
  test and can remove all freedoms the license grants.</p>

  <p>This references the trademark notice on the license's website
    where it is not obvious if this notice is part of the license.</p>
