<define-tag justification>
<ul>
<li>It requires the original publisher and author to appear on all outer
  surfaces of a paper copy, and defines how they should appear.  This is
  a significant restriction on modification (DFSG §3).</li>

<li>The person who makes any modifications must be identified.  According
  to the Dissident Test this is an unacceptable restriction on
  modification (DFSG §3).  (See the
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">DFSG FAQ</a> for
  a description of the Dissident Test.)</li>

<li>A reference to the original, unmodified version must be included in
  any modified versions.  This may not be known or available, and may be
  impossible under certain circumstances (e.g., the document is included
  as help text in a binary).  This is an unacceptable restriction on
  modification (DFSG §3).</li>
