<define-tag short-summary>Restricts modification, unreasonable termination clause</define-tag>

<define-tag justification>
<ul>
<li>Item #5 "External Deployment" places distribution-like burdens on
  deployment.  E.g., when the Work is made available for use over a
  network source must be distributed.  This is a use restriction.  While
  the DFSG does not explicitly prohibit this, the consensus on
  debian-legal is that this is non-free.</li>

<li>Item #9 "Acceptance and Termination" requires the licensee to
  acknowledge acceptance of the license.  According to the
  <a href="http://people.debian.org/~bap/dfsg-faq.html">Dissident
  Test</a> this is a significant restriction on distribution (DFSG §1)</li>

<li>Item #6 "Attribution Rights" requires retention of any "Attribution 
  Notice," even if false.  There are no restrictions on what may be
  considered an attribution notice, so there are no clear limits on what
  materials must be retained.  This restricts modification (DFSG §3).</li>

<li>Item #10 "Termination for Patent Action" terminates the license if you
  are involved in a suit with a licensor over "a patent applicable to
  software", or against anyone else over a patent relating to the Work.
  This clause is much too broad, and restricts all the freedoms that the
  license provides.</li>
</ul>
