<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Kaminsky discovered that libspf2, an implementation of the Sender
Policy Framework (SPF) used by mail servers for mail filtering, handles
malformed TXT records incorrectly, leading to a buffer overflow
condition (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2469">CVE-2008-2469</a>).</p>

<p>Note that the SPF configuration template in Debian's Exim configuration
recommends to use libmail-spf-query-perl, which does not suffer from
this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5.dfsg-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libspf2 package.</p>
