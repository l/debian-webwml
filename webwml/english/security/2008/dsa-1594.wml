<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Cornelius discovered two buffer overflows in Imlib's - a powerful
image loading and rendering library - image loaders for PNM and XPM
images, which may result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0.0debian1-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 package.</p>
