<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Postfix, a mail transfer agent,
incorrectly checks the ownership of a mailbox. In some configurations,
this allows for appending data to arbitrary files as root.</p>

<p>Note that only specific configurations are vulnerable; the default
Debian installation is not affected. Only a configuration meeting
the following requirements is vulnerable:</p>
<ul>
 <li> The mail delivery style is mailbox, with the Postfix built-in
   local(8) or virtual(8) delivery agents.</li>
 <li> The mail spool directory (/var/spool/mail) is user-writeable.</li>
 <li> The user can create hardlinks pointing to root-owned symlinks
   located in other directories.</li>
</ul>

<p>For a detailed treating of the issue, please refer to the upstream
<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.mail.postfix.announce/110">author's announcement</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.8-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2-2lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postfix package.</p>
