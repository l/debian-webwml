<p>Drew Yao discovered that libTIFF, a library for handling the Tagged Image
File Format, is vulnerable to a programming error allowing malformed
tiff files to lead to a crash or execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.2-7+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.2-10+lenny1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff package.</p>
