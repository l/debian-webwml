<p>The SNMP agent (snmp_agent.c) in net-snmp before 5.4.1 allows remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption)
via a GETBULK request with a large max-repeaters value.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.3-7etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable and testing distributions (sid and lenny,
respectively), this problem has been fixed in version 5.4.1~dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp package.</p>
