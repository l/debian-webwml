<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered several local
vulnerabilities in xwine, a graphical user interface for the WINE emulator.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0930">CVE-2008-0930</a>
  <p>The xwine command makes unsafe use of local temporary files when
  printing.  This could allow the removal of arbitrary files belonging
  to users who invoke the program.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0931">CVE-2008-0931</a>
  <p>The xwine command changes the permissions of the global WINE configuration
  file such that it is world-writable.  This could allow local users to edit
  it such that arbitrary commands could be executed whenever any local user
  executed a program under WINE.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.1-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xwine package.</p>
