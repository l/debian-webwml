<p>Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in xpdf, a set of tools for
display and conversion of Portable Document Format (PDF) files.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problem:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1693">CVE-2008-1693</a>

    <p>Xpdf's handling of embedded fonts lacks sufficient validation
    and type checking.  If a maliciously-crafted PDF file is opened, 
    the vulnerability may allow the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of the user running xpdf.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.01-9.1+etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems were fixed in
version 3.02-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf package.</p>
