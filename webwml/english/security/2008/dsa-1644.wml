<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Felipe Andres Manzano discovered that mplayer, a multimedia player, is
vulnerable to several integer overflows in the Real video stream
demuxing code.  These flaws could allow an attacker to cause a denial
of service (a crash) or potentially execution of arbitrary code by
supplying a maliciously crafted video file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0~rc1-12etch5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0~rc2-18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer packages.</p>
