<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xine, a
media player library, allowed for a denial of service or arbitrary code
execution, which could be exploited through viewing malicious content.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1246">CVE-2007-1246</a> / <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1387">CVE-2007-1387</a>

    <p>The DMO_VideoDecoder_Open function does not set the biSize before use in a
    memcpy, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a buffer overflow
    and possibly execute arbitrary code (applies to sarge only).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0073">CVE-2008-0073</a>

    <p>Array index error in the sdpplin_parse function allows remote RTSP servers
    to execute arbitrary code via a large streamid SDP parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0486">CVE-2008-0486</a>

    <p>Array index vulnerability in libmpdemux/demux_audio.c might allow remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted FLAC tag, which triggers
    a buffer overflow (applies to etch only).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1161">CVE-2008-1161</a>

    <p>Buffer overflow in the Matroska demuxer allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a Matroska
    file with invalid frame sizes.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.1.2+dfsg-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.11-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib package.</p>
