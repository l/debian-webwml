<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that phpGedView, an application to provide online access
to genealogical data, performed insufficient input sanitising on some
parameters, making it vulnerable to cross site scripting.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
phpgedview (4.0.2.dfsg-3)</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
4.1.e+4.1.1-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpgedview (4.0.2.dfsg-3) package.</p>
