<define-tag description>insecure temp file handling</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the "to-upgrade" plugin of Feta,
a simpler interface to APT, dpkg, and other Debian package tools
creates temporary files insecurely, which may lead to local denial
of service through symlink attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.16+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your feta package.</p>
