<define-tag description>null pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
Oriol Carreras discovered that syslog-ng, a next generation logging
daemon can be tricked into dereferencing a NULL pointer through
malformed timestamps, which can lead to denial of service and the
disguise of an subsequent attack, which would otherwise be logged.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.6-1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your syslog-ng package.
