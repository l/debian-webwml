<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Howells discovered that policyd-weight, a policy daemon for the Postfix
mail transport agent, created its socket in an insecure way, which may be
exploited to overwrite or remove arbitary files from the local system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.1.14-beta-6etch2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain a policyd-weight package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your policyd-weight package.</p>
