<p>Damian Put discovered a vulnerability in the ClamAV anti-virus
toolkit's parsing of Petite-packed Win32 executables.  The weakness
leads to an invalid memory access, and could enable an attacker to
crash clamav by supplying a maliciously crafted Petite-compressed
binary for scanning.  In some configurations, such as when clamav
is used in combination with mail servers, this could cause a system
to "fail open," facilitating a follow-on viral attack.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
weakness as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2713">CVE-2008-2713</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.90.1dfsg-3etch13.<p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), the problem has been fixed in version
0.93.1.dfsg-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
