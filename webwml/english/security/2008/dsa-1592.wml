<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1673">CVE-2008-1673</a>

    <p>Wei Wang from McAfee reported a potential heap overflow in the
    ASN.1 decode code that is used by the SNMP NAT and CIFS
    subsystem. Exploitation of this issue may lead to arbitrary code
    execution. This issue is not believed to be exploitable with the
    pre-built kernel images provided by Debian, but it might be an
    issue for custom images built from the Debian-provided source
    package.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2358">CVE-2008-2358</a>

    <p>Brandon Edwards of McAfee Avert labs discovered an issue in the
    DCCP subsystem. Due to missing feature length checks it is possible
    to cause an overflow that may result in remote arbitrary code
    execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-18etch6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>
