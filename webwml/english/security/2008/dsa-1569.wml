<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Cacti, a systems and services monitoring frontend,
performed insufficient input sanitising, leading to cross site scripting
and SQL injection being possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6i-3.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7b-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.</p>
