<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Luigi Auriemma, Alin Rad Pop, R&eacute;mi Denis-Courmont, Quovodis, Guido
Landi, Felipe Manzano, Anibal Sacco and others discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in vlc, an application for playback and streaming of
audio and video.  In the worst case, these weaknesses permit a remote,
unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges
of the user running vlc.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following eight problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6681">CVE-2007-6681</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow vulnerability in subtitle handling allows an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code through the opening of a
    maliciously crafted MicroDVD, SSA or Vplayer file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6682">CVE-2007-6682</a>

    <p>A format string vulnerability in the HTTP-based remote control
    facility of the vlc application allows a remote, unauthenticated
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6683">CVE-2007-6683</a>

    <p>Insecure argument validation allows a remote attacker to overwrite
    arbitrary files writable by the user running vlc, if a maliciously
    crafted M3U playlist or MP3 audio file is opened.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0295">CVE-2008-0295</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0296">CVE-2008-0296</a>

    <p>Heap buffer overflows in RTSP stream and session description
    protocol (SDP) handling allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
    code if a maliciously crafted RTSP stream is played.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0073">CVE-2008-0073</a>

    <p>Insufficient integer bounds checking in SDP handling allows the
    execution of arbitrary code through a maliciously crafted SDP
    stream ID parameter in an RTSP stream.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0984">CVE-2008-0984</a>

    <p>Insufficient integrity checking in the MP4 demuxer allows a remote
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary memory and execute arbitrary code
    if a maliciously crafted MP4 file is opened.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1489">CVE-2008-1489</a>

    <p>An integer overflow vulnerability in MP4 handling allows a remote
    attacker to cause a heap buffer overflow, inducing a crash and
    possibly the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously crafted
    MP4 file is opened.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-svn20061012.debian-5.1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6.e-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
