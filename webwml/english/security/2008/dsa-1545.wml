<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that an integer overflow in rsync's code
for handling extended attributes may lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.9-2etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rsync package.</p>
