<p>Christian Schmid and Meder Kydyraliev (Google Security) discovered a
number of vulnerabilities in exiftags, a utility for extracting EXIF
metadata from JPEG images. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identified the following three problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6354">CVE-2007-6354</a>

    <p>Inadequate EXIF property validation could lead to invalid memory
    accesses if executed on a maliciously crafted image, potentially
    including heap corruption and the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6355">CVE-2007-6355</a>

    <p>Flawed data validation could lead to integer overflows, causing
    other invalid memory accesses, also with the potential for memory
    corruption or arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6356">CVE-2007-6356</a>

    <p>Cyclical EXIF image file directory (IFD) references could cause
    a denial of service (infinite loop).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.98-1.1+0sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.98-1.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.01-0.1.</p>
