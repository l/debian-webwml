<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered that Evolution, the e-mail and groupware suite,
had a format string vulnerability in the parsing of encrypted mail messages.
If the user opened a specially crafted email message, code execution was
possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.3-6etch2.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-2sarge3. Some architectures have not yet completed building
the updated package for sarge, they will be added as they come available.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.3-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your evolution package.</p>
