<p>It was discovered that malformed cache update replies against the Squid
WWW proxy cache could lead to the exhaustion of system memory, resulting
in potential denial of service.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), the update cannot currently
be processed on the buildd security network due to a bug in the archive
management script. This will be resolved soon. An update for i386
is temporarily available at at http://people.debian.org/~jmm/squid/.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.5-6etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.</p>
