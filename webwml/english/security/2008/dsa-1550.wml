<p>It was discovered that suphp, an Apache module to run PHP scripts with
owner permissions handles symlinks insecurely, which may lead to
privilege escalation by local users.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.2-1+etch0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your suphp packages.</p>
