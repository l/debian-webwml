<p>It was discovered that poppler, a PDF rendering library, did not 
properly handle embedded fonts in PDF files, allowing attackers to
execute arbitrary code via a crafted font object.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.4.5-5.1etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler package.</p>
