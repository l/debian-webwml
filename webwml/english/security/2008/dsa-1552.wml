<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the MPlayer movie player performs insufficient
input sanitising on SDP session data, leading to potential execution
of arbitrary code through a malformed multimedia stream.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in 
version 1.0~rc1-12etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0~rc2-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer package.</p>
