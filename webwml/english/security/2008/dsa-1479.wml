<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2878">CVE-2007-2878</a>

    <p>Bart Oldeman reported a denial of service (DoS) issue in the VFAT
    filesystem that allows local users to corrupt a kernel structure resulting
    in a system crash. This is only an issue for systems which make use
    of the VFAT compat ioctl interface, such as systems running an 'amd64'
    flavor kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4571">CVE-2007-4571</a>

    <p>Takashi Iwai supplied a fix for a memory leak in the snd_page_alloc module.
    Local users could exploit this issue to obtain sensitive information from
    the kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6151">CVE-2007-6151</a>

    <p>ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0001">CVE-2008-0001</a>

    <p>Bill Roman of Datalight noticed a coding error in the linux VFS subsystem
    that, under certain conditions, can allow local users to remove
    directories for which they should not have removal privileges.</p></li> 

</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-17etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
