<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may
lead to a denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6712">CVE-2007-6712</a>

    <p>Johannes Bauer discovered an integer overflow condition in the hrtimer
    subsystem on 64-bit systems. This can be exploited by local users to
    trigger a denial of service (DoS) by causing the kernel to execute an
    infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1615">CVE-2008-1615</a>

    <p>Jan Kratochvil reported a local denial of service condition that
    permits local users on systems running the amd64 flavor kernel
    to cause a system crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2136">CVE-2008-2136</a>

    <p>Paul Harks discovered a memory leak in the Simple Internet Transition
    (SIT) code used for IPv6 over IPv4 tunnels. This can be exploited
    by remote users to cause a denial of service condition.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2137">CVE-2008-2137</a>

    <p>David Miller and Jan Lieskovsky discovered issues with the virtual
    address range checking of mmaped regions on the sparc architecture
    that may be exploited by local users to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-18etch5.</p>

<p>Builds for linux-2.6/s390 and fai-kernels/powerpc were not yet available at
the time of this advisory. This advisory will be updated as these builds
become available.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>
