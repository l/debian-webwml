<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Roundup, an issue tracking system, fails to properly escape HTML input,
allowing an attacker to inject client-side code (typically JavaScript)
into a document that may be viewed in the victim's browser.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.1-5+etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundup packages.</p>
