<define-tag description>Several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in cupsys, the
Common Unix Printing System.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0047">CVE-2008-0047</a>
<p>
Heap-based buffer overflow in CUPS, when printer sharing is enabled,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted search
expressions.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0882">CVE-2008-0882</a>
<p>
Double free vulnerability in the process_browse_data function in CUPS
1.3.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) and possibly the execution of arbitrary code via crafted packets to the
cupsd port (631/udp), related to an unspecified manipulation of a
remote printer.
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4etch3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.</p>
