<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the regex module in Smarty, a PHP templating engine,
allows attackers to call arbitrary PHP functions via templates using the
regex_replace plugin by a specially crafted search string.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.14-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.9-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.18-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smarty package.</p>
