<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in git-core, the core of
the git distributed revision control system.  Improper path length
limitations in git's diff and grep functions, in combination with
maliciously crafted repositories or changes, could enable a stack
buffer overflow and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
vulnerability as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3546">CVE-2008-3546</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4.4-2.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.6.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git-core packages.</p>
