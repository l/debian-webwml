<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5823">CVE-2006-5823</a>

    <p>LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6054">CVE-2006-6054</a>

    <p>LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6058">CVE-2006-6058</a>

    <p>LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users
    with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a
    specially crafted corrupt filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-7203">CVE-2006-7203</a>

    <p>OpenVZ Linux kernel team reported an issue in the smbfs filesystem which
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (oops) during mount.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1353">CVE-2007-1353</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2172">CVE-2007-2172</a>

    <p>Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2525">CVE-2007-2525</a>

    <p>Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3105">CVE-2007-3105</a>

    <p>The PaX Team discovered a potential buffer overflow in the random number
    generator which may permit local users to cause a denial of service or
    gain additional privileges. This issue is not believed to effect default
    Debian installations where only root has sufficient privileges to exploit
    it.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3739">CVE-2007-3739</a>

    <p>Adam Litke reported a potential local denial of service (oops) on
    powerpc platforms resulting from unchecked VMA expansion into address
    space reserved for hugetlb pages.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3740">CVE-2007-3740</a>

    <p>Steve French reported that CIFS filesystems with CAP_UNIX enabled 
    were not honoring a process' umask which may lead to unintentionally
    relaxed permissions.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3848">CVE-2007-3848</a>

    <p>Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4133">CVE-2007-4133</a>

    <p>Hugh Dickins discovered a potential local DoS (panic) in hugetlbfs.
    A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree may allow
    local users to trigger a BUG_ON() call in exit_mmap.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4308">CVE-2007-4308</a>

    <p>Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4573">CVE-2007-4573</a>

    <p>Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited
    by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems.
    This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers
    during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant
    to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run
    the amd64 linux-image flavour.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5093">CVE-2007-5093</a>

    <p>Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6063">CVE-2007-6063</a>

    <p>Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6151">CVE-2007-6151</a>

    <p>ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6206">CVE-2007-6206</a>

    <p>Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6694">CVE-2007-6694</a>

    <p>Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0007">CVE-2008-0007</a>

    <p>Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
