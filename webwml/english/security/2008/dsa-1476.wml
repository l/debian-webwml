<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that the PulseAudio sound server performed
insufficent checks when dropping privileges, which could lead to local
privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain pulseaudio.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5-5etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pulseaudio packages.</p>
