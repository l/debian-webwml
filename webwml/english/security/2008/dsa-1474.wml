<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Meder Kydyraliev discovered an integer overflow in the thumbnail
handling of libexif, the EXIF/IPTC metadata manipulation library, which
could result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain exiv2 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-1.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exiv2 packages.</p>
