<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libnet-dns-perl.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<p>It was discovered that libnet-dns-perl generates very weak transaction
IDs when sending queries (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3377">CVE-2007-3377</a>).  This update switches
transaction ID generation to the Perl random generator, making
prediction attacks more difficult.</p>

<p>Compression loops in domain names resulted in an infinite loop in the
domain name expander written in Perl (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3409">CVE-2007-3409</a>).  The Debian
package uses an expander written in C by default, but this vulnerability
has been addressed nevertheless.</p>

<p>Decoding malformed A records could lead to a crash (via an uncaught
Perl exception) of certain applications using libnet-dns-perl
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6341">CVE-2007-6341</a>).</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.48-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.59-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libnet-dns-perl package.</p>
