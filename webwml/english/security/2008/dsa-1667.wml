<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2315">CVE-2008-2315</a>

    <p>David Remahl discovered several integer overflows in the
    stringobject, unicodeobject,  bufferobject, longobject,
    tupleobject, stropmodule, gcmodule, and mmapmodule modules.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3142">CVE-2008-3142</a>

    <p>Justin Ferguson discovered that incorrect memory allocation in
    the unicode_resize() function can lead to buffer overflows.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3143">CVE-2008-3143</a>
 
    <p>Several integer overflows were discovered in various Python core
    modules.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3144">CVE-2008-3144</a>

    <p>Several integer overflows were discovered in the PyOS_vsnprintf()

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python2.4 packages.</p>
