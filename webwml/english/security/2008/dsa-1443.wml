<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>
It was discovered that several buffer overflows in tcpreen, a tool for
monitoring a TCP connection may lead to denial of service.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tcpreen.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-0.1etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-0.3.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your tcpreen package.
