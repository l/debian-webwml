<p>
Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:
</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3278">CVE-2007-3278</a>

    <p>
    It was discovered that the DBLink module performed insufficient
    credential validation. This issue is also tracked as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6601">CVE-2007-6601</a>,
    since the initial upstream fix was incomplete.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4769">CVE-2007-4769</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that a bug in the handling
    of back-references inside the regular expressions engine could lead
    to an out of bounds read, resulting in a crash. This constitutes only
    a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL processes
    regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4772">CVE-2007-4772</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular
    expression could be tricked into an infinite loop, resulting in denial
    of service. This constitutes only a security problem if an application
    using PostgreSQL processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6067">CVE-2007-6067</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular
    expression could be tricked massive resource consumption. This
    constitutes only a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL
    processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6600">CVE-2007-6600</a>

    <p>
    Functions in index expressions could lead to privilege escalation. For
    a more in depth explanation please see the upstream announce available
    at <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.905">http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.905</a>.
    </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge), doesn't contain postgresql-8.1.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
postgresql-8.1 8.1.11-0etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.2.6-1 of postgresql-8.2.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.1 (8.1.11-0etch1) package.
