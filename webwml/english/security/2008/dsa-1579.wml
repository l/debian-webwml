<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitizing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in the GIF reader implementation in
netpbm-free, a suite of image manipulation utilities.  Insufficient
input data validation could allow a maliciously-crafted GIF file
to overrun a stack buffer, potentially permitting the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:10.0-11.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems were fixed in
version 2:10.0-11.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm packages.</p>
