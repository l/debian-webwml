<define-tag description>buffer overflow, stack consumption</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Moritz Jodeit discovered that ClamAV, an anti-virus solution, suffers
from an off-by-one-error in its VBA project file processing, leading to
a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code execution
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5050">CVE-2008-5050</a>).</p>

<p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that ClamAV contains a denial of service
condition in its JPEG file processing because it does not limit the
recursion depth when processing JPEG thumbnails (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5314">CVE-2008-5314</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.1dfsg-4etch16.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.94.dfsg.2-1.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (lenny) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
