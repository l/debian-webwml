<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-lib, a library
which supplies most of the application functionality of the xine
multimedia player.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following three problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1482">CVE-2008-1482</a>

    <p>Integer overflow vulnerabilities exist in xine's FLV, QuickTime,
    RealMedia, MVE and CAK demuxers, as well as the EBML parser used
    by the Matroska demuxer.  These weaknesses allow an attacker to
    overflow heap buffers and potentially execute arbitrary code by
    supplying a maliciously crafted file of those types.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1686">CVE-2008-1686</a>

    <p>Insufficient input validation in the Speex implementation used
    by this version of xine enables an invalid array access and the
    execution of arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    Speex file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1878">CVE-2008-1878</a>

    <p>Inadequate bounds checking in the NES Sound Format (NSF) demuxer
    enables a stack buffer overflow and the execution of arbitrary
    code through a maliciously crafted NSF file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.12-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.</p>
