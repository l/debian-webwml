<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin,
an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1924">CVE-2008-1924</a>

    <p>Attackers with CREATE table permissions were allowed to read
    arbitrary files readable by the webserver via a crafted
    HTTP POST request.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1567">CVE-2008-1567</a>

    <p>The PHP session data file stored the username and password of
    a logged in user, which in some setups can be read by a local
    user.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1149">CVE-2008-1149</a>

    <p>Cross site scripting and SQL injection were possible by attackers
    that had permission to create cookies in the same cookie domain
    as phpMyAdmin runs in.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.11.5.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
