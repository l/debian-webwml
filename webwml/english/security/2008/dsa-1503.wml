<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2731">CVE-2004-2731</a>

    <p>infamous41md reported multiple integer overflows in the Sbus PROM
    driver that would allow for a DoS (Denial of Service) attack by a
    local user, and possibly the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4814">CVE-2006-4814</a>

    function caused by improper lock handling.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5753">CVE-2006-5753</a>

    <p>Eric Sandeen provided a fix for a local memory corruption vulnerability
    resulting from a misinterpretation of return values when operating on
    inodes which have been marked bad.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5823">CVE-2006-5823</a>

    <p>LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted cramfs filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6053">CVE-2006-6053</a>

    <p>LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext3 filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6054">CVE-2006-6054</a>

    <p>LMH reported a potential local DoS which could be exploited by a malicious
    user with the privileges to mount and read a corrupted ext2 filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6106">CVE-2006-6106</a>

    <p>Marcel Holtman discovered multiple buffer overflows in the Bluetooth
    subsystem which can be used to trigger a remote DoS (crash) and potentially
    execute arbitray code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1353">CVE-2007-1353</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1592">CVE-2007-1592</a>

    <p>Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2172">CVE-2007-2172</a>

    <p>Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2525">CVE-2007-2525</a>

    <p>Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3848">CVE-2007-3848</a>

    <p>Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4308">CVE-2007-4308</a>

    <p>Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4311">CVE-2007-4311</a>

    <p>PaX team discovered an issue in the random driver where a defect in the
    reseeding code leads to a reduction in entropy.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5093">CVE-2007-5093</a>

    <p>Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.
    
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6063">CVE-2007-6063</a></p>

    <p>Venustech AD-LAB discovered a a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6151">CVE-2007-6151</a>

    <p>ADLAB discovered a possible memory overrun in the ISDN subsystem that
    may permit a local user to overwrite kernel memory leading by issuing
    ioctls with unterminated data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6206">CVE-2007-6206</a>

    <p>Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6694">CVE-2007-6694</a>

    <p>Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0007">CVE-2008-0007</a>

    <p>Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
