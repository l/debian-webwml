<p>Felipe Sateler discovered that apt-listchanges, a package change history
notification tool, used unsafe paths when importing its python libraries.
This could allow the execution of arbitary shell commands if the root user
executed the command in a directory which other local users may write
to.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.72.5etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem was not present.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.82.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt-listchanges package.</p>
