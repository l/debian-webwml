<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Anders Kaseorg discovered that afuse, an automounting file system
in user-space, did not properly escape meta characters in paths.
This allowed a local attacker with read access to the filesystem to
execute commands as the owner of the filesystem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.1-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your afuse (0.1.1-1+etch1) package.</p>
