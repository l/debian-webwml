<p>Christian Herzog discovered that within the Linux Terminal Server Project,
it was possible to connect to X on any LTSP client from any host on the
network, making client windows and keystrokes visible to that host.</p>

<p>NOTE: most ldm installs are likely to be in a chroot environment exported
over NFS, and will not be upgraded merely by upgrading the server itself.
For example, on the i386 architecture, to upgrade ldm will likely require:</p>

<pre>    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get update
    chroot /opt/ltsp/i386 apt-get dist-upgrade</pre>


<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99debian11+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:0.1~bzr20080308-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldm package.</p>
