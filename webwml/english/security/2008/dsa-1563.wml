<p>Joel R. Voss discovered that the IAX2 module of Asterisk, a free
software PBX and telephony toolkit performs insufficient validation of
IAX2 protocol messages, which may lead to denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.13~dfsg-2etch4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.19.1~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
