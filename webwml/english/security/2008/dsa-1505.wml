<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Takashi Iwai supplied a fix for a memory leak in the snd_page_alloc module.
Local users could exploit this issue to obtain sensitive information from
the kernel (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4571">CVE-2007-4571</a>).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-7sarge1. The prebuilt modules provided by alsa-modules-i386
have been rebuilt to take advantage of this update, and are available in
version 1.0.8+2sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.13-5etch1. This issue was already fixed for the version
of ALSA provided by linux-2.6 in DSA 1479.</p>

<p>For the unstable distributions (sid), this problem was fixed in version
1.0.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your alsa-driver and alsa-modules-i386
packages.</p>
