<p>Colin Walters discovered that the dbus_signature_validate function in 
dbus, a simple interprocess messaging system, is prone to a denial of 
service attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in 
version 1.0.2-1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid) 
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dbus package.</p>
