<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Duncan Gilmore discovered that yarssr, an RSS aggregator and reader,
performs insufficient input sanitising, which could result in the
execution of arbitrary shell commands if a malformed feed is read.</p>

<p>Due to a technical limitation of the archive management scripts, the
fix for the old stable distribution (sarge) needs to be postponed
by a few days.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your yarssr packages.</p>
