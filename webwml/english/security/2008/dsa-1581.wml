<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNUTLS, an
implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol suite.</p>

<p>NOTE: The libgnutls13 package, which provides the GNUTLS library, does
not contain logic to automatically restart potentially affected
services.  You must restart affected services manually (mainly Exim,
using "/etc/init.d/exim4 restart") after applying the update, to make
the changes fully effective.  Alternatively, you can reboot the system.</p>

<p>The following vulnerabilities have been identified:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1948">CVE-2008-1948</a>

    <p>A pre-authentication heap overflow involving oversized session
    resumption data may lead to arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1949">CVE-2008-1949</a>

    <p>Repeated client hellos may result in a pre-authentication denial of
    service condition due to a null pointer dereference.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1950">CVE-2008-1950</a>

    <p>Decoding cipher padding with an invalid record length may cause GNUTLS
    to read memory beyond the end of the received record, leading to a
    pre-authentication denial of service condition.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-3+etch1.  (Builds for the arm architecture are currently
not available and will be released later.)</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon. </p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your GNUTLS packages.</p>
