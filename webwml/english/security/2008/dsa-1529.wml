<p>
Multiple security problems have been discovered in the Firebird database,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.
</p>

<p>
This Debian security advisory is a bit unusual. While it's normally 
our strict policy to backport security bugfixes to older releases, this
turned out to be infeasible for Firebird 1.5 due to large infrastructural
changes necessary to fix these issues. As a consequence security support
for Firebird 1.5 is hereby discontinued, leaving two options to
administrators running a Firebird database:
</p>

<ol style="I">
<li> Administrators running Firebird in a completely internal setup with
    trusted users could leave it unchanged.</li>

<li> Everyone else should upgrade to the firebird2.0 packages available at 
    <a href="http://www.backports.org/backports.org/pool/main/f/firebird2.0/">backports.org</a>.<br /><br />

    Version 2.0.3.12981.ds1-6~bpo40+1 fixes all known issues.<br /><br />

    Please refer to the
    <a href="http://www.backports.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=instructions">general backports.org documentation</a>
    to add the packages to your package management configuration.<br /><br />

    These packages are backported to run with Debian stable. Since
    firebird2.0 is not a drop-in replacement for firebird2 (which
    is the source package name for the Firebird 1.5 packages)
    these updates are not released through security.debian.org.
    Corrections for potential future security problems affecting Debian stable will be
    released through backports.org as well.<br /><br />

    Arrangements have been made to ensure that Firebird in the upcoming
    Debian 5.0 release will be supportable with regular backported
    security bugfixes again.</li>
