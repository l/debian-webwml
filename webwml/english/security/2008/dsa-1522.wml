<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that unzip, when processing specially crafted
ZIP archives, could pass invalid pointers to the C library's free
routine, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0888">CVE-2008-0888</a>).</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.52-1sarge5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-9etch1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip package.</p>
