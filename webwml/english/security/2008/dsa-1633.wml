<define-tag description>SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that Slash, the Slashdot Like Automated
Storytelling Homepage suffers from two vulnerabilities related to
insufficient input sanitation, leading to execution of SQL commands 
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2231">CVE-2008-2231</a>) and cross-site scripting (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2553">CVE-2008-2553</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.6-8etch1.</p>

<p>In the unstable distribution (sid), the slash package is currently
uninstallable and will be removed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your slash package.</p>
