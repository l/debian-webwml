<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that eggdrop, an advanced IRC robot, was vulnerable
to a buffer overflow which could result in a remote user executing
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.6.18-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.17-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.18-1.1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eggdrop package.</p>
