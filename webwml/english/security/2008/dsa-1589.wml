<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libxslt, an XSLT processing runtime library,
could be coerced into executing arbitrary code via a buffer overflow
when an XSL style sheet file with a long XSLT "transformation match"
condition triggered a large number of steps.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.19-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.24-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt package.</p>
