<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the test.alert script used in one of the 
alert functions in mon, a system to monitor hosts or services and alert 
about problems, creates temporary files insecurely, which may lead to a local 
denial of service through symlink attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.2-9+etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 0.99.2-13.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mon package.</p>
