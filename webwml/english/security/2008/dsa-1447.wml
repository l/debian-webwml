<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.20-2etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.
