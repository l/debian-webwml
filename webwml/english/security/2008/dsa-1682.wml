<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivan Markovic discovered that SquirrelMail, a webmail application, did not
sufficiently sanitise incoming HTML email, allowing an attacker to perform
cross site scripting through sending a malicious HTML email.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
