<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in GNOME PeerCast,
the GNOME interface to PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6454">CVE-2007-6454</a>

    <p>Luigi Auriemma discovered that PeerCast is vulnerable to a heap
    overflow in the HTTP server code, which allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a
    long SOURCE request.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2040">CVE-2008-2040</a>

    <p>Nico Golde discovered that PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
    server, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the HTTP Basic
    Authentication code, allowing a remote attacker to crash PeerCast or
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-1.1etch0.</p>

<p>gnome-peercast has been removed from the unstable distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnome-peercast package.</p>
