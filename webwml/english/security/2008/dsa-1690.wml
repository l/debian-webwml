<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two denial of service conditions were discovered in avahi, a Multicast
DNS implementation.</p>

<p>Huge Dias discovered that the avahi daemon aborts with an assert error
if it encounters a UDP packet with source port 0 (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5081">CVE-2008-5081</a>).</p>

<p>It was discovered that the avahi daemon aborts with an assert error if
it receives an empty TXT record over D-Bus (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3372">CVE-2007-3372</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.16-3etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.23-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your avahi packages.</p>
