<p>"r0t" discovered that gnatsweb, a web interface to GNU GNATS, did not
correctly sanitize the database parameter in the main CGI script.  This
could allow the injection of arbitrary HTML, or javascript code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
4.00-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnatsweb package.</p>
