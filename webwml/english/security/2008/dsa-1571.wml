<define-tag description>predictable random number generator</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luciano Bello discovered that the random number generator in Debian's
openssl package is predictable.  This is caused by an incorrect
Debian-specific change to the openssl package (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0166">CVE-2008-0166</a>).  As a
result, cryptographic key material may be guessable.</p>

<p>This is a Debian-specific vulnerability which does not affect other
operating systems which are not based on Debian.  However, other systems
can be indirectly affected if weak keys are imported into them.</p>

<p>It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has
been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1 on Debian
systems is recreated from scratch.  Furthermore, all DSA keys ever used
on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should
be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a
secret random value used during signature generation.</p>

<p>The first vulnerable version, 0.9.8c-1, was uploaded to the unstable
distribution on 2006-09-17, and has since that date propagated to the testing and
current stable (etch) distributions.  The old stable distribution
(sarge) is not affected.</p>

<p>Affected keys include SSH keys, OpenVPN keys, DNSSEC keys, and key
material for use in X.509 certificates and session keys used in SSL/TLS
connections.  Keys generated with GnuPG or GNUTLS are not affected,
though.</p>

<p>A detector for known weak key material will be published at:</p>

  <p><url "http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz">
  <a href="http://security.debian.org/project/extra/dowkd/dowkd.pl.gz.asc">(OpenPGP signature)</a></p>

<p>Instructions how to implement key rollover for various packages will be
published at:</p>

  <p><a href="$(HOME)/security/key-rollover/">http://www.debian.org/security/key-rollover/</a></p>

<p>This web site will be continuously updated to reflect new and updated
instructions on key rollovers for packages using SSL certificates.
Popular packages not affected will also be listed.</p>

<p>In addition to this critical change, two other vulnerabilities have been
fixed in the openssl package which were originally scheduled for release
with the next etch point release: OpenSSL's DTLS (Datagram TLS,
basically <q>SSL over UDP</q>) implementation did not actually implement the
DTLS specification, but a potentially much weaker protocol, and
contained a vulnerability permitting arbitrary code execution
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4995">CVE-2007-4995</a>).  A side channel attack in the integer multiplication
routines is also addressed (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3108">CVE-2007-3108</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 0.9.8g-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package and subsequently
regenerate any cryptographic material, as outlined above.</p>
