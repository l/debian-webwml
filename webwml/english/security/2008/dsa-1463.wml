<p>
Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:
</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3278">CVE-2007-3278</a>

    <p>
    It was discovered that the DBLink module performed insufficient
    credential validation. This issue is also tracked as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6601">CVE-2007-6601</a>,
    since the initial upstream fix was incomplete.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4769">CVE-2007-4769</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that a bug in the handling
    of back-references inside the regular expressions engine could lead
    to an out of bounds read, resulting in a crash. This constitutes only
    a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL processes
    regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4772">CVE-2007-4772</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular
    expression could be tricked into an infinite loop, resulting in denial
    of service. This constitutes only a security problem if an application
    using PostgreSQL processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6067">CVE-2007-6067</a>

    <p>
    Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that the optimizer for regular
    expression could be tricked massive resource consumption. This
    constitutes only a security problem if an application using PostgreSQL
    processes regular expressions from untrusted sources.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6600">CVE-2007-6600</a>

    <p>
    Functions in index expressions could lead to privilege escalation. For
    a more in depth explanation please see the upstream announce available
    at <a href="http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.905">http://www.postgresql.org/about/news.905</a>.
    </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
For the old stable distribution (sarge), some of these problems have been
fixed in version 7.4.7-6sarge6 of the postgresql package. Please note that
the fix for <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6600">CVE-2007-6600</a> and for the handling of regular expressions
havn't been backported due to the intrusiveness of the fix. We recommend
to upgrade to the stable distribution if these vulnerabilities affect your
setup.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.19-0etch1.
</p>

<p>
The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains postgres-7.4.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-7.4 packages.
