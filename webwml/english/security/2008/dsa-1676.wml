<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that flamethrower creates predictable temporary
filenames, which may lead to a local denial of service through a symlink
attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.1.8-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flamethrower package.</p>
