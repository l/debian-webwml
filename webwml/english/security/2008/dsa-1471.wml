<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in the the Vorbis General Audio
Compression Codec, which may lead to denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code, if a user is tricked into opening to
a malformed Ogg Audio file with an application linked against
libvorbis.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2.dfsg-1.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.0-2.</p>
