<define-tag description>buffer overflows, null pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been found in uw-imap, an IMAP
implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<p>It was discovered that several buffer overflows can be triggered via a
long folder extension argument to the tmail or dmail program. This
could lead to arbitrary code execution (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5005">CVE-2008-5005</a>).</p>

<p>It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference could be triggered by
a malicious response to the QUIT command leading to a denial of service
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5006">CVE-2008-5006</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2002edebian1-13.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), these problems have been fixed in version 2007d~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your uw-imap packages.</p>
