<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in libicu,
International Components for Unicode, The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4770">CVE-2007-4770</a>
  libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier
  attempts to process backreferences to the nonexistent capture group
  zero (aka \0), which might allow context-dependent attackers to read
  from, or write to, out-of-bounds memory locations, related to
  corruption of REStackFrames.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4771">CVE-2007-4771</a>
  Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp
  in libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and
  earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of
  service (memory consumption) and possibly have unspecified other
  impact via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to
  the backtracking stack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version libicu (3.6-2etch1)</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libicu package.</p>
