<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stephen Gran and Mark Hymers discovered that some scripts run by GForge,
a collaborative development tool, open files in write mode in a potentially
insecure manner. This may be exploited to overwrite arbitary files on the
local system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
4.5.14-22etch8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge package.</p>
