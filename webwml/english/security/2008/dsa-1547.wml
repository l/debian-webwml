<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in
OpenOffice.org, the free office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5745">CVE-2007-5745</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5747">CVE-2007-5747</a>

    <p>Several bugs have been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org parses
    Quattro Pro files that may lead to a overflow in the heap
    potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5746">CVE-2007-5746</a>

    <p>Specially crafted EMF files can trigger a buffer overflow in the
    heap that may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0320">CVE-2008-0320</a>

    <p>A bug has been discovered in the processing of OLE files that can
    cause a buffer overflow in the heap potentially leading to the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Recently reported problems in the ICU library are fixed in separate
libicu packages with <a href="dsa-1511">DSA 1511</a> against which OpenOffice.org is linked.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch5.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable (sid) distributions these
problems have been fixed in version 2.4.0~ooh680m5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
