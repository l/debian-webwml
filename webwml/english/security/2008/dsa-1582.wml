<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nico Golde discovered that PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
server, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the HTTP Basic
Authentication code, allowing a remote attacker to crash PeerCast or
execure arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1217.toots.20060314-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1218+svn20080104-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your peercast package.</p>
