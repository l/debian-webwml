<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that util-linux, miscellaneous system utilities, 
didn't drop privileged user and group permissions in the correct order
in the mount and umount commands.  This could potentially allow a local
user to gain additional privileges.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-4sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.12r-19etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux package.</p>
