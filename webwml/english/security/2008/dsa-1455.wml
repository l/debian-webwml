<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in libarchive1,
a single library to read/write tar, cpio, pax, zip, iso9660 archives.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3641">CVE-2007-3641</a>

  <p>It was discovered that libarchive1 would miscompute the length of a buffer
  resulting in a buffer overflow if yet another type of corruption occurred
  in a pax extension header.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3644">CVE-2007-3644</a>

  <p>It was discovered that if an archive prematurely ended within a pax
  extension header the libarchive1 library could enter an infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3645">CVE-2007-3645</a>

  <p>If an archive prematurely ended within a tar header, immediately following
  a pax extension header, libarchive1 could dereference a NULL pointer.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge), does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.53-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive package.</p>
