<p>Don Armstrong discovered that ldapscripts, a suite of tools to manipulate
user accounts in LDAP, sends the password as a command line argument when
calling LDAP programs, which may allow a local attacker to read this password
from the process listing.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.4-2etch1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain an ldapscripts package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.7.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldapscripts package.</p>
