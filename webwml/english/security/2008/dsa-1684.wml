<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been found in lcms, a library and set of
commandline utilities for image color management.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5316">CVE-2008-5316</a>

    <p>Inadequate enforcement of fixed-length buffer limits allows an
    attacker to overflow a buffer on the stack, potentially enabling
    the execution of arbitrary code when a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVS-2008-5317">CVS-2008-5317</a>

    <p>An integer sign error in reading image gamma data could allow an
    attacker to cause an under-sized buffer to be allocated for
    subsequent image data, with unknown consequences potentially
    including the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted
    image is opened.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.15-1.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems are fixed in version 1.17.dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.</p>
