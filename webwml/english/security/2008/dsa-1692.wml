<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
It was discovered that php-xajax, a library to develop Ajax
applications, did not sufficiently sanitise URLs, which allows attackers
to perform cross-site scripting attacks by using malicious URLs.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.4-2+etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the testing (lenny) and unstable (sid) distributions this problem
has been fixed in version 0.2.5-1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your php-xajax package.
