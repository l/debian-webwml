<define-tag description>denial of service/privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6716">CVE-2007-6716</a>

    <p>Joe Jin reported a local denial of service vulnerability that
    allows system users to trigger an oops due to an improperly
    initialized data structure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1514">CVE-2008-1514</a>

    <p>Jan Kratochvil reported a local denial of service vulnerability in
    the ptrace interface for the s390 architecture. Local users can
    trigger an invalid pointer dereference, leading to a system panic.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3276">CVE-2008-3276</a>

    <p>Eugene Teo reported an integer overflow in the DCCP subsystem that
    may allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service in the
    form of a kernel panic.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3525">CVE-2008-3525</a>

    <p>Eugene Teo reported a lack of capability checks in the kernel
    driver for Granch SBNI12 leased line adapters (sbni), allowing
    local users to perform privileged operations.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3833">CVE-2008-3833</a>

    <p>The S_ISUID/S_ISGID bits were not being cleared during an inode
    splice, which, under certain conditions, can be exploited by local
    users to obtain the privileges of a group for which they are not a
    member. Mark Fasheh reported this issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4210">CVE-2008-4210</a>

    <p>David Watson reported an issue in the open()/creat() system calls
    which, under certain conditions, can be exploited by local users
    to obtain the privileges of a group for which they are not a
    member.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4302">CVE-2008-4302</a>

    <p>A coding error in the splice subsystem allows local users to
    attempt to unlock a page structure that has not been locked,
    resulting in a system crash.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-22etch3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>
