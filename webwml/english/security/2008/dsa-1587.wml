<p>Adam Zabrocki discovered that under certain circumstances mtr, a full 
screen ncurses and X11 traceroute tool, could be tricked into executing
arbitrary code via overly long reverse DNS records.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.71-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.73-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mtr package.</p>
