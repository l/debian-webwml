<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tobias Gruetzmacher discovered that a Debian-provided CRON script in dspam,
a statistical spam filter, included a database password on the command line.
This allowed a local attacker to read the contents of the dspam database,
such as emails.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
3.6.8-5etch1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain the dspam package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
3.6.8-5.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dspam package.</p>
