<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that newsx, an NNTP news exchange utility, was affected
by a buffer overflow allowing remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a news article containing a large number of lines starting with a period.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.6-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 1.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your newsx package.</p>
