<p>It was discovered that libimager-perl, a Perl extension for generating 24
bit images did not correctly handle 8-bit compressed images, which could
allow the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.50-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libimager-perl package.</p>
