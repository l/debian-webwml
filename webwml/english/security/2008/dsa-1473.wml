<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joachim Breitner discovered that Subversion support in scponly is
inherently insecure, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.  Further
investigation showed that rsync and Unison support suffer from similar
issues.  This set of issues has been assigned <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6350">CVE-2007-6350</a>.</p>

<p>In addition, it was discovered that it was possible to invoke with scp
with certain options that may lead to execution of arbitrary commands
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6415">CVE-2007-6415</a>).</p>

<p>This update removes Subversion, rsync and Unison support from the
scponly package, and prevents scp from being invoked with the dangerous
options.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.6-1etch1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your scponly package.</p>
