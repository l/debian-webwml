<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other
security problems. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3655">CVE-2008-3655</a>

    <p>Keita Yamaguchi discovered that several safe level restrictions
    are insufficiently enforced.</p></li>
 
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3656">CVE-2008-3656</a>

    <p>Christian Neukirchen discovered that the WebRick module uses
    inefficient algorithms for HTTP header splitting, resulting in
    denial of service through resource exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3657">CVE-2008-3657</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the dl module doesn't perform taintness
    checks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3790">CVE-2008-3790</a>

    <p>Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that recursively nested
    XML entities can lead to denial of service through resource
    exhaustion in rexml.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3905">CVE-2008-3905</a>

    <p>Tanaka Akira discovered that the resolv module uses sequential
    transaction IDs and a fixed source port for DNS queries, which
    makes it more vulnerable to DNS spoofing attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch3. Packages for arm will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.</p>
