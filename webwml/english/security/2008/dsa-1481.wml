<p>It was discovered that a directory traversal vulnerability in CherryPy,
a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework may lead to denial 
of service by deleting files through malicious session IDs in cookies.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain python-cherrypy.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-3etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-cherrypy packages.</p>
