<p>
A race condition in the OpenAFS fileserver allows remote attackers to
cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by simultaneously acquiring and
giving back file callbacks, which causes the handler for the
GiveUpAllCallBacks RPC to perform linked-list operations without the
host_glock lock.
</p>

<p>
For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.81-3sarge3.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6etch1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.
