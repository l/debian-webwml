<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6694">CVE-2007-6694</a>

    <p>Cyrill Gorcunov reported a NULL pointer dereference in code specific
    to the CHRP PowerPC platforms. Local users could exploit this issue
    to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0007">CVE-2008-0007</a>

    <p>Nick Piggin of SuSE discovered a number of issues in subsystems which
    register a fault handler for memory mapped areas. This issue can be
    exploited by local users to achieve a Denial of Service (DoS) and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1294">CVE-2008-1294</a>

    <p>David Peer discovered that users could escape administrator imposed cpu
    time limitations (RLIMIT_CPU) by setting a limit of 0.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1375">CVE-2008-1375</a>

    <p>Alexander Viro discovered a race condition in the directory notification
    subsystem that allows local users to cause a Denial of Service (oops)
    and possibly result in an escalation of privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-18etch3.</p>

<p>The unstable (sid) and testing distributions will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>
