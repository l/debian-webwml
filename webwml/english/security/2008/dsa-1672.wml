<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Julien Danjou and Peter De Wachter discovered that a buffer overflow
in the XPM loader of Imlib2, a powerful image loading and rendering
library, might lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0.0debian1-4+etch2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.0-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imlib2 packages.</p>
