<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered that the Xine media player library performed
insufficient input sanitising during the handling of RTSP streams,
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0.1-1sarge6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.8-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.</p>
