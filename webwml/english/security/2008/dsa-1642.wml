<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Will Drewry discovered that Horde allows remote attackers to send
an email with a crafted MIME attachment filename attribute to perform
cross site scripting.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1+debian0-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 package.</p>
