<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that gaim, an multi-protocol instant messaging client,
was vulnerable to several integer overflows in its MSN protocol handlers.
These could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1:2.0.0+beta5-10etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this package is not present.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gaim package.</p>
