<define-tag description>DNS cache poisoning</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Kaminsky discovered that properties inherent to the DNS protocol
lead to practical DNS cache poisoning attacks. Among other things,
successful attacks can lead to misdirected web traffic and email
rerouting.</p>

<p>This update changes Debian's dnsmasq packages to implement the
recommended countermeasure: UDP query source port randomization. This
change increases the size of the space from which an attacker has to
guess values in a backwards-compatible fashion and makes successful
attacks significantly more difficult.</p>

<p>This update also switches the random number generator to Dan
Bernstein's SURF.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.35-1+etch4. Packages for alpha will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.43-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq package.</p>
