<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the EXIF parsing code
of the libexif library, which can lead to denial of service or the 
execution of arbitrary code if a user is tricked into opening a
malformed image.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2645">CVE-2007-2645</a>

    <p>Victor Stinner discovered an integer overflow, which may result in
    denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6351">CVE-2007-6351</a>

    <p>Meder Kydyraliev discovered an infinite loop, which may result in
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6352">CVE-2007-6352</a>

    <p>Victor Stinner discovered an integer overflow, which may result
    in denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also fixes two potential NULL pointer deferences.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been
fixed in 0.6.9-6sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.13-5etch2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libexif packages.</p>
