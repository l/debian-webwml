<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint. </p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following 
problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4298">CVE-2008-4298</a>
    A memory leak in the http_request_parse function could be used by
    remote attackers to cause lighttpd to consume memory, and cause a
    denial of service attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4359">CVE-2008-4359</a>
    Inconsistant handling of URL patterns could lead to the disclosure
    of resources a server administrator did not anticipate when using
    rewritten URLs.
    
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4360">CVE-2008-4360</a>
    Upon filesystems which don't handle case-insensitive paths differently
    it might be possible that unanticipated resources could be made available
    by mod_userdir.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.13-4etch11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.</p>
