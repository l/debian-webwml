<p>Steve Kemp discovered that hf, an amateur-radio protocol suite using 
a soundcard as a modem, insecurely tried to execute an external command
which could lead to the elevation of privileges for local users.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.3-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-8.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hf package.</p>
