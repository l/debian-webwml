<define-tag description>DNS response spoofing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple weaknesses have been identified in PyDNS, a DNS client
implementation for the Python language.  Dan Kaminsky identified a
practical vector of DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning,
exploiting the limited entropy in a DNS transaction ID and lack of
UDP source port randomization in many DNS implementations.  Scott
Kitterman noted that python-dns is vulnerable to this predictability,
as it randomizes neither its transaction ID nor its source port.
Taken together, this lack of entropy leaves applications using
python-dns to perform DNS queries highly susceptible to response
forgery.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this
class of weakness as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1447">CVE-2008-1447</a>
and this specific instance in PyDNS as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4099">CVE-2008-4099</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.0-5.2+etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-dns package.</p>
