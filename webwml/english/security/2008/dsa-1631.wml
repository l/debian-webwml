<p>Andreas Solberg discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library,
could be forced to recursively evaluate entities, until available
CPU & memory resources were exhausted.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.27.dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 package.</p>
