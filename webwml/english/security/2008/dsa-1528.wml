<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter H&uuml;we and Hanno B&ouml;ck discovered that Serendipity, a weblog manager,
did not properly sanitise input to several scripts which allowed
cross site scripting.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain a serendipity package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.4-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your serendipity package.</p>
