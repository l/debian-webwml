<p>It was discovered that speex, the Speex codec command line tools, did
not correctly deal with negative offsets in a particular
header field.  This could allow a malicious file to execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.12-3etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your speex package.</p>
