<define-tag description>buffer overrun</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Cornelius discovered a vulnerability in the Radiance High
Dynamic Range (HDR) image parser in Blender, a 3D modelling
application.  The weakness could enable a stack-based buffer overflow
and the execution of arbitrary code if a maliciously-crafted HDR file
is opened, or if a directory containing such a file is browsed via
Blender's image-open dialog.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.42a-7.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.45-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your blender packages.</p>
