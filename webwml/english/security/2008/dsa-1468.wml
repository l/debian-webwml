<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0128">CVE-2008-0128</a>

    <p>Olaf Kock discovered that HTTPS encryption was insufficiently
    enforced for single-sign-on cookies, which could result in
    information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2450">CVE-2007-2450</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Manager and Host Manager web applications
    performed insufficient input sanitising, which could lead to cross site
    scripting.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also adapts the tomcat5.5-webapps package to the tightened
JULI permissions introduced in the previous tomcat5.5 DSA. However, it
should be noted, that the tomcat5.5-webapps is for demonstration and
documentation purposes only and should not be used for production
systems.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.20-2etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5.5 packages.</p>
