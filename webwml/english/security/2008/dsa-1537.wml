<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alin Rad Pop (Secunia) discovered a number of vulnerabilities in xpdf, a set
of tools for display and conversion of Portable Document Format (PDF) files.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
three problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4352">CVE-2007-4352</a>

    <p>Inadequate DCT stream validation allows an attacker to corrupt
    memory and potentially execute arbitrary code by supplying a
    maliciously crafted PDF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5392">CVE-2007-5392</a>

    <p>An integer overflow vulnerability in DCT stream handling could
    allow an attacker to overflow a heap buffer, enabling the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5393">CVE-2007-5393</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow vulnerability in xpdf's CCITT image compression
    handlers allows overflow on the heap, allowing an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code by supplying a maliciously crafted
    CCITTFaxDecode filter.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.01-9.1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.02-1.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf packages.</p>
