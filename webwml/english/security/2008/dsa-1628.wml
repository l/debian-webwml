<define-tag description>DNS response spoofing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Brian Dowling discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative name server
does not respond to DNS queries which contain certain characters,
increasing the risk of successful DNS spoofing (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3337">CVE-2008-3337</a>).  This
update changes PowerDNS to respond with SERVFAIL responses instead.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version 
2.9.20-8+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.21.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns package.</p>
