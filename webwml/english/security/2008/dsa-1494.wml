<define-tag description>missing access checks</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The vmsplice system call did not properly verify address arguments
passed by user space processes, which allowed local attackers to
overwrite arbitrary kernel memory, gaining root privileges
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0010">CVE-2008-0010</a>,
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0600">CVE-2008-0600</a>).</p>

<p>In the vserver-enabled kernels, a missing access check on certain
symlinks in /proc enabled local attackers to access resources in other
vservers (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0163">CVE-2008-0163</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.18.dfsg.1-18etch1.</p>

<p>In addition to these fixes, this update also incorporates changes from the
upcoming point release of the stable distribution.</p>

<p>Some architecture builds were not yet available at the time of DSA-1494-1.
This update to DSA-1494 provides linux-2.6 packages for these remaining
architectures, as well as additional binary packages that are built
from source code provided by linux-2.6.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>The unstable (sid) and testing distributions will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>
