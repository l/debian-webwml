<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Asterisk, a free
software PBX and telephony toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-6430">CVE-2007-6430</a>

    <p>Tilghman Lesher discovered that database-based registrations are
    insufficiently validated. This only affects setups, which are
    configured to run without a password and only host-based
    authentication.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1332">CVE-2008-1332</a>

    <p>Jason Parker discovered that insufficient validation of From:
    headers inside the SIP channel driver may lead to authentication
    bypass and the potential external initiation of calls.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1333">CVE-2008-1333</a>

    <p>This update also fixes a format string vulnerability, which can only be
    triggered through configuration files under control of the local
    administrator. In later releases of Asterisk this issue is remotely
    exploitable and tracked as <a
    href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-1333">CVE-2008-1333</a>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The status of the old stable distribution (sarge) is currently being
investigated. If affected, an update will be released through
security.debian.org.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.2.13~dfsg-2etch3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
