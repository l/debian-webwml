<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow in the color space handling
code of the Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter, which might result
in the execution of arbitrary code if a user is tricked into processing
a malformed file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
8.54.dfsg.1-5etch1 of gs-gpl and 8.15.3.dfsg.1-1etch1 of gs-esp.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.01-6 of gs-gpl and 7.07.1-9sarge1 of gs-esp.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gs-esp and gs-gpl packages.</p>
