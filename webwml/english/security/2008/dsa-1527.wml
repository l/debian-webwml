<p>Thomas de Grenier de Latour discovered that the checkrestart tool in the
debian-goodies suite of utilities, allowed local users to gain privileges
via shell metacharacters in the name of the executable file for a running
process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.27+etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.24+sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.34.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your debian-goodies package.</p>
