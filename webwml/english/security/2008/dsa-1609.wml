<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd,
a fast webserver with minimal memory footprint.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the 
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0983">CVE-2008-0983</a>
  <p>lighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not
  properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows 
  remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number 
  of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access. </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3948">CVE-2007-3948</a>
  <p>connections.c in lighttpd before 1.4.16 might accept more connections 
  than the configured maximum, which allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (failed assertion) via a large number of connection
  attempts.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-4etch9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.18-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.</p>
