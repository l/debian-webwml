<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the image
loading library for the Simple DirectMedia Layer 1.2. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6697">CVE-2007-6697</a>

    <p>Gynvael Coldwind discovered a buffer overflow in GIF image parsing,
    which could result in denial of service and potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0544">CVE-2008-0544</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in IFF ILBM image parsing
    could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.4-1etch1. Due to a copy &amp; paste error <q>etch1</q> was appended
to the version number instead of <q>sarge1</q>. Since the update is otherwise
technically correct, the update was not rebuilt on the buildd network.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-2+etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sdl-image1.2 packages.</p>
