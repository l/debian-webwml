<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Schmidt and Daniel Morissette discovered two vulnerabilities
in mapserver, a development environment for spatial and mapping
applications.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following two problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4542">CVE-2007-4542</a>

    <p>Lack of input sanitizing and output escaping in the CGI
    mapserver's template handling and error reporting routines leads
    to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4629">CVE-2007-4629</a>
    
    <p>Missing bounds checking in mapserver's template handling leads to
    a stack-based buffer overrun vulnerability, allowing a remote
    attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the CGI
    or httpd user.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.10.0-5.1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.10.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver (4.10.0-5.1+etch2) package.</p>
