<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Simon Willison discovered that in Django, a Python web framework, the
feature to retain HTTP POST data during user reauthentication allowed
a remote attacker to perform unauthorized modification of data through
cross site request forgery. This is possible regardless of the Django
plugin to prevent cross site request forgery being enabled. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies this issue as
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3909">CVE-2008-3909</a>.</p>

<p>In this update the affected feature is disabled; this is in accordance
with upstream's preferred solution for this situation.</p>

<p>This update takes the opportunity to also include a relatively minor
denial of service attack in the internationalisation framework, known
as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5712">CVE-2007-5712</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.95.1-1etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django package.</p>
