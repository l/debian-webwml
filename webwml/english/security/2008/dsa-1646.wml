<define-tag description>array bounds check</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A weakness has been discovered in squid, a caching proxy server.  The
flaw was introduced upstream in response to <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6239">CVE-2007-6239</a>, and
announced by Debian in <a href="dsa-1482">DSA-1482-1</a>.  The flaw involves an
over-aggressive bounds check on an array resize, and could be
exploited by an authorized client to induce a denial of service
condition against squid.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.5-6etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.</p>
