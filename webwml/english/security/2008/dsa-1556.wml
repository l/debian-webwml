<define-tag description>heap buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that the Perl interpreter may encounter a buffer
overflow condition when compiling certain regular expressions containing
Unicode characters.  This also happens if the offending characters are
contained in a variable reference protected by the \Q...\E quoting
construct.  When encountering this condition, the Perl interpreter
typically crashes, but arbitrary code execution cannot be ruled out.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.8-7etch3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
