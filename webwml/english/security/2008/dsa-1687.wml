<define-tag description>denial of service/privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3527">CVE-2008-3527</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy reported a local DoS and potential privilege
    escalation in the Virtual Dynamic Shared Objects (vDSO)
    implementation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3528">CVE-2008-3528</a>

    <p>Eugene Teo reported a local DoS issue in the ext2 and ext3
    filesystems.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to output error messages in an
    infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4554">CVE-2008-4554</a>

    <p>Milos Szeredi reported that the usage of splice() on files opened
    with O_APPEND allows users to write to the file at arbitrary
    offsets, enabling a bypass of possible assumed semantics of the
    O_APPEND flag.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4576">CVE-2008-4576</a>

    <p>Vlad Yasevich reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that may
    allow remote users to cause a local DoS by triggering a kernel
    oops.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4933">CVE-2008-4933</a>

    <p>Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that causes the kernel to overrun a buffer, resulting
    in a system oops or memory corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4934">CVE-2008-4934</a>

    <p>Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfsplus
    filesystem.  Local users who have been granted the privileges
    necessary to mount a filesystem would be able to craft a corrupted
    filesystem that results in a kernel oops due to an unchecked
    return value.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5025">CVE-2008-5025</a>

    <p>Eric Sesterhenn reported a local DoS issue in the hfs filesystem.
    Local users who have been granted the privileges necessary to
    mount a filesystem would be able to craft a filesystem with a
    corrupted catalog name length, resulting in a system oops or
    memory corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5029">CVE-2008-5029</a>

    <p>Andrea Bittau reported a DoS issue in the unix socket subsystem
    that allows a local user to cause memory corruption, resulting in
    a kernel panic.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5079">CVE-2008-5079</a>

    <p>Hugo Dias reported a DoS condition in the ATM subsystem that can
    be triggered by a local user by calling the svc_listen function
    twice on the same socket and reading /proc/net/atm/*vc.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5182">CVE-2008-5182</a>

    <p>Al Viro reported race conditions in the inotify subsystem that may
    allow local users to acquire elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5300">CVE-2008-5300</a>

    <p>Dann Frazier reported a DoS condition that allows local users to
    cause the out of memory handler to kill off privileged processes
    or trigger soft lockups due to a starvation issue in the unix
    socket subsystem.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-23etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
