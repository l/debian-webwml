<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Dennison discovered that Diatheke, a CGI program to make a bible
website, performs insufficient sanitising of a parameter, allowing a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands as the web server
user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.9-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.7-7sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.5.9-8.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your diatheke package.</p>
