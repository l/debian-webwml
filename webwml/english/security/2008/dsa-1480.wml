<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alin Rad Pop discovered several buffer overflows in the Poppler PDF
library, which could allow the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain poppler.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.5-5.1etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.</p>
