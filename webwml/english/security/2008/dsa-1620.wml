<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Python language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2052">CVE-2007-2052</a>

    <p>Piotr Engelking discovered that the strxfrm() function of the locale
    module miscalculates the length of an internal buffer, which may
    result in a minor information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4965">CVE-2007-4965</a>

    <p>It was discovered that several integer overflows in the imageop
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, if a user is
    tricked into processing malformed images. This issue is also
    tracked as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1679">CVE-2008-1679</a> due to an initially incomplete patch.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1721">CVE-2008-1721</a>
 
    <p>Justin Ferguson discovered that a buffer overflow in the zlib
    module may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1887">CVE-2008-1887</a>

    <p>Justin Ferguson discovered that insufficient input validation in
    PyString_FromStringAndSize() may lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-5+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python2.5 packages.</p>
