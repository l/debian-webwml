<p>Paul Szabo rediscovered a vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree
function of Perl. It was possible to exploit a race condition to create
setuid binaries in a directory tree or remove arbitrary files when a
process is deleting this tree.  This issue was originally known as
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-0448">CVE-2005-0448</a> and <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-0452">CVE-2004-0452</a>, which were addressed by DSA-696-1 and
DSA-620-1. Unfortunately, they were reintroduced later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.8.8-7etch5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in 
version 5.10.0-18 and will migrate to the testing distribution (lenny) 
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
