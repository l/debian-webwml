<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for
the Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2662">CVE-2008-2662</a>

    <p>Drew Yao discovered that multiple integer overflows in the string
    processing code may lead to denial of service and potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2663">CVE-2008-2663</a>

    <p>Drew Yao discovered that multiple integer overflows in the string
    processing code may lead to denial of service and potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2664">CVE-2008-2664</a>

    <p>Drew Yao discovered that a programming error in the string
    processing code may lead to denial of service and potentially the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2725">CVE-2008-2725</a>

    <p>Drew Yao discovered that an integer overflow in the array handling
    code may lead to denial of service and potentially the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2726">CVE-2008-2726</a>

    <p>Drew Yao discovered that an integer overflow in the array handling
    code may lead to denial of service and potentially the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2376">CVE-2008-2376</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the array handling
    code may lead to denial of service and potentially the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.5-4etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.7.22-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.8 packages.</p>
