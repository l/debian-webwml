<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the qemu-make-debian-root script in qemu,
fast processor emulator, creates temporary files insecurely, which may lead</p>

<p>to a local denial of service through symlink attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.2-4etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 0.9.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu package.</p>
