<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam anti-virus
toolkit, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary or local denial
of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6595">CVE-2007-6595</a>

    <p>It was discovered that temporary files are created insecurely,
    which may result in local denial of service by overwriting files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0318">CVE-2008-0318</a>

    <p>Silvio Cesare discovered an integer overflow in the parser for PE
    headers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The version of clamav in the old stable distribution (sarge) is no
longer supported with security updates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.1dfsg-3etch10. In addition to these fixes, this update
also incorporates changes from the upcoming point release of the
stable distribution (non-free RAR handling code was removed).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
