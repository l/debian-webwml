It was discovered that the patch for <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4659">CVE-2007-4659</a> could lead to
regressions in some scenarios. The fix has been reverted for now,
a revised update will be provided in a future PHP DSA.

    <p>
    It was discovered that the output_add_rewrite_var() function could
    leak session ID information, resulting in information disclosure.
    </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
This update also fixes two bugs from the PHP 5.2.4 release which
don't have security impact according to the Debian PHP security policy
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4657">CVE-2007-4657</a> and <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4662">CVE-2007-4662</a>), but which are fixed nonetheless.
</p>



<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain php5.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.0-8+etch10.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.4-1, with the exception of <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5898">CVE-2007-5898</a> and
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5899">CVE-2007-5899</a>, which will be fixed soon. Please note that Debian's
version of PHP is hardened with the Suhosin patch beginning with
version 5.2.4-1, which renders several vulnerabilities ineffective.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.
