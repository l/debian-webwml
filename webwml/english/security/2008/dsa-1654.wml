<p>It was discovered that libxml2, the GNOME XML library, didn't correctly
handle long entity names.  This could allow the execution of arbitrary
code via a malicious XML file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.27.dfsg-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 package.</p>
