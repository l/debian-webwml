<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the GIF image parsing code
of Tk, a cross-platform graphical toolkit, could lead to denial of
service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.9-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.12-1etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tk8.4 packages.</p>
