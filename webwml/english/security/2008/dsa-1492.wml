<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Frank Lichtenheld and Nico Golde discovered that WML, an off-line HTML
generation toolkit, creates insecure temporary files in the eperl and
ipp backends and in the wmg.cgi script, which could lead to local denial
of service by overwriting files.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wml packages.</p>
