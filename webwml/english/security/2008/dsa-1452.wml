<p>"k1tk4t" discovered that wzdftpd, a portable, modular, small and efficient
ftp server, did not correctly handle the receipt of long usernames.  This
could allow remote users to cause the daemon to exit.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.1-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-1.1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.2-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wzdftpd package.</p>
