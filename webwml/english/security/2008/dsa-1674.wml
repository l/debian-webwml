<define-tag description>insecure temp file generation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Pena discovered that updatejail, a component
of the chroot maintenance tool Jailer, creates a predictable temporary
file name, which may lead to local denial of service through a symlink
attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4-9+etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.4-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jailer package.</p>
