<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joan Calvet discovered that httrack, a utility to create local copies of
websites, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow potentially allowing to
execute arbitrary code when passed excessively long URLs.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.40.4-3.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has
been fixed in version 3.42.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your httrack package.</p>
