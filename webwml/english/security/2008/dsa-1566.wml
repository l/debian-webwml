<p>Dmitry Levin discovered a vulnerability in path handling code used by
the cpio archive utility.  The weakness could enable a denial of
service (crash) or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a
vulnerable version of cpio is used to extract or to list the contents
of a maliciously crafted archive.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-18.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cpio packages.</p>
