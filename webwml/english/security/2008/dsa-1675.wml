<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Masako Oono discovered that phpMyAdmin, a web-based administration
interface for MySQL, insufficiently sanitises input allowing a
remote attacker to gather sensitive data through cross site scripting,
provided that the user uses the Internet Explorer web browser.</p>

<p>This update also fixes a regression introduced in DSA 1641, that
broke changing of the language and encoding in the login screen.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.11.8.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
