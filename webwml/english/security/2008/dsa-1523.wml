<p>Josh Triplett discovered that ikiwiki did not block Javascript in
URLs, leading to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0808">CVE-2008-0808</a>,
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-0809">CVE-2008-0809</a>).</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) did not contain an ikiwiki package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.33.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.31.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki package.</p>
