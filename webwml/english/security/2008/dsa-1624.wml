<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered that a buffer overflow in the RC4 functions of 
libexslt may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.19-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.</p>
