<p>
Daniel B. Cid discovered that fail2ban, a tool to block IP addresses
that cause login failures, is too liberal about parsing SSH log files,
allowing an attacker to block any IP address.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain fail2ban.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.5-2etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.0-4.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban package.
