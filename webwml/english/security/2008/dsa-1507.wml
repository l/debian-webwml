<p>Peter Paul Elfferich discovered that turba2, a contact management component
for horde framework did not correctly check access rights before allowing
users to edit addresses.  This could result in valid users being able to
alter private address records.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.3-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.1.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your turba2 package.</p>
