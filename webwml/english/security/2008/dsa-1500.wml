<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mike Ashton discovered that splitvt, a utility to run two programs in a
split screen, did not drop group privileges prior to executing 'xprop'.
This could allow any local user to gain the privileges of group utmp.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.6.5-9etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your splitvt package.</p>
