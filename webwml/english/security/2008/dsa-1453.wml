    <p>
    It was discovered that single quotes (') in cookies were treated
    as a delimiter, which could lead to an information leak.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3385">CVE-2007-3385</a>

    <p>

    <p>

</ul>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain tomcat5.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.30-12etch1.
</p>

<p>
The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains tomcat5.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat5 packages.
