<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a
tool to administrate MySQL databases over the web. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4096">CVE-2008-4096</a>

    <p>Remote authenticated users could execute arbitrary code on the
    host running phpMyAdmin through manipulation of a script parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3457">CVE-2008-3457</a>

    <p>Cross site scripting through the setup script was possible in
    rare circumstances.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3456">CVE-2008-3456</a>

    <p>Protection has been added against remote websites loading phpMyAdmin
    into a frameset.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3197">CVE-2008-3197</a>

    <p>Cross site request forgery allowed remote attackers to create a new
    database, but not perform any other action on it.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:2.11.8.1-2.</p>
