<p>Micha Lenk discovered that backup-manager, a command-line backup tool,
sends the password as a command line argument when calling a FTP client,
which may allow a local attacker to read this password (which provides
access to all backed-up files) from the process listing.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.7-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.5-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
0.7.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your backup-manager package.</p>
