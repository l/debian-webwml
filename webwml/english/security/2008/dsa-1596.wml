<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TYPO3 content
management framework.</p>

<p>Because of a not sufficiently secure default value of the TYPO3
configuration variable fileDenyPattern, authenticated backend users
could upload files that allowed to execute arbitrary code as the
webserver user.</p>

<p>User input processed by fe_adminlib.inc is not being properly filtered
to prevent Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which is exposed when
specific plugins are in use.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
4.0.2+debian-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typo3 package.</p>
