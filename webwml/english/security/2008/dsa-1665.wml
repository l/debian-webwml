<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a heap overflow in the CDDB retrieval code of 
libcdaudio, a library for controlling a CD-ROM when playing audio CDs,
may result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.12p2-2+etch1. A package for hppa will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.99.12p2-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcdaudio packages.</p>
