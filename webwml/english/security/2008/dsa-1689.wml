<p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz of securityreason.com reported that ProFTPD is
vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and executes
arbitrary FTP commands via a long ftp:// URI that leverages an
existing session from the FTP client implementation in a web browser.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-19etch2 and in version 1.3.1-15~bpo40+1 for backports.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable (sid) distributions this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg package.</p>
