<p>It was discovered that lighttpd, a fast webserver with minimal memory
footprint, was didn't correctly handle SSL errors.  This could allow
a remote attacker to disconnect all active SSL connections.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.13-4etch7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.</p>
