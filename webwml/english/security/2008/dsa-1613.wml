<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in libgd2, a library
for programmatic graphics creation and manipulation.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2445">CVE-2007-2445</a>

    <p>Grayscale PNG files containing invalid tRNS chunk CRC values
    could cause a denial of service (crash), if a maliciously
    crafted image is loaded into an application using libgd.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3476">CVE-2007-3476</a>

    <p>An array indexing error in libgd's GIF handling could induce a
    denial of service (crash with heap corruption) if exceptionally
    large color index values are supplied in a maliciously crafted
    GIF image file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3477">CVE-2007-3477</a>

    <p>The imagearc() and imagefilledarc() routines in libgd allow
    an attacker in control of the parameters used to specify
    the degrees of arc for those drawing functions to perform
    a denial of service attack (excessive CPU consumption).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3996">CVE-2007-3996</a>

    <p>Multiple integer overflows exist in libgd's image resizing and
    creation routines; these weaknesses allow an attacker in control
    of the parameters passed to those routines to induce a crash or
    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
    an application or interpreter linked against libgd2.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.33-5.2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these
problems have been fixed in version 2.0.35.dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
