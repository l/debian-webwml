<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Amit Klein discovered that pdns-recursor, a caching DNS resolver, uses a
weak random number generator to create DNS transaction IDs and UDP
source port numbers.  As a result, cache poisoning attacks were
simplified. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1637">CVE-2008-1637</a>
and <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3217">CVE-2008-3217</a>)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.4-1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor package.</p>
