<p>Andrews Salomon reported that kazehakase, a GTK+-based web browser that
allows pluggable rendering engines, contained an embedded copy of the
PCRE library in its source tree which was compiled in and used in preference
to the system-wide version of this library.</p>

<p>The PCRE library has been updated to fix the security issues reported
against it in previous Debian Security Advisories.  This update ensures that
kazehakase  uses that supported library, and not its own embedded and
insecure version.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.4.2-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kazehakase package.</p>
