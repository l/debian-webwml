<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mantis, a web based
bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6574">CVE-2006-6574</a>

    <p>Custom fields were not appropriately protected by per-item access
    control, allowing for sensitive data to be published.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6611">CVE-2007-6611</a>

    <p>Multiple cross site scripting issues allowed a remote attacker to
    insert malicious HTML or web script into Mantis web pages.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-5sarge5.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.8-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.</p>
