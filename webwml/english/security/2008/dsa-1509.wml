<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in xpdf code that is
embedded in koffice, an integrated office suite for KDE.  These flaws
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by inducing the user
to import a specially crafted PDF document.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4352">CVE-2007-4352</a>
<p>Array index error in the DCTStream::readProgressiveDataUnit method in
xpdf/Stream.cc in Xpdf 3.02pl1, as used in poppler, teTeX, KDE, KOffice,
CUPS, and other products, allows remote attackers to trigger memory
corruption and execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5392">CVE-2007-5392</a>
<p>Integer overflow in the DCTStream::reset method in xpdf/Stream.cc in
Xpdf 3.02p11 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a
crafted PDF file, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5393">CVE-2007-5393</a>
<p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the CCITTFaxStream::lookChar method in
xpdf/Stream.cc in Xpdf 3.02p11 allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary code via a PDF file that contains a crafted CCITTFaxDecode
filter.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Updates for the old stable distribution (sarge), will be made available
as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1:1.6.1-2etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your koffice package.</p>
