<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Icedove mail
client, an unbranded version of the Thunderbird client. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0412">CVE-2008-0412</a>

    <p>Jesse Ruderman, Kai Engert, Martijn Wargers, Mats Palmgren and Paul
    Nickerson discovered crashes in the layout engine, which might allow
    the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0413">CVE-2008-0413</a>

    <p>Carsten Book, Wesley Garland, Igor Bukanov, <q>moz_bug_r_a4</q>, <q>shutdown</q>,
    Philip Taylor and <q>tgirmann</q> discovered crashes in the JavaScript
    engine, which might allow the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0415">CVE-2008-0415</a>

    <p><q>moz_bug_r_a4</q> and Boris Zbarsky discovered several
    vulnerabilities in JavaScript handling, which could allow
    privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0418">CVE-2008-0418</a>

    <p>Gerry Eisenhaur and <q>moz_bug_r_a4</q> discovered that a directory
    traversal vulnerability in chrome: URI handling could lead to
    information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0419">CVE-2008-0419</a>

    <p>David Bloom discovered a race condition in the image handling of

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-0591">CVE-2008-0591</a>

    <p>Michal Zalewski discovered that timers protecting security-sensitive
    dialogs (by disabling dialog elements until a timeout is reached)
    could be bypassed by window focus changes through JavaScript.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The Mozilla products from the old stable distribution (sarge) are no
longer supported with security updates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0.13+1.5.0.15b.dfsg1-0etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
