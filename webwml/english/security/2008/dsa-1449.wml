<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that loop-aes-utils, tools for mounting and manipulating
filesystems, didn't drop privileged users and groups in the correct order
in the mount and unmount commands.  This could potentially allow a local
user to gain additional privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.12r-15+etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-4sarge2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your loop-aes-utils package.</p>
