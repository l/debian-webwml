<p>Rob Holland discovered several programming errors in WordNet, an
electronic lexical database of the English language. These flaws could
allow arbitrary code execution when used with untrusted input, for
example when WordNet is in use as a back end for a web application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.0-11+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.0-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordnet package.</p>
