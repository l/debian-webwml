<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bartlomiej Balcerek discovered several buffer overflows in TORQUE server,
a PBS-derived batch processing server.  This allows an attacker to crash the
service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the server via crafted
job or host names.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain torque.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.15+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.15+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.</p>
