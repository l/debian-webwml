<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Debian X wrapper enforces that the X server can only be started from
a console. <q>vladz</q> discovered that this wrapper could be bypassed.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5+8+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.6+10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xorg packages.</p>
