<define-tag description>insufficient checks</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different
virtualization systems, did not properly check for read-only connections.
This allowed a local attacker to perform a denial of service (crash) or
possibly escalate privileges.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.</p>
