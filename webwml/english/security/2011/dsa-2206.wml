<p>Two security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mahara, a fully
featured electronic portfolio, weblog, resume builder and social
networking system:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0439">CVE-2011-0439</a>

    <p>A security review commissioned by a Mahara user discovered that
    Mahara processes unsanitized input which can lead to cross-site
    scripting (XSS).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2011-0440">CVE-2011-0440</a>

    <p>Mahara Developers discovered that Mahara doesn't check the session
    key under certain circumstances which can be exploited as
    cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and can lead to the deletion of
    blogs.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze1.</p>
