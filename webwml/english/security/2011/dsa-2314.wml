<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3848">CVE-2011-3848</a>

    <p>Kristian Erik Hermansen reported that an unauthenticated
    directory traversal could drop any valid X.509 Certificate Signing
    Request at any location on disk, with the privileges of the Puppet
    Master application.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3870">CVE-2011-3870</a>

    <p>Ricky Zhou discovered a potential local privilege escalation in the
    ssh_authorized_keys resource and theoretically in the Solaris and
    AIX providers, where file ownership was given away before it was
    written, leading to a possibility for a user to overwrite arbitrary
    files as root, if their authorized_keys file was managed.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3869">CVE-2011-3869</a>

    <p>A predictable file name in the k5login type leads to the possibility
    of symlink attacks which would allow the owner of the home directory
    to symlink to anything on the system, and have it replaced with the
    <q>correct</q> content of the file, which can lead to a privilege escalation
    on puppet runs.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3871">CVE-2011-3871</a>

    <p>A potential local privilege escalation was found in the --edit mode
    of <q>puppet resource</q> due to a persistent, predictable file name,
    which can result in editing an arbitrary target file, and thus be
    be tricked into running that arbitrary file as the invoking
    user.  This command is most commonly run as root, this leads to a
    potential privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, this update hardens the indirector file backed terminus base
class against injection attacks based on trusted path names.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
