<define-tag description>arbitrary file overwrite</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nicolas Gregoire discovered that the XML Security Library xmlsec allowed
remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files through
specially crafted XML files using the libxslt output extension and a
ds:Transform element during signature verification.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.9-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.14-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.14-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmlsec1 packages.</p>
