<define-tag description>directory traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Wilk discovered that the dpkg-source component of dpkg, the Debian
package management system, doesn't correctly handle paths in patches of
source packages, which could make it traverse directories.
Rapha&euml;l Hertzog additionally discovered that symbolic links in the .pc
directory are followed, which could make it traverse directories too.</p>

<p>Both issues only affect source packages using the "3.0 quilt" format at
unpack-time.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.14.31.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distributions (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
