<define-tag description>NULL pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Pango did not check for memory allocation
failures, causing a NULL pointer dereference with an adjustable
offset.  This can lead to application crashes and potentially
arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.28.3-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.</p>
