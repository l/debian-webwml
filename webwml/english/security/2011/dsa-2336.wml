<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were found in FFmpeg, a multimedia player,
server and encoder:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3362">CVE-2011-3362</a>

    <p>An integer signedness error in decode_residual_block function of 
    the Chinese AVS video (CAVS) decoder in libavcodec can lead to 
    denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or 
    possible code execution via a crafted CAVS file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3973">CVE-2011-3973</a>/<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3974">CVE-2011-3974</a>

    <p>Multiple errors in the Chinese AVS video (CAVS) decoder can lead to 
    denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via an 
    invalid bitstream.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3504">CVE-2011-3504</a>

    <p>A memory allocation problem in the Matroska format decoder can lead 
    to code execution via a crafted file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.5-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.7.2-1 of the libav source package.</p>

<p>Security support for ffmpeg has been discontinued for the oldstable
distribution (lenny) before in <a href="dsa-2306">DSA 2306</a>.
The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we needed to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
