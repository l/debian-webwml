<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Exim, Debian's default mail transfer agent, is
vulnerable to command injection attacks in its DKIM processing code,
leading to arbitrary code execution. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1407">CVE-2011-1407</a>)</p>

<p>The default configuration supplied by Debian does not expose this
vulnerability.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.72-6+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.76-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
