<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3677">CVE-2010-3677</a>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3836">CVE-2010-3836</a>

  <p>It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled pre-evaluation of LIKE
  predicates during view preparation.
  An authenticated user could crash the server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3837">CVE-2010-3837</a>

  <p>It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled using GROUP_CONCAT()
  and WITH ROLLUP together.

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3838">CVE-2010-3838</a>

  <p>It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain queries using a
  mixed list of numeric and LONGBLOB arguments to the GREATEST() or

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.51a-24+lenny5.</p>

<p>The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.</p>
