<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Will Dormann and Jared Allar discovered that the Lotus Word Pro import
filter of OpenOffice.org, a full-featured office productivity suite that
provides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft Office, is not
properly handling object ids in the <q>.lwp</q> file format.  An attacker can
exploit this with a specially crafted file and execute arbitrary code with
the rights of the victim importing the file.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
libreoffice version 1:3.3.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
