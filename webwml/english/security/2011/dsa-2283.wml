<p>Tim Zingelmann discovered that due an incorrect configure script the 
kerborised FTP server failed to set the effective GID correctly, 
resulting in privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5-appl packages.</p>
