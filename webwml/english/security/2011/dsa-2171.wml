<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matthew Nicholson discovered a buffer overflow in the SIP channel driver
of Asterisk, an open source PBX and telephony toolkit, which could lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2.9-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
