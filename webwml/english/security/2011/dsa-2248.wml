<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Wouter Coekaerts discovered that ejabberd, a distributed XMPP/Jabber server
written in Erlang, is vulnerable to the so-called <q>billion laughs</q> attack
because it does not prevent entity expansion on received data.
This allows an attacker to perform denial of service attacks against the
service by sending specially crafted XML data to it.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-6+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.6-2.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.</p>
