<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The developers of Tor, an anonymizing overlay network for TCP, found three 
security issues during a security audit. A heap overflow allowed the execution 
of arbitrary code 
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0427">CVE-2011-0427</a>), 
a denial of service vulnerability was found in the zlib compression handling 
and some key memory was incorrectly zeroed out before being freed. The latter 
two issues do not yet have CVE identifiers assigned. The Debian Security
Tracker will be updated once they're available:
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/tor">\
http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/source-package/tor</a></p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.29-1~lenny+1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.29-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.21-alpha-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
