<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Avahi, an implementation of the zeroconf protocol,
can be crashed remotely by a single UDP packet, which may result in a
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.23-3lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.27-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 0.6.28-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your avahi packages.</p>
