<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tomas Hoger found a buffer overflow in the X.Org libXfont library,
which may allow for a local privilege escalation through crafted
font files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3-2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxfont packages.</p>
