<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2703">CVE-2011-2703</a>

  <p>Several instances of insufficient escaping of user input, leading to
  SQL injection attacks via OGC filter encoding (in WMS, WFS, and SOS
  filters).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2704">CVE-2011-2704</a>

  <p>Missing length checks in the processing of OGC filter encoding that can
  lead to stack-based buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.5-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.</p>
