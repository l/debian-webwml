<p>Jon Larimer from IBM X-Force Advanced Research discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the DVI backend of the Evince document viewer:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2640">CVE-2010-2640</a>

    <p>Insufficient array bounds checks in the PK fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2641">CVE-2010-2641</a>

    <p>Insufficient array bounds checks in the VF fonts parser could lead
    to function pointer overwrite, causing arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642">CVE-2010-2642</a>

    <p>Insufficient bounds checks in the AFM fonts parser when writing
    data to a memory buffer allocated on heap could lead to arbitrary
    memory overwrite and arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2643">CVE-2010-2643</a>

    <p>Insufficient check on an integer used as a size for memory
    allocation can lead to arbitrary write outside the allocated range
    and cause arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.22.2-4~lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2640">CVE-2010-2640</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2641">CVE-2010-2641</a>
and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2643">CVE-2010-2643</a> have been fixed in version 2.30.3-2 but the fix for
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642">CVE-2010-2642</a> was incomplete. The final fix is present in version
2.30.3-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.</p>
