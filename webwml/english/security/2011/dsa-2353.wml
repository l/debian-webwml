<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>David Wheeler discovered a buffer overflow in ldns's code to parse
RR records, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldns packages.</p>
