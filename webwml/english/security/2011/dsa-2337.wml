<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Xen virtual machine
hypervisor.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1166">CVE-2011-1166</a>

  <p>A 64-bit guest can get one of its vCPUs into non-kernel
  mode without first providing a valid non-kernel pagetable,
  thereby locking up the host system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1583">CVE-2011-1583</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3262">CVE-2011-3262</a>

  <p>Local users can cause a denial of service and possibly execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted paravirtualised guest kernel image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1898">CVE-2011-1898</a>

  <p>When using PCI passthrough on Intel VT-d chipsets that do not
  have interrupt remapping, guest OS users can gain host OS
  privileges by writing to the interrupt injection registers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) contains a different version of Xen
not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-4.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 4.1.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
