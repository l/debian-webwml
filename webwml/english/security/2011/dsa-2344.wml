<define-tag description>deserialization vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Piston framework can deserializes untrusted
YAML and Pickle data, leading to remote code execution (<a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4103">CVE-2011-4103</a>).
</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (lenny) does not contain a
python-django-piston package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django-piston packages.</p>
