<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Vincent Bernat discovered that pimd, a multicast routing daemon, creates
files with predictable names upon the receipt of particular signals.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-alpha29.17-8.1lenny1.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will receive updates shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pimd packages.</p>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
