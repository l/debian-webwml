<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the floating point parser in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform, can enter an infinite loop when
processing certain input strings.  Such input strings represent valid
numbers and can be contained in data supplied by an attacker over the
network, leading to a denial-of-service attack.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.3-2~lenny1.  For technical reasons, this update will
be released separately.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.3-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
