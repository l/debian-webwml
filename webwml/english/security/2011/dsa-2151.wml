<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in the
OpenOffice.org package that allows malformed documents to trick the
system into crashes or even the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3450">CVE-2010-3450</a>

    <p>During an internal security audit within Red Hat, a directory
    traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the way
    OpenOffice.org 3.1.1 through 3.2.1 processes XML filter files.  If
    a local user is tricked into opening a specially-crafted OOo XML
    filters package file, this problem could allow remote attackers to
    create or overwrite arbitrary files belonging to local user or,
    potentially, execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3451">CVE-2010-3451</a>

    <p>During his work as a consultant at Virtual Security Research
    (VSR), Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in
    OpenOffice.org's RTF parsing functionality.  Opening a maliciously
    crafted RTF document can caus an out-of-bounds memory read into
    previously allocated heap memory, which may lead to the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3452">CVE-2010-3452</a>

    <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered a vulnerability in the RTF file parser
    which can be leveraged by attackers to achieve arbitrary code
    execution by convincing a victim to open a maliciously crafted RTF
    file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3453">CVE-2010-3453</a>

    <p>As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager()
    function of OpenOffice.org that allows a maliciously crafted file
    to cause the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3454">CVE-2010-3454</a>

    <p>As part of his work with Virtual Security Research, Dan Rosenberg
    discovered a vulnerability in the WW8DopTypography::ReadFromMem()
    function in OpenOffice.org that may be exploited by a maliciously
    crafted file which allowins an attacker to control program flow
    and potentially execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3689">CVE-2010-3689</a>

    <p>Dmitri Gribenko discovered that the soffice script does not treat
    an empty LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable like an unset one, may lead to
    the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4253">CVE-2010-4253</a>

    <p>A heap based buffer overflow has been discovered with unknown 
    impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4643">CVE-2010-4643</a>

    <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the way OpenOffice.org
    handles TGA graphics which can be tricked by a specially crafted
    TGA file that could cause the program to crash due to a heap-based
    buffer overflow with unknown impact.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny11.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) these problems have
been fixed in version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.1-11+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.0~rc3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.</p>
