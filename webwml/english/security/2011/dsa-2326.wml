<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kees Cook of the ChromeOS security team discovered a buffer overflow
in pam_env, a PAM module to set environment variables through the
PAM stack, which allowed the execution of arbitrary code. An additional
issue in argument parsing allows denial of service.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-6.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon
(the impact in sid is limited to denial of service for both issues).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pam packages.</p>
