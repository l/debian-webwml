<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Moritz Naumann discovered that IMP 4, a webmail component for the Horde
framework, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks by a lack of input
sanitising of certain Fetchmail information.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-4lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1, which was already included in the squeeze
release.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.3.7+debian0-2.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imp4 packages.</p>
