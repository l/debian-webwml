<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that insufficient input validation in VLC's 
processing of Matroska/WebM containers could lead to the execution of 
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze3.</p>

<p>The version of vlc in the oldstable distribution (lenny) is affected
by further issues and will be addressed in a followup DSA.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
