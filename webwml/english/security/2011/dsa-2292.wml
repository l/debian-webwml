<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>David Zych discovered that the ISC DHCP crashes when processing
certain packets, leading to a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-6+lenny6 of the dhcp3 package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze3 of the isc-dhcp package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ISC DHCP packages.</p>
