<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered in libcgroup, a library to control
and monitor control groups:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1006">CVE-2011-1006</a>

   <p>Heap-based buffer overflow by converting list of controllers for
   given task into an array of strings could lead to privilege
   escalation by a local attacker.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1022">CVE-2011-1022</a>

    <p>libcgroup did not properly check the origin of Netlink messages,
    allowing a local attacker to send crafted Netlink messages which
    could lead to privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain libgroup packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.36.2-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcgroup packages.</p>
