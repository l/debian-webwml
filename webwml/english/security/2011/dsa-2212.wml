<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Daniel Danner discovered that tmux, a terminal multiplexer, is not
properly dropping group privileges.  Due to a patch introduced by Debian,
when invoked with the -S option, tmux is not dropping permissions obtained
through its setgid installation.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem,
it does not include tmux.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tmux packages.</p>
