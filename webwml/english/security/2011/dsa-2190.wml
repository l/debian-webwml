<p>Two XSS bugs and one potential information disclosure issue were discovered
in wordpress, a weblog manager.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0700">CVE-2011-0700</a>

  <p>Input passed via the post title when performing a <q>Quick Edit</q> or 
  <q>Bulk Edit</q> action and via the <q>post_status</q>, <q>comment_status</q>, 
  and <q>ping_status</q> parameters is not properly sanitised before being used.
  Certain input passed via tags in the tags meta-box is not properly sanitised
  before being returned to the user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0701">CVE-2011-0701</a>

  <p>Wordpress incorrectly enforces user access restrictions when accessing posts
  via the media uploader and can be exploited to disclose the contents
  of e.g. private or draft posts.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.5+dfsg-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.5+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
