<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Neel Mehta discovered that a race condition in Policykit, a framework
for managing administrative policies and privileges, allowed local
users to elevate privileges by executing a setuid program from pkexec.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain the policykit-1
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.96-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.101-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your policykit-1 packages.</p>
