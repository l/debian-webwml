<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that insufficient input sanitising in Freetype's code to
parse Type1 could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-2+lenny6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-2.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
