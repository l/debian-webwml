<p>Philip Martin discovered that HTTP-based Subversion servers crash when
processing lock requests on repositories which support unauthenticated
read access.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1dfsg1-6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed in version 1.6.16dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
