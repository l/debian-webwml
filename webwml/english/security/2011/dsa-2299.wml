<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An unauthorized SSL certificate has been found in the wild issued
the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company. Debian, like other software
distributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar
Root CA by default in its ca-certificates bundle.</p>

<p>For other software in Debian that ships a CA bundle, like the
Mozilla suite, updates are forthcoming.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), the ca-certificates package
does not contain this root CA.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), the root CA has been
disabled starting ca-certificates version 20090814+nmu3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution
(sid), the root CA has been disabled starting ca-certificates
version 20110502+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ca-certificates packages.</p>
