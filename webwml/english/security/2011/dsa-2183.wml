<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered a regression of a buffer overflow (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3534">CVE-2005-3534</a>) in NBD, 
the Network Block Device server, that could allow arbitrary code execution
on the NBD server via a large request.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.9.11-3lenny1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (squeeze), the testing distribution (wheezy),
and the unstable distribution (sid) are not affected. This problem was
fixed prior the release of squeeze in version 1:2.9.16-8.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.</p>
