<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in webkit, a Web content engine
library for Gtk+. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1783">CVE-2010-1783</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly handle dynamic modification of a text node, which 
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service 
  (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted HTML 
  document.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2901">CVE-2010-2901</a>

  <p>The rendering implementation in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a 
  denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other 
  impact via unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4199">CVE-2010-4199</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during 
  processing of an SVG use element, which allows remote attackers to cause a 
  denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SVG 
  document.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4040">CVE-2010-4040</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly handle animated GIF images, which allows remote 
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have 
  unspecified other impact via a crafted image.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4492">CVE-2010-4492</a>

  <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit allows remote attackers to cause a 
  denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors 
  involving SVG animations.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4493">CVE-2010-4493</a>

  <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in Webkit allows remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service via vectors related to the handling of mouse dragging 
  events.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4577">CVE-2010-4577</a>

  <p>The CSSParser::parseFontFaceSrc function in WebCore/css/CSSParser.cpp in
  WebKit does not properly parse Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequences,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds 
  read) via a crafted local font, related to <q>Type Confusion</q>.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4578">CVE-2010-4578</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly perform cursor handling, which allows remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other
  impact via unknown vectors that lead to <q>stale pointers</q>.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0482">CVE-2011-0482</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during
  handling of anchors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of 
  service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted HTML 
  document.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0778">CVE-2011-0778</a>

  <p>WebKit does not properly restrict drag and drop operations, which might 
  allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via unspecified 
  vectors.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.7-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.7-1.</p>

<p>Security support for WebKit has been discontinued for the oldstable 
distribution (lenny).  The current version in oldstable is not supported by 
upstream anymore and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes 
for these and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webkit packages.</p>
