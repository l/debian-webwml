<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Perl's Safe module - a module to compile and
execute code in restricted compartments - could be bypassed.</p>

<p>Please note that this update is known to break Petal, an XML-based
templating engine (shipped with Debian 6.0/Squeeze in the package
libpetal-perl, see 
<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582805">\
bug #582805</a> for details). A fix is not yet available. If you use Petal, you 
might consider to put the previous Perl packages on hold.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.0-19lenny5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.12.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
