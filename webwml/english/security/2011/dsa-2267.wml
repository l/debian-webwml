<p>It was discovered that Perl's Safe module - a module to compile and
execute code in restricted compartments - could by bypassed.</p>

<p>Please note that this update is known to break Petal, an XML-based
templating engine (shipped with Debian 6.0/Squeeze in the package
libpetal-perl, see http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=582805
for details). A fix is not yet available. If you use Petal, you might
consider to put the previous Perl packages on hold.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.0-19lenny5.</p>

version 5.10.1-17squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
