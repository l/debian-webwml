<p>Multiple security issues were discovered by Vasiliy Kulikov in radvd, an
IPv6 Router Advertisement daemon:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3602">CVE-2011-3602</a>

   <p>set_interface_var() function doesn't check the interface name, which is
   chosen by an unprivileged user. This could lead to an arbitrary file
   overwrite if the attacker has local access, or specific files overwrites
   otherwise.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3604">CVE-2011-3604</a>

   <p>process_ra() function lacks multiple buffer length checks which could
   lead to memory reads outside the stack, causing a crash of the daemon.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3605">CVE-2011-3605</a>

   <p>process_rs() function calls mdelay() (a function to wait for a defined
   time) unconditionnally when running in unicast-only mode. As this call
   is in the main thread, that means all request processing is delayed (for
   a time up to MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME, 500 ms by default). An attacker could
   flood the daemon with router solicitations in order to fill the input
   queue, causing a temporary denial of service (processing would be
   stopped during all the mdelay() calls).
<br/>
   Note: upstream and Debian default is to use anycast mode.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.1-3.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6-1.1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your radvd packages.</p>
