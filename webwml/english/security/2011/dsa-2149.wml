<p>R&eacute;mi Denis-Courmont discovered that dbus, a message bus application,
is not properly limiting the nesting level when examining messages with
extensive nested variants.  This allows an attacker to crash the dbus system
daemon due to a call stack overflow via crafted messages.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-5+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.24-4.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.</p>
