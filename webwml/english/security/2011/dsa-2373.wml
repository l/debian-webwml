<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Kerberos support for telnetd contains a
pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote attackers
who can connect to TELNET to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.5.dfsg.1-9+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.6-3.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your inetutils packages.</p>
