<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Buffer overflow in the <q>Linux emulation</q> support in FreeBSD kernel
allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly
execute arbitrary code by calling the bind system call with a long path
for a UNIX-domain socket, which is not properly handled when the
address is used by other unspecified system calls.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.2-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.</p>
