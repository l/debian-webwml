<p>The PNG library libpng has been affected by several vulnerabilities. The most 
critical one is the identified as 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2690">\
CVE-2011-2690</a>. Using this vulnerability, an attacker is able to overwrite 
memory with an arbitrary amount of data controlled by her via a crafted PNG 
image.</p>

<p>The other vulnerabilities are less critical and allow an attacker to 
cause a crash in the program (denial of service) via a crafted PNG 
image.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny5. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive processing scripts, the updated packages cannot be released
in parallel with the packages for Squeeze. They will appear shortly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.46-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
