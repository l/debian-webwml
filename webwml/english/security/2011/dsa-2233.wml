<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Postfix, a mail transfer
agent.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2939">CVE-2009-2939</a>
        <p>The postinst script grants the postfix user write access to
        /var/spool/postfix/pid, which might allow local users to
        conduct symlink attacks that overwrite arbitrary files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411">CVE-2011-0411</a>
        <p>The STARTTLS implementation does not properly restrict I/O
        buffering, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert
        commands into encrypted SMTP sessions by sending a cleartext
        command that is processed after TLS is in place.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1720">CVE-2011-1720</a>
        <p>A heap-based read-only buffer overflow allows malicious
        clients to crash the smtpd server process using a crafted SASL
        authentication request.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.5-1.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postfix packages.</p>
