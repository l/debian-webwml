<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Mojarra, an implementation of JavaServer Faces,
evaluates untrusted values as EL expressions if includeViewParameters
is set to true.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mojarra packages.</p>
