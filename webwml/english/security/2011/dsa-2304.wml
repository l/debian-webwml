<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ben Hawkes discovered that SquidÂ 3, a full featured Web Proxy cache
(HTTP proxy), is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing Gopher
server replies.  An attacker can exploit this flaw by connecting to a
Gopher server that returns lines longer than 4096 bytes.  This may result
in denial of service conditions (daemon crash) or the possibly the
execution of arbitrary code with rights of the squid daemon.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.STABLE8-3+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.15-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
