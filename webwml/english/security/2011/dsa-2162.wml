<define-tag description>invalid memory access</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Neel Mehta discovered that an incorrectly formatted ClientHello handshake
message could cause OpenSSL to parse past the end of the message.  This
allows an attacker to crash an application using OpenSSL by triggering
an invalid memory access.  Additionally, some applications may be vulnerable
to expose contents of a parsed OCSP nonce extension.</p>

problem.</p>
