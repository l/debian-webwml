<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered by <q>frosty_un</q> that a design flaw in Tor, an online
privacy tool, allows malicious relay servers to learn certain information
that they should not be able to learn. Specifically, a relay that a user
connects to directly could learn which other relays that user is
connected to directly. In combination with other attacks, this issue
can lead to deanonymizing the user.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project has assigned <a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2768">\
CVE-2011-2768</a> to this issue.</p>

<p>In addition to fixing the above mentioned issues, the updates to oldstable
and stable fix a number of less critical issues (<a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2769">\
CVE-2011-2769</a>). Please
see the <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-02234-released-security-patches">\
posting from the Tor blog</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1~lenny+1. Due to technical limitations in the Debian
archive scripts, the update cannot be released synchronously with the
packages for stable. It will be released shortly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.31-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable (sid) and testing (wheezy) distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.34-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, this problem have has been fixed in version
0.2.3.6-alpha-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
