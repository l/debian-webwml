<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the
Kolab Cyrus IMAP server does not properly restrict I/O buffering,
which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted
IMAP, LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-5+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-9.1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kolab-cyrus-imapd packages.</p>
