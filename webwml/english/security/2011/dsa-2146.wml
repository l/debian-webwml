<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>D. Fabian and L. Weichselbaum discovered a directory traversal 
vulnerability in MyDMS, a open-source document management system based 
on PHP and MySQL.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.0-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
no longer contain mydms packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mydms packages.</p>
