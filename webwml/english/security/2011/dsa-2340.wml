<define-tag description>weak password hashing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>magnum discovered that the blowfish password hashing used amongst
others in PostgreSQL contained a weakness that would give passwords
with 8 bit characters the same hash as weaker equivalents.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
postgresql-8.3 version 8.3.16-0lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
postgresql-8.4 version 8.4.9-0squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in postgresql-8.4 version 8.4.9-1,
postgresql-9.0 9.0.5-1 and postgresql-9.1 9.1~rc1-1.</p>

<p>The updates also include reliability improvements, originally scheduled
for inclusion into the next point release; for details see the respective
changelogs.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql packages.</p>
