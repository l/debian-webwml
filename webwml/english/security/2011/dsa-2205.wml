<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that GDM 3, the GNOME Display Manager,
does not properly drop privileges when manipulating files related to
the logged-in user.  As a result, local users can gain root
privileges.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a gdm3 package.
The gdm package is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30.5-6squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gdm3 packages.</p>
