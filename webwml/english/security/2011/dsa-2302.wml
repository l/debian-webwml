<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that the Bcfg2 server, a configuration management
server for Bcfg2 clients, is not properly sanitizing input from Bcfg2
clients before passing it to various shell commands.  This enables an
attacker in control of a Bcfg2 client to execute arbitrary commands on
the server with root privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5.7-1.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bcfg2 packages.</p>
