<define-tag description>ssl certificate blacklist update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update for the Iceape internet suite, an unbranded version of
Seamonkey, updates the certificate blacklist for several fraudulent
HTTPS certificates.</p>

<p>More details can be found in a <a
href="https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/ssl-tls-ca-tor-certificates-torbrowser">\
blog posting by Jacob Appelbaum of the Tor project</a>.
</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package only
provides the XPCOM code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.13-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.</p>
