<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lighttpd, a small and fast
webserver with minimal memory footprint.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4362">CVE-2011-4362</a>

  <p>Xi Wang discovered that the base64 decoding routine which is used to
  decode user input during an HTTP authentication, suffers of a signedness
  issue when processing user input.  As a result it is possible to force
  lighttpd to perform an out-of-bounds read which results in Denial of
  Service conditions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389">CVE-2011-3389</a>

  <p>When using CBC ciphers on an SSL enabled virtual host to communicate with
  certain client, a so called <q>BEAST</q> attack allows man-in-the-middle
  attackers to obtain plaintext HTTP traffic via a blockwise
  chosen-boundary attack (BCBA) on an HTTPS session.  Technically this is
  no lighttpd vulnerability.  However, lighttpd offers a workaround to
  mitigate this problem by providing a possibility to disable CBC ciphers.</p>

  <p>This updates includes this option by default. System administrators
  are advised to read the NEWS file of this update (as this may break older
  clients).</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.19-5+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.30-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.</p>
