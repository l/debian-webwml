<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Chromium browser.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0779">CVE-2011-0779</a>

  <p>Google Chrome before 9.0.597.84 does not properly handle a missing key in an
  extension, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (application crash) via a crafted extension.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1290">CVE-2011-1290</a>

  <p>Integer overflow in WebKit allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
  via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by Vincenzo Iozzo, Willem Pinckaers, and
  Ralf-Philipp Weinmann during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2011.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.472.63~r59945-5+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.648.133~r77742-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chromium-browser packages.</p>
