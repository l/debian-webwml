<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0446">CVE-2011-0446</a>

    <p>Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities when JavaScript
    encoding is used, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web
    script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0447">CVE-2011-0447</a>

    <p>Rails does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an
    X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers
    to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny0.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze0.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.11-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
