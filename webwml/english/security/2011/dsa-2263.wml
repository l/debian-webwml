<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Movable Type, a weblog publishing system,
contains several security vulnerabilities:</p>

<p>A remote attacker could execute arbitrary code in a logged-in users'
web browser.</p>

<p>A remote attacker could read or modify the contents in the system
under certain circumstances.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), no update is available at this
time.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.5+dfsg-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and for the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.6.1+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.</p>
