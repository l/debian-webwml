<p>Nelson Elhage discovered that incorrect memory handling during the
removal of ISA devices in KVM, a solution for full virtualization on
x86 hardware, could lead to denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
