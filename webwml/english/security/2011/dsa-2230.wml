<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in KVM, a solution for full
virtualization on x86 hardware:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0011">CVE-2011-0011</a>

   <p>Setting the VNC password to an empty string silently disabled
   all authentication.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1750">CVE-2011-1750</a>

   <p>The virtio-blk driver performed insufficient validation of
   read/write I/O from the guest instance, which could lead to
   denial of service or privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
