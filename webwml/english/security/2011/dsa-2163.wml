<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the django web development
framework:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0696">CVE-2011-0696</a>

    <p>For several reasons the internal CSRF protection was not used to
    validate ajax requests in the past. However, it was discovered that
    this exception can be exploited with a combination of browser plugins
    and redirects and thus is not sufficient.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0697">CVE-2011-0697</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the file upload form is prone to cross-site
    scripting attacks via the file name.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>It is important to note that this update introduces minor backward
incompatibilities due to the fixes for the above issues.
For the exact details, please see: <url http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/releases/1.2.5/>
