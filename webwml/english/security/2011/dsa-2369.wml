<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libsoup, a HTTP library implementation in C, is
not properly validating input when processing requests made to SoupServer.
A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access system files via a
directory traversal attack.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.1-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30.2-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.34.3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.34.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsoup2.4 packages.</p>
