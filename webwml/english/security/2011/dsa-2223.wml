<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Doctrine, a PHP library for implementing object
persistence, contains SQL injection vulnerabilities.
The exact impact depends on the application which uses the Doctrine
library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your doctrine packages.</p>
