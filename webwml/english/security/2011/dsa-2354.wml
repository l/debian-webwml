<p>Petr Sklenar and Tomas Hoger discovered that missing input sanitising in
the GIF decoder inside the CUPS printing system could lead to denial
of service or potentially arbitrary code execution through crafted GIF
files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.8-1+lenny10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distributions (sid), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.5.0-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
