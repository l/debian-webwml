<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libapache2-mod-authnz-external, an apache
authentication module, is prone to an SQL injection via the $user
parameter.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.4-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain
libapache2-mod-authnz-external.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.4-2.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-authnz-external packages.</p>
