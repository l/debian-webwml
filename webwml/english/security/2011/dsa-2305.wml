<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security issue have been discovered that affect vsftpd, a lightweight,
efficient FTP server written for security.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2189">CVE-2011-2189</a>

    <p>It was discovered that Linux kernels &lt; 2.6.35 are considerably slower in
    releasing than in the creation of network namespaces.  As a result of this
    and because vsftpd is using this feature as a security enhancement to
    provide network isolation for connections, it is possible to cause denial
    of service conditions due to excessive memory allocations by the kernel.
    This is technically no vsftpd flaw, but a kernel issue.  However, this
    feature has legitimate use cases and backporting the specific kernel patch
    is too intrusive.  Additionally, a local attacker requires the CAP_SYS_ADMIN
    capability to abuse this functionality.  Therefore, as a fix, a kernel
    version check has been added to vsftpd in order to disable this feature
    for kernels &lt; 2.6.35.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0762">CVE-2011-0762</a>

    <p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that vsftpd is incorrectly handling
    certain glob expressions in STAT commands.  This allows a remote authenticated
    attacker to conduct denial of service attacks (excessive CPU and process
    slot exhaustion) via crafted STAT commands.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-3+squeeze2.  Please note that 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2189">\
CVE-2011-2189</a> does not affect the lenny version.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vsftpd packages.</p>
