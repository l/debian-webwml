<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the TIFF manipulation and
conversion library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0191">CVE-2011-0191</a>

  <p>A buffer overflow allows to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service via a crafted TIFF image with JPEG encoding.
  This issue affects the Debian 5.0 Lenny package only.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0192">CVE-2011-0192</a>

  <p>A buffer overflow allows to execute arbitrary code or cause
  a denial of service via a crafted TIFF Internet Fax image
  file that has been compressed using CCITT Group 4 encoding.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1167">CVE-2011-1167</a>

  <p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the thunder (aka ThunderScan)
  decoder allows to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file that

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.8.2-11.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.9.4-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution, the first two problems have been fixed
in version 3.9.4-8, the last problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed
