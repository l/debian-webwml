<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1402">CVE-2011-1402</a>

  <p>It was discovered that previous versions of Mahara did not check user
  credentials before adding a secret URL to a view or suspending a user.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1403">CVE-2011-1403</a>

  <p>Due to a misconfiguration of the Pieform package in Mahara, the cross-site
  request forgery protection mechanism that Mahara relies on to harden its
  form was not working and was essentially disabled.
  This is a critical vulnerability which could allow attackers to trick other
  users (for example administrators) into performing malicious actions on
  behalf of the attacker. Most Mahara forms are vulnerable.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1404">CVE-2011-1404</a>

  <p>Many of the JSON structures returned by Mahara for its AJAX interactions
  included more information than what ought to be disclosed to the logged in
  user. New versions of Mahara limit this information to what is necessary for
  each page.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1405">CVE-2011-1405</a>

  <p>Previous versions of Mahara did not escape the contents of HTML emails sent
  to users. Depending on the filters enabled in one's mail reader, it could
  lead to cross-site scripting attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1406">CVE-2011-1406</a>

  <p>It has been pointed out to us that if Mahara is configured (through its
  wwwroot variable) to use HTTPS, it will happily let users login via the HTTP
  version of the site if the web server is configured to serve content over
  both protocol. The new version of Mahara will, when the wwwroot points to an
  HTTPS URL, automatically redirect to HTTPS if it detects that it is being
  run over HTTP.</p>

  <p>We recommend that sites wanting to run Mahara over HTTPS make sure that
  their web server configuration does not allow the serving of content over
  HTTP and merely redirects to the secure version. We also suggest that site
  administrators consider adding the <a
  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security">HSTS
  headers</a> to their web server configuration.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
