<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Rails, the Ruby web
application framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4214">CVE-2009-4214</a>

    <p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags function. An attacker may inject non-printable characters
    that certain browsers will then evaluate. This vulnerability only
    affects the oldstable distribution (lenny).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2930">CVE-2011-2930</a>

    <p>A SQL injection vulnerability had been found in the quote_table_name
    method that could allow malicious users to inject arbitrary SQL into a
    query.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2931">CVE-2011-2931</a>

    <p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability had been found in the
    strip_tags  helper. An parsing error can be exploited by an attacker,
    who can confuse the parser and may inject HTML tags into the output
    document.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3186">CVE-2011-3186</a>

    <p>A newline (CRLF) injection vulnerability had been found in
    response.rb. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via the
    Content-Type header.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
