<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Unbound, a recursive DNS resolver, would crash
when processing certain malformed DNS responses from authoritative DNS
servers, leading to denial of service.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4528">CVE-2011-4528</a>

	<p>Unbound attempts to free unallocated memory during processing
	of duplicate CNAME records in a signed zone.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4869">CVE-2011-4869</a>

	<p>Unbound does not properly process malformed responses which
	lack expected NSEC3 records.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1~lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unbound packages.</p>
