<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that python-webdav, a WebDAV server implementation,
contains several SQL injection vulnerabilities in the processing of
user credentials.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a python-webdav
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.9.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-webdav packages.</p>
