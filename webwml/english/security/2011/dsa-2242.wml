<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the STARTTLS implementation of the Cyrus IMAP
server does not properly restrict I/O buffering, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to insert commands into encrypted IMAP,
LMTP, NNTP and POP3 sessions by sending a cleartext command that is
processed after TLS is in place.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13p1-11 for cyrus-imapd-2.2 and in version 2.4.7-1
for cyrus-imapd-2.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.</p>
