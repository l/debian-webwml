<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulrik Persson reported a stack-based buffer overflow flaw in FontForge,
a font editor. When processed a crafted Bitmap Distribution Format (BDF)
FontForge could crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the user running FontForge.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20080429-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (squeeze), testing distribution (wheezy),
and unstable distribution (sid) are not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fontforge packages.</p>
