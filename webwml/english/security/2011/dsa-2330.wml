<define-tag description>XML encryption weakness</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Issues were found in the handling of XML encryption in simpleSAMLphp,
an application for federated authentication. The following two issues
have been addressed:</p>

<p>It may be possible to use an SP as an oracle to decrypt encrypted
messages sent to that SP.</p>

<p>It may be possible to use the SP as a key oracle which can be used
to forge messages from that SP by issuing 300000-2000000 queries to
the SP. </p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain simplesamlphp.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.</p>
