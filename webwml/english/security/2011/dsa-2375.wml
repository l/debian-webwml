<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the encryption support for BSD telnetd contains
a pre-authentication buffer overflow, which may enable remote
attackers who can connect to the Telnet port to execute arbitrary code
with root privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny7 of the krb5 package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.1-1.2 of the krb5-appl package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 and krb5-appl packages.</p>
