<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that pam-pgsql, a PAM module to authenticate using
a PostgreSQL database, was vulnerable to a buffer overflow in supplied
IP-addresses.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.1-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 0.7.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pam-pgsql packages.</p>
