<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered the distributed filesystem AFS:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0430">CVE-2011-0430</a>

   <p>Andrew Deason discovered that a double free in the Rx server
   process could lead to denial of service or the execution of
   arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0431">CVE-2011-0431</a>

   <p>It was discovered that insufficient error handling in the
   kernel module could lead to denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny4. Due to a technical problem with the
buildd infrastructure the update is not yet available, but will be
installed into the archive soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.14+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages. Note that in order
to apply this security update, you must rebuild the OpenAFS kernel module. </p>
