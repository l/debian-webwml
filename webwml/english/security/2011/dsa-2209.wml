<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Emmanuel Bouillon discovered a double free in tgt, the Linux SCSI target
user-space tools, which could lead to denial of service.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) doesn't include tgt.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.4-2squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tgt packages.</p>
