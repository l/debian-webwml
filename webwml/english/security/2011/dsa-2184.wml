<p>It was discovered that the ISC DHCPv6 server does not correctly
process requests which come from unexpected source addresses, leading
to an assertion failure and a daemon crash.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.1.1-P1-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.</p>
