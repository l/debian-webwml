<p>Paul McMillan, Mozilla and the Django core team discovered several
vulnerabilities in Django, a Python web framework:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4136">CVE-2011-4136</a>

  <p>When using memory-based sessions and caching, Django sessions are
  stored directly in the root namespace of the cache. When user data is
  stored in the same cache, a remote user may take over a session.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4137">CVE-2011-4137</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4138">CVE-2011-4138</a>

  <p>Django's field type URLfield by default checks supplied URL's by
  issuing a request to it, which doesn't time out. A Denial of Service
  is possible by supplying specially prepared URL's that keep the
  connection open indefinately or fill the Django's server memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4139">CVE-2011-4139</a>

  <p>Django used X-Forwarded-Host headers to construct full URL's. This
  header may not contain trusted input and could be used to poison the
  cache.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4140">CVE-2011-4140</a>

  <p>The CSRF protection mechanism in Django does not properly handle
  web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers,
  which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged
  requests.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
