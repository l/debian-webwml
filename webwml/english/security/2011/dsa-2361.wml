<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ChaSen, a Japanese morphological analysis
system, contains a buffer overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary
code execution in programs using the library.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.4-2+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.4-11+squeeze2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chasen packages.</p>
