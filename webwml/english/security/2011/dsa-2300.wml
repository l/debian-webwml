<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several unauthorised SSL certificates have been found in the wild issued
for the DigiNotar Certificate Authority, obtained through a security
compromise with said company. Debian, like other software
distributors, has as a precaution decided to disable the DigiNotar
Root CA by default in the NSS crypto libraries.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.11-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
