<p>It was discovered that Puppet, a centralized configuration management
solution, misgenerated certificates if the <q>certdnsnames</q> option was
used. This could lead to man in the middle attacks. More details are
available on the <a
href="http://puppetlabs.com/security/cve/cve-2011-3872/">Puppet web site</a>.
</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.24.5-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
