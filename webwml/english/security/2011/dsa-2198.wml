<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mathias Svensson discovered that tex-common, a package shipping a number
of scripts and configuration files necessary for TeX, contains insecure
settings for the <q>shell_escape_commands</q> directive.  Depending on the
scenario, this may result in arbitrary code execution when a victim is
tricked into processing a malicious tex-file or this is done in an
automated fashion.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem due
to <q>shell_escape</q> being disabled.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08.1.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tex-common packages.</p>
