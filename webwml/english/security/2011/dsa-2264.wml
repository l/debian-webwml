</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-26lenny3. Updates for arm and hppa are not yet available,
but will be released as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>             <th>Debian 5.0 (lenny)</th></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td>    <td>2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny3</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
These updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
Linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or <q>leap-frog</q> fashion.</p>
