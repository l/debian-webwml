<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that missing input sanitising in Freetype's processing
of CID-keyed fonts could lead to the execution of arbitrary code. </p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-2+lenny8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-2.1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
