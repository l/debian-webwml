<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the xrdb utility of x11-xserver-utils,
a X server resource database utility, is not properly filtering crafted
hostnames.  This allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with
root privileges given that either remote logins via xdmcp are allowed or
the attacker is able to place a rogue DHCP server into the victims network.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3+6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5+3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.6+2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your x11-xserver-utils packages.</p>
