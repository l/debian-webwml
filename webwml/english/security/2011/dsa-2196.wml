<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Witold Baryluk discovered that MaraDNS, a simple security-focused
Domain Name System server, may overflow an internal buffer when
handling requests with a large number of labels, causing a server
crash and the consequent denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.07.09-2.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze) and greater this problem had
already been fixed in version 1.4.03-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your maradns packages.</p>
