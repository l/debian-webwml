<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered that libxml was vulnerable to buffer overflows,
which allowed a crafted XML input file to potentially execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-5+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.</p>
