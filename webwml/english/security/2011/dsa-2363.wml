<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Tor, an online privacy tool, incorrectly computes
buffer sizes in certain cases involving SOCKS connections.  Malicious
parties could use this to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially 
allowing execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>In Tor's default configuration this issue can only be triggered by
clients that can connect to Tor's SOCKS port, which listens only on
localhost by default.</p>

<p>In non-default configurations where Tor's SocksPort listens not only on
localhost or where Tor was configured to use another SOCKS server for all of
its outgoing connections, Tor is vulnerable to a larger set of malicious
parties.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.32-1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1~squeeze+1.</p>

<p>For the unstable (sid) and testing (wheezy) distributions, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2.35-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, this problem has has fixed in
version 0.2.3.10-alpha-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>

<p>Please note that the update for stable (squeeze) updates this package
from 0.2.1.31 to 0.2.2.35, a new major release of Tor, as upstream has
announced end-of-life for the 0.2.1.x tree for the near future.  Please
check your Tor runs as expected after the upgrade.</p>
