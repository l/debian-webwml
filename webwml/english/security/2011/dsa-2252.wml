<p>It was discovered that the message header parser in the Dovecot mail
server parsed NUL characters incorrectly, which could lead to denial
of service through malformed mail headers.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.15-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.13-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.</p>
