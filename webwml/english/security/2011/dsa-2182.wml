<define-tag description>shell command injection</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dominik George discovered that Logwatch does not guard against shell
meta-characters in crafted log file names (such as those produced by
Samba).  As a result, an attacker might be able to execute shell
commands on the system running Logwatch.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20080702-2lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-1squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.3.6.cvs20090906-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your logwatch packages.</p>
