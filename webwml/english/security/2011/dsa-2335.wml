<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tim Starling discovered that the Debian-native CGI wrapper for man2html,
a program to convert UNIX man pages to HTML, is not properly escaping
user-supplied input when displaying various error messages.  A remote
attacker can exploit this flaw to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
attacks.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6f+repack-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6g-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your man2html packages.</p>
