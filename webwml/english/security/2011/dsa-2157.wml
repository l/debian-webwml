<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that PostgreSQL's intarray contrib module does not
properly handle integers with a large number of digits, leading to a
server crash and potentially arbitary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3.14-0lenny1 of the postgresql-8.3 package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.7-0squeeze1 of the postgresql-8.4 package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.7-1 of the postgresql-8.4 package and version 9.0.3-1 of
the postgresql-9.0 package.</p>

<p>The updates also include reliability improvements; for details see the
respective changelogs.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.</p>
