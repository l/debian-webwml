<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java SE platform.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0862">CVE-2011-0862</a>
	<p>Integer overflow errors in the JPEG and font parser allow
	untrusted code (including applets) to elevate its privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0864">CVE-2011-0864</a>
	<p>Hotspot, the just-in-time compiler in OpenJDK, mishandled
	certain byte code instructions, allowing untrusted code
	(including applets) to crash the virtual machine.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0865">CVE-2011-0865</a>
	<p>A race condition in signed object deserialization could
	allow untrusted code to modify signed content, apparently
	leaving its signature intact.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0867">CVE-2011-0867</a>
	<p>Untrusted code (including applets) could access information
	about network interfaces which was not intended to be public.
	(Note that the interface MAC address is still available to
	untrusted code.)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0868">CVE-2011-0868</a>
	<p>A float-to-long conversion could overflow, allowing
	untrusted code (including applets) to crash the virtual
	machine.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0869">CVE-2011-0869</a>
	<p>Untrusted code (including applets) could intercept HTTP
	requests by reconfiguring proxy settings through a SOAP
	connection.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0871">CVE-2011-0871</a>
	<p>Untrusted code (including applets) could elevate its
	privileges through the Swing MediaTracker code.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>In addition, this update removes support for the Zero/Shark and Cacao
Hotspot variants from the i386 and amd64 due to stability issues.
These Hotspot variants are included in the openjdk-6-jre-zero and
icedtea-6-jre-cacao packages, and these packages must be removed
during this update.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems will be fixed
in a separate DSA for technical reasons.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1~squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b18-1.8.9-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
