<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the Tag Image File Format (TIFF) library
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow triggered by a crafted OJPEG file
which allows for a crash and potentially execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 3.9.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
