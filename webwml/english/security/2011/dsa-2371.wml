<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two buffer overflows were discovered in JasPer, a library for handling 
JPEG-2000 images, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.900.1-5.1+lenny2. Due to technical limitations of the Debian
archive software, the oldstable update cannot be released synchronously
with the stable update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.900.1-7+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.</p>
