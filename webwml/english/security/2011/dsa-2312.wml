<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected. The iceape package
only provides the XPCOM code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-8. This update also marks the compromised DigiNotar
root certs as revoked rather then untrusted.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.</p>
