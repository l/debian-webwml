<p>It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, crashes while processing
certain sequences of recursive DNS queries, leading to a denial of
service.  Authoritative-only server configurations are not affected by
this issue.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
