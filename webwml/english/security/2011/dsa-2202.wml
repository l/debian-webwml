<define-tag description>failure to drop root privileges</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>MPM_ITK is an alternative Multi-Processing Module for Apache HTTPD that
is included in Debian's apache2 package.</p>

<p>A configuration parsing flaw has been found in MPM_ITK. If the
configuration directive NiceValue was set, but no AssignUserID directive
was specified, the requests would be processed as user and group root
instead of the default Apache user and group.</p>

<p>This issue does not affect the standard Apache HTTPD MPMs prefork,
worker, and event.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.2.17-2.</p>

<p>If you use apache2-mpm-itk, we recommend that you upgrade your apache2
packages.</p>
