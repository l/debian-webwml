<p>It was discovered that phpMyAdmin, a tool to administer MySQL over
the web, when the bookmarks feature is enabled, allowed to create a
bookmarked query which would be executed unintentionally by other users.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.11.8.1-5+lenny8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.3.7-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 4:3.3.9.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.</p>
