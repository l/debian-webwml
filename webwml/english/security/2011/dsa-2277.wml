<define-tag description>stack-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that xml-security-c, an implementation of the XML
Digital Signature and Encryption specifications, is not properly handling
RSA keys of sizes on the order of 8192 or more bits.  This allows an
attacker to crash applications using this functionality or potentially
execute arbitrary code by tricking an application into verifying a signature
created with a sufficiently long RSA key.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-3+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.</p>
