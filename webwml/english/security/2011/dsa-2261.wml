<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joernchen of Phenoelit discovered several vulnerabilities in Redmine,
a project management web application:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Logged in users may be able to access private data.</li>
  
  <li>The Textile formatter allowed for cross site scripting, exposing
  sensitive data to an attacker.</li>

  <li>The Bazaar repository adapter could be used to remotely execute
  commands on the host running Redmine.</li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain redmine packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your redmine packages.</p>
