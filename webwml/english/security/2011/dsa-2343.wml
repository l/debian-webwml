<define-tag description>CA trust revocation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several weak certificates were issued by Malaysian intermediate CA
<q>Digicert Sdn. Bhd.</q> This event, along with other issues, has lead to
Entrust Inc. and Verizon Cybertrust to revoke the CA's cross-signed
certificates.</p>

<p>This update to OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets Layer toolkit, reflects this
decision by marking Digicert Sdn. Bhd.'s certificates as revoked.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny14.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0e-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
