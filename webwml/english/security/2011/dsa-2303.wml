<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

    <p>Marek Kroemeke and Filip Palian discovered that uninitialized struct
    elements in the Bluetooth subsystem could lead to a leak of sensitive kernel
    memory through leaked stack memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2495">CVE-2011-2495</a> 

    <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the io file of a process' proc
    directory was world-readable, resulting in local information disclosure of
    information such as password lengths.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2496">CVE-2011-2496</a> 

    <p>Robert Swiecki discovered that mremap() could be abused for local denial of
    service by triggering a BUG_ON assert.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2497">CVE-2011-2497</a>

    <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered an integer underflow in the Bluetooth subsystem,
    which could lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2517">CVE-2011-2517</a> 

    <p>It was discovered that the netlink-based wireless configuration interface
    performed insufficient length validation when parsing SSIDs, resulting in
    buffer overflows. Local users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can cause a
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2525">CVE-2011-2525</a> 

    <p>Ben Pfaff reported an issue in the network scheduling code. A local user
    could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a
    specially crafted netlink message.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2700">CVE-2011-2700</a> 

    <p>Mauro Carvalho Chehab of Red Hat reported a buffer overflow issue in the
    driver for the Si4713 FM Radio Transmitter driver used by N900 devices.
    Local users could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or
    potentially gain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2723">CVE-2011-2723</a>

    <p>Brent Meshier reported an issue in the GRO (generic receive offload)
    implementation. This can be exploited by remote users to create a denial of
    service (system crash) in certain network device configurations.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2905">CVE-2011-2905</a> 

    <p>Christian Ohm discovered that the <q>perf</q> analysis tool searches for its
    config files in the current working directory. This could lead to denial of
    service or potential privilege escalation if a user with elevated privileges
    is tricked into running <q>perf</q> in a directory under the control of the
    attacker.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2909">CVE-2011-2909</a>

    the Comedi driver could lead to the information disclosure through 
    leaked stack memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2918">CVE-2011-2918</a> 

    <p>Vince Weaver discovered that incorrect handling of software event overflows
    in the <q>perf</q> analysis tool could lead to local denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2928">CVE-2011-2928</a>

    <p>Timo Warns discovered that insufficient validation of Be filesystem images
    could lead to local denial of service if a malformed filesystem image is
    mounted.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3188">CVE-2011-3188</a> 

    <p>Dan Kaminsky reported a weakness of the sequence number generation in the
    TCP protocol implementation. This can be used by remote attackers to inject
    packets into an active session.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3191">CVE-2011-3191</a>

    <p>Darren Lavender reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
    A malicious file server could cause memory corruption leading to a denial of
    service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also includes a fix for a regression introduced with the previous
security fix for <a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1768">CVE-2011-1768</a>
(<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=633738">\
Debian bug #633738</a>).
</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-35squeeze1. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

                                             <p>Debian 6.0 (squeeze)
