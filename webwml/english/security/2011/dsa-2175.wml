<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Volker Lendecke discovered that missing range checks in Samba's file
descriptor handling could lead to memory corruption, resulting in denial
of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.5-4lenny14.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
