<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aliz Hammond discovered that the MP4 decoder plugin of VLC, a multimedia
player and streamer, is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow.
This has been introduced by a wrong data type being used for a size
calculation.  An attacker could use this flaw to trick a victim into
opening a specially crafted MP4 file and possibly execute arbitrary code
or crash the media player.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.8-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
