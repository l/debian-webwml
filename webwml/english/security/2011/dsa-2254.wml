<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>OProfile is a performance profiling tool which is configurable by opcontrol, its
control utility. Stephane Chauveau reported several ways to inject arbitrary
commands in the arguments of this utility. If a local unprivileged user is
authorized by sudoers file to run opcontrol as root, this user could use the
flaw to escalate his privileges.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your oprofile packages.</p>
