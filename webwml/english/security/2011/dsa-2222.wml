<define-tag description>incorrect ACL processing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Christoph Martin discovered that incorrect ACL processing in TinyProxy,
a lightweight, non-caching, optionally anonymizing HTTP proxy, could
lead to unintended network access rights.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tinyproxy packages.</p>
