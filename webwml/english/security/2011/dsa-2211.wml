<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ricardo Narvaja discovered that missing input sanitising in VLC, a
multimedia player and streamer, could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code if a user is tricked into opening a malformed media file.</p>

<p>This update also provides updated packages for oldstable (lenny) for
vulnerabilities, which have already been addressed in Debian stable
(squeeze), either during the freeze or in <a href="dsa-2159">DSA-2159</a>
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0522">CVE-2010-0522</a>,
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1441">CVE-2010-1441</a>,
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1442">CVE-2010-1442</a> and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0531">CVE-2011-0531</a>).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6.h-4+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
