<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Stephane Chazelas discovered that the cronjob of the PHP 5 package in
Debian suffers from a race condition which might be used to remove
arbitrary files from a system (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0441">CVE-2011-0441</a>).</p>

<p>When upgrading your php5-common package take special care to <b>accept</b>
the changes to the /etc/cron.d/php5 file. Ignoring them would leave the
system vulnerable.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.6-1.</p>

<p>Additionally, the following vulnerabilities have also been fixed in the
oldstable distribution (lenny):</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3709">CVE-2010-3709</a>

    <p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the ZipArchive class
    may dereference a NULL pointer when extracting comments from a ZIP
    archive, leading to application crash and possible denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3710">CVE-2010-3710</a>

    <p>Stefan Neufeind discovered that the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL filter
    does not correctly handle long, to be validated, strings. Such
    crafted strings may lead to denial of service because of high memory
    consumption and application crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3870">CVE-2010-3870</a>

    <p>It was discovered that PHP does not correctly handle certain UTF-8
    sequences and may be used to bypass XSS protections.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4150">CVE-2010-4150</a>

    <p>Mateusz Kocielski discovered that the IMAP extension may try to
    free already freed memory when processing user credentials, leading
    to application crash and possibly arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
