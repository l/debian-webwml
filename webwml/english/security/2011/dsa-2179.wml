<p>Ansgar Burchardt discovered several vulnerabilities in DTC, a web
control panel for admin and accounting hosting services.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0434">CVE-2011-0434</a>
    <p>The bw_per_moth.php graph contains an SQL injection vulnerability.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0435">CVE-2011-0435</a>
    <p>Insufficient checks in bw_per_month.php can lead to bandwidth
    usage information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0436">CVE-2011-0436</a>
    <p>After a registration, passwords are sent in cleartext
    email messages.</p></li>

    <p>Authenticated users could delete accounts using an obsolete
    interface which was incorrectly included in the package.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update introduces a new configuration option which controls the
presence of cleartext passwords in email messages.  The default is not
to include cleartext passwords.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.29.17-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (squeeze) and the testing distribution
(wheezy) do not contain any dtc packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.32.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dtc packages.</p>
