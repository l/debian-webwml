<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two cross site scripting vulnerabilities were been discovered in
Mailman, a web-based mailing list manager. These allowed an attacker
to retrieve session cookies via inserting crafted JavaScript into
confirmation messages (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0707">CVE-2011-0707</a>) and in the list admin interface
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3089">CVE-2010-3089</a>; oldstable only).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1.11-11+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.13-5.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 1:2.1.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.</p>
