<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hossein Lotfi discovered an integer overflow in libsndfile's code to
parse Paris Audio files, which could potentially lead to the execution 
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.17-4+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.21-3+squeeze1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.25-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.</p>
