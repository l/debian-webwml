<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpLDAPadmin, a web based
interface for administering LDAP servers. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4074">CVE-2011-4074</a>

  <p>Input appended to the URL in cmd.php (when <q>cmd</q> is set to <q>_debug</q>) is
  not properly sanitised before being returned to the user. This can be
  exploited to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser
  session in context of an affected site.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4075">CVE-2011-4075</a>

  <p>Input passed to the <q>orderby</q> parameter in cmd.php (when <q>cmd</q> is set to
  <q>query_engine</q>, <q>query</q> is set to <q>none</q>, and <q>search</q> is set to e.g.
  <q>1</q>) is not properly sanitised in lib/functions.php before being used in a
  <q>create_function()</q> function call. This can be exploited to inject and
  execute arbitrary PHP code.</p></li>

</ul> 

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0.5-6+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.5-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin packages.</p>
