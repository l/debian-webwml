<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were found in the ACPI Daemon, the Advanced
Configuration and Power Interface event daemon:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1159">CVE-2011-1159</a>

    <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of OpenWall discovered that the socket handling
    is vulnerable to denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2777">CVE-2011-2777</a>

    <p>Oliver-Tobias Ripka discovered that incorrect process handling in
    the Debian-specific powerbtn.sh script could lead to local
    privilege escalation. This issue doesn't affect oldstable. The
    script is only shipped as an example in /usr/share/doc/acpid/examples.
    See /usr/share/doc/acpid/README.Debian for details.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4578">CVE-2011-4578</a>

    <p>Helmut Grohne and Michael Biebl discovered that acpid sets a umask
    of 0 when executing scripts, which could result in local privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-1lenny4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.7-1squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.</p>
