<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information leak.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

    the kernel to execute an infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2484">CVE-2011-2484</a>

    <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the number of exit handlers that
    a process can register is not capped, resulting in local denial of service
    through resource exhaustion (CPU time and memory).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2491">CVE-2011-2491</a>

    <p>Vasily Averin discovered an issue with the NFS locking implementation.  A
    malicious NFS server can cause a client to hang indefinitely in an unlock

    elements in the Bluetooth subsystem could lead to a leak of sensitive kernel
    memory through leaked stack memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2495">CVE-2011-2495</a>

    <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that the io file of a process' proc
    directory was world-readable, resulting in local information disclosure of
    information such as password lengths.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2496">CVE-2011-2496</a>

    <p>Robert Swiecki discovered that mremap() could be abused for local denial of

    <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered an integer underflow in the Bluetooth subsystem,
    which could lead to denial of service or privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2525">CVE-2011-2525</a>

    <p>Ben Pfaff reported an issue in the network scheduling code. A local user
    could cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by sending a
    specially crafted netlink message.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2928">CVE-2011-2928</a>

    TCP protocol implementation. This can be used by remote attackers to inject
    packets into an active session.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3191">CVE-2011-3191</a>

    <p>Darren Lavender reported an issue in the Common Internet File System (CIFS).
    A malicious file server could cause memory corruption leading to a denial of
    service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also includes a fix for a regression introduced with the previous
security fix for <a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1768">CVE-2011-1768</a>
(<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=633738">\
Debian bug #633738</a>).
</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.26-26lenny4. Updates for arm and alpha are not yet available, but will be
released as soon as possible. Updates for the hppa and ia64 architectures will
be included in the upcoming 5.0.9 point release.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th> <th>Debian 5.0 (lenny)</th></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td><td>2.6.26-1um-2+26lenny4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
These updates will not become active until after your system is rebooted.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
