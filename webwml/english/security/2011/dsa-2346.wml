<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in ProFTPD, an FTP server:</p>

<ul>

<li>(No CVE id)

        <p>ProFTPD incorrectly uses data from an unencrypted input buffer
        after encryption has been enabled with STARTTLS, an issue
        similar to 
        <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0411">\
        CVE-2011-0411</a>.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4130">CVE-2011-4130</a>
        <p>ProFTPD uses a response pool after freeing it under
        exceptional conditions, possibly leading to remote code
        execution.  (The version in lenny is not affected by this
        problem.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
