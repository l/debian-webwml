<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that the Quagga routing daemon contains two
denial-of-service vulnerabilities in its BGP implementation:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1674">CVE-2010-1674</a>

    <p>A crafted Extended Communities attribute triggers a NULL
    pointer dereference which causes the BGP daemon to crash.
    The crafted attributes are not propagated by the Internet
    core, so only explicitly configured direct peers are able
    to exploit this vulnerability in typical configurations.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1675">CVE-2010-1675</a>

    <p>The BGP daemon resets BGP sessions when it encounters
    malformed AS_PATHLIMIT attributes, introducing a distributed
    BGP session reset vulnerability which disrupts packet
    forwarding.  Such malformed attributes are propagated by the
    Internet core, and exploitation of this vulnerability is not
    restricted to directly configured BGP peers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This security update removes AS_PATHLIMIT processing from the BGP
implementation, preserving the configuration statements for backwards
compatibility.  (Standardization of this BGP extension was abandoned
long ago.)</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.10-1lenny5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.17-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
