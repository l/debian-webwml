<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that missing input sanitising in Freetype's glyph
handling could lead to memory corruption, resulting in denial of service
or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-2+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-2.1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
