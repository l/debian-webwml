<define-tag description>format string vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Exim, the default mail transport agent in
Debian, uses DKIM data obtain from DNS directly in a format string,
potentially allowing malicious mail senders to execute arbitrary code.
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1764">CVE-2011-1764</a>)</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem
because it does not contain DKIM support.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.72-6+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.75-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
