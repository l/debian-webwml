<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, a mail client
based on Thunderbird.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3647">CVE-2011-3647</a>
        <p>The JSSubScriptLoader does not properly handle
        XPCNativeWrappers during calls to the loadSubScript method in
        an add-on, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain
        privileges via a crafted web site that leverages certain
        unwrapping behavior.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3648">CVE-2011-3648</a>
	<p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote
	attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted
	text with Shift JIS encoding.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3650">CVE-2011-3650</a> 
        <p>Iceweasel does not properly handle JavaScript files that
	contain many functions, which allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
	application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
	via a crafted file that is accessed by debugging APIs, as
	demonstrated by Firebug.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.11-1+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.1.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
