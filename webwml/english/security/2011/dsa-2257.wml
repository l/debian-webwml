<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Rocco Calvi discovered that the XSPF playlist parser of VLC, a multimedia
player and streamer, is prone to an integer overflow resulting in a
heap-based buffer overflow.  This might allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening a specially crafted
file.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
