<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Java platform:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3389">CVE-2011-3389</a>

	<p>The TLS implementation does not guard properly against certain
	chosen-plaintext attacks when block ciphers are used in CBC
	mode.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3521">CVE-2011-3521</a>

	<p>The CORBA implementation contains a deserialization
	vulnerability in the IIOP implementation, allowing untrusted
	Java code (such as applets) to elevate its privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3544">CVE-2011-3544</a>

	<p>The Java scripting engine lacks necessary security manager
	checks, allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to
	elevate its privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3547">CVE-2011-3547</a>

	<p>The skip() method in java.io.InputStream uses a shared buffer,
	allowing untrusted Java code (such as applets) to access data
	that is skipped by other code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3548">CVE-2011-3548</a>

	<p>The java.awt.AWTKeyStroke class contains a flaw which allows
	untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
	privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3551">CVE-2011-3551</a>

	<p>The Java2D C code contains an integer overflow which results
	in a heap-based buffer overflow, potentially allowing
	untrusted Java code (such as applets) to elevate its
	privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3552">CVE-2011-3552</a>

	<p>Malicous Java code can use up an excessive amount of UDP
	ports, leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3553">CVE-2011-3553</a>

	<p>JAX-WS enables stack traces for certain server responses by
	default, potentially leaking sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3554">CVE-2011-3554</a>

	<p>JAR files in pack200 format are not properly checked for
	errors, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution when
	unpacking crafted pack200 files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3556">CVE-2011-3556</a>

	<p>The RMI Registry server lacks access restrictions on certain
	methods, allowing a remote client to execute arbitary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3557">CVE-2011-3557</a>

	<p>The RMI Registry server fails to properly restrict privileges
	of untrusted Java code, allowing RMI clients to elevate their
	privileges on the RMI Registry server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3560">CVE-2011-3560</a>

	<p>The com.sun.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection class does not perform
	proper security manager checks in the setSSLSocketFactory()
	method, allowing untrusted Java code to bypass security policy
	restrictions.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.10-0+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 6b23~pre11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
