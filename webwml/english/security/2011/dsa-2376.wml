Interface library and tools, used too wide permissions PID file,
which allows local users to kill arbitrary processes by writing to
this file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.9-2+squeeze1. (Although the version number contains the
string <q>squeeze</q>, this is in fact an update for lenny.)</p>

version 1.8.11-2+squeeze2.</p>
