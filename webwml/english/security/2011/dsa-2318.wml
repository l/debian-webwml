<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been discovered in cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
mail system designed for use in enterprise environments.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208">CVE-2011-3208</a>

    <p>Coverity discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the NNTP server
    implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd.  An attacker can exploit this
    flaw via several crafted NNTP commands to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3372">CVE-2011-3372</a>

    <p>Stefan Cornelius of Secunia Research discovered that the command processing
    of the NNTP server implementation (nttpd) of cyrus-imapd is not properly
    implementing access restrictions for certain commands and is not checking
    for a complete, successful authentication.  An attacker can use this flaw
    to bypass access restrictions for some commands and, e.g. exploit
    <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3208">CVE-2011-3208</a> without proper authentication.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-14+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2_2.2.13-19+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.</p>
