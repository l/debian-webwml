  (application crash) via vectors involving a "bad volume setting."</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0983">CVE-2011-0983</a>

  <p>Google Chrome before 9.0.597.94 does not properly handle anonymous blocks,
  which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have
