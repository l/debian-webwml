<p>It was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different
virtualization systems, is prone to an integer overflow (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2511">CVE-2011-2511</a>).
Additionally, the stable version is prone to a denial of service,
because its error reporting is not thread-safe (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1486">CVE-2011-1486</a>).</p>
