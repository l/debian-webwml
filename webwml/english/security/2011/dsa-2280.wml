<p>It was discovered that libvirt, a library for interfacing with different
virtualization systems, is prone to an integer overflow (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2511">CVE-2011-2511</a>).
Additionally, the stable version is prone to a denial of service,
because its error reporting is not thread-safe (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1486">CVE-2011-1486</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.6-10+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.2-7).</p>
