<p>A design flaw (<a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4345">CVE-2010-4345</a>)
in exim4 allowed the local Debian-exim user to obtain root privileges by
specifying an alternate configuration file using the -C option or by using the
macro override facility (-D option).  Unfortunately, fixing this vulnerability
is not possible without some changes in exim4's behvaviour. If you use the -C
or -D options or use the system filter facility, you should evaluate
the changes carefully and adjust your configuration accordingly. The
Debian default configuration is not affected by the changes.</p>

<p>The detailed list of changes is described in the NEWS.Debian file in
the packages. The relevant sections are also reproduced below.</p>

<p>In addition to that, missing error handling for the setuid/setgid
system calls allowed the Debian-exim user to cause root to append log data to
arbitrary files (<a
href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0017">CVE-2011-0017</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.69-9+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 4.72-4.</p>


<p>Excerpt from the NEWS.Debian file from the packages exim4-daemon-light
and exim4-daemon-heavy:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
Exim versions up to and including 4.72 are vulnerable to
CVE-2010-4345. This is a privilege escalation issue that allows the
exim user to gain root privileges by specifying an alternate
configuration file using the -C option. The macro override facility
(-D) might also be misused for this purpose.

In reaction to this security vulnerability upstream has made a number
of user visible changes. This package includes these changes.

If exim is invoked with the -C or -D option the daemon will not regain
root privileges though re-execution. This is usually necessary for
local delivery, though. Therefore it is generally not possible anymore
to run an exim daemon with -D or -C options.

However this version of exim has been built with
TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST=/etc/exim4/trusted_configs. TRUSTED_CONFIG_LIST
defines a list of configuration files which are trusted; if a config
file is owned by root and matches a pathname in the list, then it may
be invoked by the Exim build-time user without Exim relinquishing root
privileges.

As a hotfix to not break existing installations of mailscanner we have
also set WHITELIST_D_MACROS=OUTGOING. i.e. it is still possible to
start exim with -DOUTGOING while being able to do local deliveries.

If you previously were using -D switches you will need to change your
setup to use a separate configuration file. The ".include" mechanism
makes this easy.

The system filter is run as exim_user instead of root by default.  If
your setup requies root privileges when running the system filter you
will need to set the system_filter_user exim main configuration
option.
