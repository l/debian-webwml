<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, does not correctly process
certain UPDATE requests, resulting in a server crash and a denial of
service.  This vulnerability affects BIND installations even if they
do not actually use dynamic DNS updates.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R4+dfsg-0+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze3.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will be fixed later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
