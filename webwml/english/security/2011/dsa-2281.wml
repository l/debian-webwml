<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that opie, a system that makes it simple to use 
One-Time passwords in applications, is prone to a privilege escalation 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2490">CVE-2011-2490</a>) 
and an off-by-one error, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2489">CVE-2011-2489</a>). 
Adam Zabrocki and Maksymilian Arciemowicz also discovered another off-by-one 
error 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1938">CVE-2010-1938</a>), 
which only affects the lenny version as the fix was already included in 
squeeze.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32-10.2+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.32.dfsg.1-0.2+squeeze1</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid) do
not contain opie.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your opie packages.</p>
