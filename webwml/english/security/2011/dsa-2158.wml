<p>Michael Brooks (Sitewatch) discovered a reflective XSS flaw in
cgiirc, a web based IRC client, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary javascript.</p>

<p>For the old-stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.9-3lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cgiirc packages.</p>
