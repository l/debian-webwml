<p>Several problems have been discovered in MediaWiki, a website engine for
collaborative work.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1578">CVE-2011-1578</a> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1587">CVE-2011-1587</a>

 
   <p>Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, which
   affects Internet Explorer clients only, and only version 6 and
   earlier. Web server configuration changes are required to fix this
   issue. Upgrading MediaWiki will only be sufficient for people who use
   Apache with AllowOverride enabled.</p>

   <p>For details of the required configuration changes, see the <a

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1579">CVE-2011-1579</a>

   <p>Wikipedia user Suffusion of Yellow discovered a CSS validation error
   in the wikitext parser. This is an XSS issue for Internet Explorer
   clients, and a privacy loss issue for other clients since it allows
   the embedding of arbitrary remote images.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1580">CVE-2011-1580</a>

   <p>MediaWiki developer Happy-Melon discovered that the transwiki import
   feature neglected to perform access control checks on form submission.
   The transwiki import feature is disabled by default. If it is enabled,
   it allows wiki pages to be copied from a remote wiki listed in
   $wgImportSources. The issue means that any user can trigger such an
   import to occur.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4360">CVE-2011-4360</a>

   <p>Alexandre Emsenhuber discovered an issue where page titles on private
   wikis could be exposed bypassing different page ids to index.php. In the
   case of the user not having correct permissions, they will now be redirected
   to Special:BadTitle.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4361">CVE-2011-4361</a>

   <p>Tim Starling discovered that action=ajax requests were dispatched to the
   relevant function without any read permission checks being done. This could
   have led to data leakage on private wikis.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-2squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.5-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.</p>
