<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg coders, which are used
by MPlayer and other applications.</p>


<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3429">CVE-2010-3429</a>

  <p>Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano reported an arbitrary offset 
  dereference vulnerability in the libavcodec, in particular in the FLIC file 
  format parser. A specific FLIC file may exploit this vulnerability and execute
  arbitrary code. Mplayer is also affected by this problem, as well as other 
  software that use this library.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4704">CVE-2010-4704</a>

  <p>Greg Maxwell discovered an integer overflow the Vorbis decoder in FFmpeg. A 
  specific Ogg file may exploit this vulnerability and execute arbitrary code.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4705">CVE-2010-4705</a>

  <p>A potential integer overflow has been discovered in the Vorbis decoder in 
  FFmpeg.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>This upload also fixes an incomplete patch from DSA-2000-1. Michael Gilbert 
noticed that there was remaining vulnerabilities, which may cause a denial of 
service and potentially execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.svn20080206-18+lenny3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg-debian packages.</p>
