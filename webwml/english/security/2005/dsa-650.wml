<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered that due to missing input sanitising in
diatheke, a CGI script for making and browsing a bible website, it is
possible to execute arbitrary commands via a specially crafted URL.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your diatheke package.</p>
