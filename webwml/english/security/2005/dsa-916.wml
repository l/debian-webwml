<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Inkscape, a
vector-based drawing program.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3737">CVE-2005-3737</a>

    <p>Joxean Koret discovered a buffer overflow in the SVG parsing
    routines that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3885">CVE-2005-3885</a>

    <p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña noticed that the ps2epsi extension
    shell script uses a hardcoded temporary file making it vulnerable
    to symlink attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain inkscape packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.99.sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.42.2+0.43pre1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your inkscape package.</p>
