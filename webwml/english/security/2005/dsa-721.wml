<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michael Bhola discovered a bug in Squid, the popular WWW proxy cache.
Squid does not trigger a fatal error when it identifies missing or
invalid ACLs in the http_access configuration, which could lead to
less restrictive ACLs than intended by the administrator.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.9-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.</p>
