<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser of the Hardened-PHP Project reported a serious vulnerablility
in the third-party XML-RPC library included with some Drupal versions.  An
attacker could execute arbitrary PHP code on a target site.  This update
pulls in the latest XML-RPC version from upstream.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem since
no drupal is included.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.3-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal package.</p>
