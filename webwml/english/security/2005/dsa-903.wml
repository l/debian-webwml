<p>The unzip update in DSA 903 contained a regression so that symbolic
links that are resolved later in a zip archive aren't supported
anymore.  This update corrects this behaviour.  For completeness,
below please find the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting
code in unzip.  When decompressing a file in a directory an attacker
has access to, unzip could be tricked to set the file permissions to a
different file the user has permissions to.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-1woody5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip package.</p>
