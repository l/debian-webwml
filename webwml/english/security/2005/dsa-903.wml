<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting
code in unzip.  When decompressing a file in a directory an attacker
has access to, unzip could be tricked to set the file permissions to a
different file the user has permissions to.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-1woody4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip package.</p>
