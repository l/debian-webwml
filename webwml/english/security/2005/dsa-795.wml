<p>infamous42md reported that proftpd suffers from two format string
vulnerabilities. In the first, a user with the ability to create a
directory could trigger the format string error if there is a
proftpd shutdown message configured to use the "%C", "%R", or "%U"
variables. In the second, the error is triggered if mod_sql is used
to retrieve messages from a database and if format strings have been
inserted into the database by a user with permission to do so.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.10-15sarge1. There was an error in the packages originally
prepared for i386, which was corrected in 1.2.10-15sarge1.0.1 for i386.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.10-20.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd package.</p>
