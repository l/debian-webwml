<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several bugs were discovered in Clam AntiVirus, the antivirus scanner
for Unix, designed for integration with mail servers to perform
attachment scanning.  The following problems were identified:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2450">CAN-2005-2450</a>

    <p>Neel Mehta and Alex Wheeler discovered that Clam AntiVirus is
    vulnerable to integer overflows when handling the TNEF, CHM and
    FSG file formats.</p>

<li>CVE-NOMATCH

    <p>Mark Pizzolato fixed a possible infinete loop that could cause a
    denial of service.</p>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected as it doesn't contain clamav.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.86.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.</p>
