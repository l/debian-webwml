<p>Eduard Bloch discovered a bug in apt-cacher, a caching system for
Debian package and source files, that could allow remote attackers to
execute arbitrary commands on the caching host as user www-data.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt-cacher package.</p>
