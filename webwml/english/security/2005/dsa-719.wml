<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several format string problems have been discovered in prozilla, a
multi-threaded download accelerator, that can be exploited by a
malicious server to execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user
running prozilla.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.7.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your prozilla package.</p>
