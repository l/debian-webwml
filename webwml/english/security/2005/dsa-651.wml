<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the internet
object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0094">CAN-2005-0094</a>

    <p>"infamous41md" discovered a buffer overflow in the parser for
    Gopher responses which will lead to memory corruption and usually
    crash Squid.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0095">CAN-2005-0095</a>

    <p>"infamous41md" discovered an integer overflow in the receiver of
    WCCP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) messages.  An attacker
    could send a specially crafted UDP datagram that will cause Squid
    to crash.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
