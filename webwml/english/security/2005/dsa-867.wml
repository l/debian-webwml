<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eduard Bloch discovered that a rule file in module-assistant, a tool
to ease the creation of module packages, creates a temporary file in
an insecure fashion.  It is usually executed from other packages as
well.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a module-assistant
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your module-assistant package.</p>
