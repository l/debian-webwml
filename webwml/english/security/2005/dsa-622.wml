<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit Project
has discovered multiple insecure uses
of temporary files that could lead to overwriting arbitrary files via
a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 21.8-3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your htmlheadline package.</p>
