<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joxean Koret discovered that the Python SVG import plugin in dia, a
vector-oriented diagram editor, does not properly sanitise data read
from an SVG file and is hence vulnerable to execute arbitrary Python
code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.94.0-7sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.94.0-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dia package.</p>
