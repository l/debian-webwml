<p>"infamous42md" discovered that dhcpcd, a DHCP client for automatically
configuring IPv4 networking, can be tricked into reading past the end
of the supplied DHCP buffer which could lead to the daemon crashing.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.22pl4-21sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.22pl4-22.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dhcpcd package.</p>
