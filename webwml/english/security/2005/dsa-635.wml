<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Philip Hazel announced a buffer overflow in the host_aton function in
exim, the default mail-tranport-agent in Debian, which can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code via an illegal IPv6 address.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.35-1woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.36-13 of exim and 4.34-10 of exim4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim and exim4 packages.</p>
