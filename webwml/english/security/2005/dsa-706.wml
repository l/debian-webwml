<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
buffer overflow in axel, a light download accelerator.  When reading
remote input the program did not check if a part of the input can
overflow a buffer and maybe trigger the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0a-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0b-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your axel package.</p>
