<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in the sendmail program of
xmail, an advanced, fast and reliable ESMTP/POP3 mail server that
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with group mail
privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain xmail packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.22-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmail package.</p>
