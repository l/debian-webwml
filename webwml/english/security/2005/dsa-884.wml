<p>Mike O'Connor discovered that the default installation of Horde3 on
Debian includes an administrator account without a password.  Already
configured installations will not be altered by this update.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain horde3 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.4-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.5-2</p>

<p>We recommend that you verify your horde3 admin account if you have
installed Horde3.</p>
