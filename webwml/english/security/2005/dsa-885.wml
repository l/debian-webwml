<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenVPN, a free
virtual private network daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

    <p>A format string vulnerability has been discovered that could allow
    arbitrary code to be executed on the client.</p></li>

    <p>A NULL pointer dereferencing has been discovered that could be
    exploited to crash the service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openvpn package.</p>
