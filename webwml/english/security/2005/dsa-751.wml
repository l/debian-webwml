<define-tag description>IP spoofing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The upstream developers have discovered a bug in the DNS lookup code
of Squid, the popular WWW proxy cache.  When the DNS client UDP port
(assigned by the operating system at startup) is unfiltered and the
network is not protected from IP spoofing, malicious users can spoof
DNS lookups which could result in users being redirected to arbitrary
web sites.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has already been
fixed in version 2.5.9-9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has already been
fixed in version 2.5.9-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
