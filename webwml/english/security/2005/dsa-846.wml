<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cpio, a program to manage
archives of files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1111">CAN-2005-1111</a>

    <p>Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in setting the file
    permissions of files extracted from cpio archives.  A local
    attacker with write access to the target directory could exploit
    this to alter the permissions of arbitrary files the extracting
    user has write permissions for.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1229">CAN-2005-1229</a>

    <p>Imran Ghory discovered that cpio does not sanitise the path of
    extracted files even if the --no-absolute-filenames option was
    specified.  This can be exploited to install files in arbitrary
    locations where the extracting user has write permissions to.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.2-39woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cpio package.</p>
