<p>KDE security team discovered several vulnerabilities in the PCX and
other image file format readers in the KDE core libraries, some of
them exploitable to execute arbitrary code.  To a small extend the
packages in woody are affected as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-13.woody.14.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-5.</p>
