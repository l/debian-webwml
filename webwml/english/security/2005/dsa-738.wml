<p>A vulnerability was discovered in the way that Razor parses certain
email headers that could potentially be used to crash the Razor program,
causing a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.670-1sarge2. </p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this issue.</p>
