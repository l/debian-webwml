<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow in prozilla, a
multi-threaded download accelerator, which may be exploited to execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-3woody3.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (sarge) does not contain prozilla packages.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain prozilla packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your prozilla package.</p>
