<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ImageMagick, a
commonly used image manipulation library.  These problems can be
exploited by a carefully crafted graphic image.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0397">CAN-2005-0397</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy discovered a format string vulnerability in the
    filename handling code which allows a remote attacker to cause a
    denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0759">CAN-2005-0759</a>

    <p>Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a denial of service condition which
    can be caused by an invalid tag in a TIFF image.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0760">CAN-2005-0760</a>

    <p>Andrei Nigmatulin discovered that the TIFF decoder is vulnerable
    to accessing memory out of bounds which will result in a
    segmentation fault.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0762">CAN-2005-0762</a>

    <p>Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a buffer overflow in the SGI parser
    which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code via a
    specially crafted SGI image file.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-2.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick package.</p>
