<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sean Finney discovered several insecure temporary file uses in
toolchain-source, the GNU binutils and GCC source code and scripts.
These bugs can lead a local attacker with minimal knowledge to trick
the admin into overwriting arbitrary files via a symlink attack.  The
problems exist inside the Debian-specific tpkg-* scripts.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.4-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your toolchain-source package.</p>
