<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter Vreugdenhil discovered that awstats, a featureful web server log
analyser, passes user-supplied data to an eval() function, allowing
remote attackers to execute arbitrary Perl commands.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your awstats package.</p>
