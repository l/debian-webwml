<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An iDEFENSE researcher discovered two problems in the image processing
functions of PHP, a server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, of
which one is present in PHP3 as well.  When reading a JPEG image, PHP
can be tricked into an endless loop due to insufficient input
validation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.18-23.1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.18-31.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php3 package.</p>
