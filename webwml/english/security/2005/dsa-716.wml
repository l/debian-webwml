<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that certain malformed SNAC packets sent by
other AIM or ICQ users can trigger an infinite loop in Gaim, a
multi-protocol instant messaging client, and hence lead to a denial of
service of the client.</p>

<p>Two more denial of service conditions have been discovered in newer
versions of Gaim which are fixed in the package in sid but are not
present in the package in woody.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.58-2.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gaim packages.</p>
