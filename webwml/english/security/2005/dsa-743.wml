<p>Several problems have been discovered in ht, a viewer, editor and
analyser for various executables, that may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1545">CAN-2005-1545</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Team discovered an
    integer overflow in the ELF parser.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1546">CAN-2005-1546</a>

    <p>The authors have discovered a buffer overflow in the PE parser.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.5.0-1woody4.  For the HP Precision architecture, you are
advised not to use this package anymore since we cannot provide
updated packages as it doesn't compile anymore.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.0-2sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ht package.</p>
