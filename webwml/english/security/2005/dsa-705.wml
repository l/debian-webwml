<p>Several denial of service conditions have been discovered in wu-ftpd,
the popular FTP daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0256">CAN-2005-0256</a>

    <p>Adam Zabrocki discovered a denial of service condition in wu-ftpd
    that could be exploited by a remote user and cause the server to
    slow down by resource exhaustion.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0854">CAN-2003-0854</a>

    <p>Georgi Guninski discovered that /bin/ls may be called from within
    wu-ftpd in a way that will result in large memory consumption and
    hence slow down the server.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wu-ftpd package.</p>
