<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that the cvsbug program from CVS, which
serves the popular Concurrent Versions System, uses temporary files in
an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.1p1debian-13.</p>

<p>In the stable distribution (sarge) the cvs package does not expose the
cvsbug program anymore.</p>

<p>In the unstable distribution (sid) the cvs package does not expose the
cvsbug program anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvs package.</p>
