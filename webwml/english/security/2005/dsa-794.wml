<p>Justin Rye noticed that polygen generates precompiled grammar objects
world-writable, which can be exploited by a local attacker to at least
fill up the filesystem.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the polygen package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-7sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polygen package.</p>
