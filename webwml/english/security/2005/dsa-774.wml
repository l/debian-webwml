<p>Edward Shornock discovered a bug in the UIDL handling code of
fetchmail, a common POP3, APOP and IMAP mail fetching utility.  A
malicious POP3 server could exploit this problem and inject arbitrary
code that will be executed on the victim host.  If fetchmail is
running as root, this becomes a root exploit.</p>

<p>the old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5-12sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.</p>
