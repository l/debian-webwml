<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stephen Dranger discovered a buffer overflow in linpopup, an X11 port
of winpopup, running over Samba, that could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when displaying a maliciously crafted message.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linpopup package.</p>
