<p>Sven Tantau discovered a security problem in fuse, a filesystem in
userspace, that can be exploited by malicious, local users to disclose
potentially sensitive information.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the fuse package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fuse package.</p>
