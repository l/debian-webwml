<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jeroen van Wolffelaar discovered a problem in lintian, the Debian
package checker.  The program removes the working directory even if it
wasn't created at program start, removing an unrelated file or
directory a malicious user inserted via a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.20.17.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.23.6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lintian package.</p>
