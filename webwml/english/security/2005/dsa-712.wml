<p>Tim Dijkstra discovered a problem during the upgrade of geneweb, a
genealogy software with web interface.  The maintainer scripts
automatically converted files without checking their permissions and
content, which could lead to the modification of arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.06-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.10-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your geneweb package.</p>
