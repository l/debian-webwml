<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several insecure uses of temporary files have been discovered in
support scripts in the libc6 package which provides the c library for
a GNU/Linux system.  Trustix developers found that the catchsegv
script uses temporary files insecurely.  Openwall developers
discovered insecure temporary files in the glibcbug script.  These
scripts are vulnerable to a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.5-11.8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.2.ds1-20.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libc6 package.</p>
