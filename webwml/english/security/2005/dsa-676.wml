<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjölund discovered a buffer overflow in pcdsvgaview, an SVGA
PhotoCD viewer.  xpcd-svga is part of xpcd and uses svgalib to display
graphics on the Linux console for which root permissions are required.
A malicious user could overflow a fixed-size buffer and may cause the
program to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-8woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpcd-svga package immediately.</p>
