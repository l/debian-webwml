<p>Due to an error the last mailman update was slightly broken and had to
be corrected. This advisory only updates the packages updated with
DSA 674-1. For completeness below is the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two security related problems have been discovered in mailman,
web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1177">CAN-2004-1177</a>

    <p>Florian Weimer discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
    mailman's automatically generated error messages.  An attacker
    could craft an URL containing JavaScript (or other content
    embedded into HTML) which triggered a mailman error page that
    would include the malicious code verbatim.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0202">CAN-2005-0202</a>

    <p>Several listmasters have noticed unauthorised access to archives
    of private lists and the list configuration itself, including the
    users passwords.  Administrators are advised to check the
    webserver logfiles for requests that contain "/...../" and the
    path to the archives or configuration.  This does only seem to
    affect installations running on web servers that do not strip
    slashes, such as Apache 1.3.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1woody10.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailman package.</p>
