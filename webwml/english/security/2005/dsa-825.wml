<p>David Watson discovered a bug in mount as provided by util-linux and
other packages such as loop-aes-utils that allows local users to
bypass filesystem access restrictions by re-mounting it read-only.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain loop-aes-utils
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your loop-aes-utils package.</p>
