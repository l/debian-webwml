<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Danny Lungstrom discovered two buffer overflows in pcal, a program to
generate Postscript calendars, that could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when compiling a calendar.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7-8woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pcal package.</p>
