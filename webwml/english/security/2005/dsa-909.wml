<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Daniel Schreckling discovered that the MIME viewer in horde3, a web
application suite, does not always sanitise its input leaving a
possibility to force the return of malicious code that could be
executed on the vicitims machine.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain horde3 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.4-4sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 package.</p>
