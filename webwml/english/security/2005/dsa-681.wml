<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjölund and Devin Carraway discovered that synaesthesia, a
program for representing sounds visually, accesses user-controlled
configuration and mixer files with elevated privileges.  Thus, it is
possible to read arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1-2.1woody3.</p>

<p>For the testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem
does not exist since synaesthesia is not installed setuid root
anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your synaesthesia package.</p>
