<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gnump3d, a streaming
server for MP3 and OGG files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3349">CVE-2005-3349</a>

    <p>Ludwig Nussel discovered several temporary files that are created
    with predictable filenames in an insecure fashion and allows local
    attackers to craft symlink attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3355">CVE-2005-3355</a>

    <p>Ludwig Nussel discovered that the theme parameter to HTTP
    requests may be used for path traversal.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a gnump3d package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.3-1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnump3 package.</p>
