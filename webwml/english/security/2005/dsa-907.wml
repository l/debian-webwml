<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Akira Yoshiyama noticed that ipmenu, an cursel iptables/iproute2 GUI,
creates a temporary file in an insecure fashion allowing a local
attacker to overwrite arbitrary files utilising a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.3-4woody1</p>

<p>The stable distribution (sarge) does not contain the ipmenu package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.3-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ipmenu package.</p>
