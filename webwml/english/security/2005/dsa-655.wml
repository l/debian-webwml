<define-tag description>missing privilege release</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sj√∂lund discovered that zhcon, a fast console CJK system using
the Linux framebuffer, accesses a user-controlled configuration file
with elevated privileges.  Thus, it is possible to read arbitrary
files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2-4woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zhcon package.</p>
