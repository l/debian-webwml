<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered a temporary file vulnerability in a script
accompanied with MySQL, a popular database, that allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary SQL commands when the server is installed or
updated.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) as well as mysql-dfsg are not
affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.11a-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.12 for mysql-dfsg-4.1 and 5.0.11beta-3 of mysql-dfsg-5.0.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.</p>
