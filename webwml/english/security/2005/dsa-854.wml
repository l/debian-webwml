<define-tag description>infinite loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Simon Nielsen discovered that the BGP dissector in tcpdump, a powerful
tool for network monitoring and data acquisition, does not properly
handle a -1 return value from an internal function that decodes data
packets.  A specially crafted BGP packet can cause a denial of service
via an infinite loop.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-5sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump package.</p>
