<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jeroen van Wolffelaar noticed that the confirm add-on of SmartList,
the listmanager used on lists.debian.org, which is used on that host
as well, could be tricked to subscribe arbitrary addresses to the
lists.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.15-5.woody.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.15-18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smartlist package.</p>
