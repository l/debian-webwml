<define-tag description>pathname validation race</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A local user who has been granted permission to run commands via sudo
could run arbitrary commands as a privileged user due to a flaw in
sudo's pathname validation. This bug only affects configurations which
have restricted user configurations prior to an ALL directive in the
configuration file. A workaround is to move any ALL directives to the
beginning of the sudoers file; see the advisory at
<url http://www.sudo.ws/sudo/alerts/path_race.html /> for more information.</p>

<p>For the old stable Debian distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.6.6-1.3woody1.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution
(sarge), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.8p7-1.1sarge1.</p>

<p>Note that packages are not yet ready for certain architectures; these
will be released as they become available.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.</p>
