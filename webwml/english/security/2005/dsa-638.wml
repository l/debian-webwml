<p>"jaguar" has discovered two security relevant problems in gopherd, the
Gopher server in Debian which is part of the gopher package.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0560">CAN-2004-0560</a>

    <p>An integer overflow can happen when posting content of a specially
    calculated size.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0561">CAN-2004-0561</a>

    <p>A format string vulnerability has been found in the log routine.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.3woody2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain a gopherd package.
It has been replaced by Pygopherd.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gopherd package.</p>
