<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in osh, the
operator's shell for executing defined programs in a privileged
environment.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3347">CVE-2005-3347</a>

    <p>Charles Stevenson discovered a bug in the substitution of
    variables that allows a local attacker to open a root shell.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3533">CVE-2005-3533</a>

    <p>Solar Eclipse discovered a buffer overflow caused by the current
    working directory plus a filename that could be used to execute
    arbitrary code and e.g. open a root shell.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-11woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-13sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7-15, however, the package has been removed entirely.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your osh package.</p>
