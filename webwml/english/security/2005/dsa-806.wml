<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that the cvsbug program from gcvs, the
Graphical frontend for CVS, which serves the popular Concurrent
Versions System, uses temporary files in an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0a7-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0final-5sarge1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not expose the cvsbug program.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gcvs package.</p>
