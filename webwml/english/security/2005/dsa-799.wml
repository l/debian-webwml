<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A trivially-exploitable bug was discovered in webcalendar that
allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the HTTP daemon on a system running a vulnerable version.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the webcalendar
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.45-4sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webcalendar package immediately.</p>
