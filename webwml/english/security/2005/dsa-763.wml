<p>Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.</p>

<p>This problem does not affect the old stable distribution (woody).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.2-4.sarge.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-1. </p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zlib package.</p>
