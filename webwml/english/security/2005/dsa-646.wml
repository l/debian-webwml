<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrei Nigmatulin discovered a buffer overflow in the PSD
image-decoding module of ImageMagick, a commonly used image
manipulation library.  Remote exploitation with a carefully crafted
image could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
