<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"Vade 79" discovered that the BGP dissector in tcpdump, a powerful
tool for network monitoring and data acquisition, does not properly
handle RT_ROUTING_INFO.  A specially crafted BGP packet can cause a
denial of service via an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.2-2.9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump package.</p>
