<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered several format string vulnerabilities in the
movemail utility of Emacs, the well-known editor.  Via connecting to a
malicious POP server an attacker can execute arbitrary code under the
privileges of group mail.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 20.7-13.3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain an Emacs20 package
anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your emacs packages.</p>
