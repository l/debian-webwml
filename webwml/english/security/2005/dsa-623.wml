<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jonathan Rockway discovered a buffer overflow in nasm, the
general-purpose x86 assembler, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when compiling a maliciously crafted assembler source
file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.98.28cvs-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.98.38-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nasm package.</p>
