<p>Alexander Gerasiov discovered that phpldapadmin, a web based interface
for administering LDAP servers, allows anybody to access the LDAP
server anonymously, even if this is disabled in the configuration with
the "disable_anon_bind" statement.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6c-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin package.</p>
