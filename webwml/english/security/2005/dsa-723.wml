<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in the Xpm library which is used
in XFree86.  A remote attacker could provide a specially crafted XPM
image that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-16woody6</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-13, which is currently in preparation.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xfree86 and associated packages.</p>
