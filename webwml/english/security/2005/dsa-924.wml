<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kurt Fitzner discovered a buffer overflow in nbd, the network block
device client and server that could potentially allow arbitrary cod on
the NBD server.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2cvs20020320-3.woody.3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nbd-server package.</p>
