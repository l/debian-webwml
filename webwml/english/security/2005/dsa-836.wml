<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered insecure temporary file use
in cfengine2, a tool for configuring and maintaining networked
machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to overwrite
arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which is
probably root.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.14-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cfengine2 package.</p>
