<p>Due to restrictive dependency definition for fetchmail-ssl the updated fetchmailconf
package couldn't be installed on the old stable distribution (woody)
together with fetchmail-ssl.  Hence, this update loosens it, so that
the update can be pulled in.  For completeness we're including the
original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Thomas Wolff discovered that the fetchmailconf program which is
provided as part of fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3, APOP, IMAP mail
gatherer/forwarder, creates the new configuration in an insecure
fashion that can lead to leaking passwords for mail accounts to local
users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This update also fixes a regression in the package for stable caused
by the last security update.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.9.11-6.4 of fetchmail and in version 5.9.11-6.3 of
fetchmail-ssl.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5-12sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.</p>
