<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in ftpd-ssl, a simple BSD FTP
server with SSL encryption support, that could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain linux-ftpd-ssl
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.18+0.3-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.18+0.3-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ftpd-ssl package.</p>
