<p>SÃ¸ren Sandmann discovered a bug in memory allocation for pixmap images,
that can cause a crash of the X server or to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The update for the old stable distribution (woody) also contains a
different correction for multiple vulnerabilities in libXpm (<a
href="$(HOME)/security/2004/dsa-607">DSA 607</a>, <a
href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0914">CAN-2004-0914</a>,
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=309143">Bug#309143</a>),
since the old fix contained a regression.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-16woody7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.8.2.dfsg.1-7 of X.Org.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xfree86 and xorg packages.</p>
