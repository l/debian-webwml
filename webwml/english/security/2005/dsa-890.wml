<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered several security related problems in libungif4,
a shared library for GIF images.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2974">CVE-2005-2974</a>

    <p>Null pointer dereference, that could cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3350">CVE-2005-3350</a>

    <p>Out of bounds memory access that could cause a denial of service
    or the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.0b1-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libungif4 packages.</p>
