<p>Remco Verhoef has discovered a vulnerability in acidlab, Analysis
Console for Intrusion Databases, and in acidbase, Basic Analysis and
Security Engine, which can be exploited by malicious users to conduct
SQL injection attacks.</p>

<p>The maintainers of Analysis Console for Intrusion Databases (ACID) in Debian,
of which BASE is a fork off, after a security audit of both BASE and ACID
have determined that the flaw found not only affected the base_qry_main.php (in
BASE) or acid_qry_main.php (in ACID) component but was also found in other
elements of the consoles due to improper parameter validation and filtering.</p>

<p>All the SQL injection bugs and Cross Site Scripting bugs found have been
fixed in the Debian package, closing all the different attack vendors detected.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-2.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-10.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6b20-13 and in version 1.2.1-1 of acidbase.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your acidlab and acidbase package.</p>
