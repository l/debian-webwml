<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in bzip2, a high-quality
block-sorting file compressor and decompressor.  When decompressing a
file in a directory an attacker has access to, bunzip2 could be
tricked to set the file permissions to a different file the user has
permissions to.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1.woody2</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bzip2 packages.</p>
