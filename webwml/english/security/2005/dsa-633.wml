<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter Samuelson, upstream maintainer of bmv, a PostScript viewer for
SVGAlib, discovered that temporary files are created in an insecure
fashion.  A malicious local user could cause arbitrary files to be
overwritten by a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2-14.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-17.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bmv packages.</p>
