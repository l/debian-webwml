<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in the MIT Kerberos 5
administration library (libkadm5srv) that could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code upon exploitation by an authenticated user, not
necessarily one with administrative privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-5woody7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
