<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
cross-site scripting problem in mailreader, a simple, but powerful WWW
mail reader system, when displaying messages of the MIME types
text/enriched or text/richtext.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.29-5woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.29-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailreader package.</p>
