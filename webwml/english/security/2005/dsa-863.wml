<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
format string vulnerability in the CDDB processing component of
xine-lib, the xine video/media player library, that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code caused by a malicious CDDB entry.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8-2woody4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxine0 and libxine1 packages.</p>
