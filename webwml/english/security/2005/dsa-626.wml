<p>Dmitry V. Levin discovered a buffer overflow in libtiff, the Tag Image
File Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  Upon reading
a TIFF file it is possible to crash the application, and maybe also to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6.woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.</p>
