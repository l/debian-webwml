<p>zsync, a file transfer program, includes a modified local copy of
the zlib library, and is vulnerable to certain bugs fixed previously
in the zlib package.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the zsync
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3-1.sarge.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.0-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zsync package.</p>
