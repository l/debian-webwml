<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered an integer overflow in a helper application
inside of Evolution, a free grouware suite.  A local attacker could
cause the setuid root helper to execute arbitrary code with elevated
privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.5-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your evolution package.</p>
