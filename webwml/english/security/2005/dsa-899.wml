<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in egroupware, a
web-based groupware suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0870">CVE-2005-0870</a>

    <p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered several cross site scripting
    problems in phpsysinfo, which are also present in the imported
    version in egroupware and of which not all were fixed in
    DSA <a href="dsa-724">724</a>.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2600">CVE-2005-2600</a>

    <p>Alexander Heidenreich discovered a cross-site scripting problem in
    the tree view of FUD Forum Bulletin Board Software, which is also
    present in egroupware and allows remote attackers to read private
    posts via a modified mid parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3347">CVE-2005-3347</a>

    <p>Christopher Kunz discovered that local variables get overwritten
    unconditionally in phpsysinfo, which are also present in
    egroupware, and are trusted later, which could lead to the
    inclusion of arbitrary files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3348">CVE-2005-3348</a>

    <p>Christopher Kunz discovered that user-supplied input is used
    unsanitised in phpsysinfo and imported in egroupware, causing a
    HTTP Response splitting problem.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain egroupware packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0.007-2.dfsg-2sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0.009.dfsg-3-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your egroupware packages.</p>
