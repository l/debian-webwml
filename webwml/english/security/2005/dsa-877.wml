<p>Steve Kemp discovered two vulnerabilities in gnump3d, a streaming
server for MP3 and OGG files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3122">CVE-2005-3122</a>

    <p>The 404 error page does not strip malicious javascript content
    from the resulting page, which would be executed in the victims
    browser.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3123">CVE-2005-3123</a>

    <p>By using specially crafting URLs it is possible to read arbitary
    files to which the user of the streaming server has access to.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a gnump3d package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.3-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnump3d package.</p>
