<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered that a script of lm-sensors,
utilities to read temperature/voltage/fan sensors, creates a temporary
file with a predictable filename, leaving it vulnerable for a symlink
attack.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lm-sensors package.</p>
