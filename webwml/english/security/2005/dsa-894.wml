<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discoverd several buffer overflows in the RTF import
mechanism of AbiWord, a WYSIWYG word processor based on GTK 2.
Opening a specially crafted RTF file could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2+cvs.2002.06.05-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.7-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your abiword package.</p>
