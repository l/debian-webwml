<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered insecure temporary file
creation in graphviz, a rich set of graph drawing tools, that can be
exploited to overwrite arbitrary files by a local attacker.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem probably persists
but the package is non-free.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz package.</p>
