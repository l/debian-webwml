<p>Eric Romang discovered several insecure temporary file creations in
heartbeat, the subsystem for High-Availability Linux.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.9.0l-7.3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-9sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heartbeat package.</p>
