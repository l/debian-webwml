<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities have been identified in the
helix-player media player that could allow an attacker to execute code
on the victim's machine via specially crafted network resources.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1766">CAN-2005-1766</a>

        <p>Buffer overflow in the RealText parser could allow remote code
        execution via a specially crafted RealMedia file with a long
        RealText string.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2710">CAN-2005-2710</a>

        <p>Format string vulnerability in Real HelixPlayer and RealPlayer 10
        allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the image
        handle attribute in a RealPix (.rp) or RealText (.rt) file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1sarge1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your helix-player package.</p>
<p>helix-player was distributed only on the i386 and powerpc architectures</p>
