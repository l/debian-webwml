<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sylvain Defresne discovered a buffer overflow in libexif, a library
that parses EXIF files (such as JPEG files with extra tags).  This bug
could be exploited to crash the application and maybe to execute
arbitrary code as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.0-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.9-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libexif package.</p>
