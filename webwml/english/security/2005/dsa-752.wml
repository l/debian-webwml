<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two problems have been discovered in gzip, the GNU compression
utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0988">CAN-2005-0988</a>

    <p>Imran Ghory discovered a race condition in the permissions setting
    code in gzip.  When decompressing a file in a directory an
    attacker has access to, gunzip could be tricked to set the file
    permissions to a different file the user has permissions to.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1228">CAN-2005-1228</a>

    <p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered a path traversal vulnerability in
    gunzip.  When gunzip is used with the -N option an attacker could
    use
    this vulnerability to create files in an arbitrary directory with
    the permissions of the user.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-3woody5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-10.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gzip package.</p>
