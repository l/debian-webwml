<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Python development team has discovered a flaw in their language
package.  The SimpleXMLRPCServer library module could permit remote
attackers unintended access to internals of the registered object or
its module or possibly other modules.  The flaw only affects Python
XML-RPC servers that use the register_instance() method to register an
object without a _dispatch() method.  Servers using only
register_function() are not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4.7.  No other version of Python in woody is affected.</p>

<p>For the testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions the following
matrix explains which version will contain the correction in which
version:</p>

  <tr>
    <th>&nbsp;</th>
    <th>testing</th>
    <th>unstable</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Python 2.2</td>
    <td>2.2.3-14</td>
    <td>2.2.3-14</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Python 2.3</td>
    <td>2.3.4-20</td>
    <td>2.3.4+2.3.5c1-2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Python 2.4</td>
    <td>2.4-5</td>
    <td>2.4-5</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Python packages.</p>
