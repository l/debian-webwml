<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the Apache web server.  When it
is acting as an HTTP proxy, it allows remote attackers to poison the
web cache, bypass web application firewall protection, and conduct
cross-site scripting attacks, which causes Apache to incorrectly
handle and forward the body of the request.</p>

<p>The fix for this bug is contained in the apache-common package which means
that there isn't any need for a separate update of the apache-perl and
apache-ssl package.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.26-0woody7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.33-6sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.33-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Apache package.</p>
