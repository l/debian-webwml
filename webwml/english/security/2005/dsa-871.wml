<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered two format string vulnerabilities in libgda2,
the GNOME Data Access library for GNOME2, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code in programs that use this library.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgda2 packages.</p>
