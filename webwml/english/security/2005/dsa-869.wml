<p>The developers of eric, a full featured Python IDE, have fixed a bug
in the processing of project files that could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an eric package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.2-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eric package.</p>
