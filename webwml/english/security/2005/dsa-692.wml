<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The KDE team fixed a bug in kppp in 2002 which was now discovered to be
exploitable by iDEFENSE.  By opening a sufficiently large number of
file descriptors before executing kppp which is installed setuid root a
local attacker is able to take over privileged file descriptors.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-14.7.</p>

<p>The testing (sarge) and unstable (sid) distributions are not affected
since KDE 3.2 already contained the correction.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kppp package.</p>
