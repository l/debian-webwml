<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Clam AntiVirus, the
antivirus scanner for Unix, designed for integration with mail servers
to perform attachment scanning.  The following problems were
identified:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2919">CAN-2005-2919</a>

    <p>A potentially infinite loop could lead to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2920">CAN-2005-2920</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow could lead to a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain ClamAV packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.87-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.</p>
