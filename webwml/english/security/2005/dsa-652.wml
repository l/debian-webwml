<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in unarj, a non-free ARJ
unarchive utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0947">CAN-2004-0947</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow has been discovered when handling long file
    names contained in an archive.  An attacker could create a
    specially crafted archive which could cause unarj to crash or
    possibly execute arbitrary code when being extracted by a victim.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1027">CAN-2004-1027</a>

    <p>A directory traversal vulnerability has been found so that an
    attacker could create a specially crafted archive which would
    create files in the parent directory when being extracted by a
    victim.  When used recursively, this vulnerability could be used
    to overwrite critical system files and programs.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.43-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems don't apply since
unstable/non-free does not contain the unarj package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unarj package.</p>
