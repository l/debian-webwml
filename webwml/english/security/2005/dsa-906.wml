<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Colin Leroy discovered several buffer overflows in a number of
importer routines in sylpheed, a light-weight e-mail client with GTK+,
that could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The following matrix explains which versions fix this vulnerability</p>

<div class="centerdiv">

    <th>old stable (woody)</th>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sylpheed package.</p>
