<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the internet
object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0173">CAN-2005-0173</a>

    <p>LDAP is very forgiving about spaces in search filters and this
    could be abused to log in using several variants of the login
    name, possibly bypassing explicit access controls or confusing
    accounting.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0175">CAN-2005-0175</a>

    <p>Cache pollution/poisening via HTTP response splitting has been
    discovered.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0194">CAN-2005-0194</a>

    <p>The meaning of the access controls becomes somewhat confusing if
    any of the referenced ACLs (access control lists) is declared
    empty, without any members.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0211">CAN-2005-0211</a>

    <p>The length argument of the WCCP recvfrom() call is larger than it
    should be.  An attacker may send a larger than normal WCCP packet
    that could overflow a buffer.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
