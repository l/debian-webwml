<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update only covers binary packages for the big endian MIPS
architecture that was mysteriously forgotton in the earlier update.
For completeness below is the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A stack-based buffer overflow in the init_syms function of MySQL, a
popular database, has been discovered that allows remote authenticated
users who can create user-defined functions to execute arbitrary code
via a long function_name field.  The ability to create user-defined
functions is not typically granted to untrusted users.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following vulnerability matrix explains which version of MySQL in
which distribution has this problem fixed:</p>

    <td>n/a</td>
    <td>n/a</td>

  </tr><p>
</table>
</center>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-4.1 packages.</p>
