<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Greg Roelofs discovered and fixed several buffer overflows in pnmtopng
which is also included in netpbm, a collection of graphic conversion
utilities, that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code via a
specially crafted PNM file.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 9.20-8.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0-8sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in
version 10.0-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm package.</p>
