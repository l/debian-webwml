<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
problem in typespeed, a touch-typist trainer disguised as game.  This
could lead to a local attacker executing arbitrary code as group
games.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.1-2.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typespeed package.</p>
