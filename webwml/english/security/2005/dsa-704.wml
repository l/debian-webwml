<define-tag description>tempfile, missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jens Steube discovered several vulnerabilities in remstats, the remote
statistics system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0387">CAN-2005-0387</a>

    <p>When processing uptime data on the unix-server a temporary file is
    opened in an insecure fashion which could be used for a symlink
    attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the permissions
    of the remstats user.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0388">CAN-2005-0388</a>

    <p>The remoteping service can be exploited to execute arbitrary
    commands due to missing input sanitising.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.00a4-8woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.13a-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your remstats packages.</p>
