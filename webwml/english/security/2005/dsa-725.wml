<define-tag description>missing privilege release</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jens Steube discovered that ppxp, yet another PPP program, does not
release root privileges when opening potentially user supplied log
files.  This can be tricked into opening a root shell.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2001080415-6woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2001080415-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ppxp package.</p>
