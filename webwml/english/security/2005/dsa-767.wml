<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcin Slusarz discovered two integer overflow vulnerabilities in
libgadu, a library provided and used by ekg, a console Gadu Gadu
client, an instant messaging program, that could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The library is also used by other packages such as kopete, which
should be restarted to take effect of this update.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an ekg package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5+20050411-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5+20050718+1.6rc3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ekg package.</p>
