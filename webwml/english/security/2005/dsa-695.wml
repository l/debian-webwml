<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in xli, an image viewer
for X11.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0775">CAN-2001-0775</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in the decoder for FACES format images could be
    exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code.  This problem
    has been fixed in xloadimage in DSA 069 already.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0638">CAN-2005-0638</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy of the Gentoo Linux Security Audit Team has reported
    a flaw in the handling of compressed images, where shell
    meta-characters are not adequately escaped.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0639">CAN-2005-0639</a>

    <p>Insufficient validation of image properties in have been
    discovered which could potentially result in buffer management
    errors.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-11woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xli package.</p>
