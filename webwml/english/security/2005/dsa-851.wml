<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in openvpn, a
Virtual Private Network daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2531">CAN-2005-2531</a>

    <p>Wrong processing of failed certificate authentication when running
    with "verb 0" and without TLS authentication can lead to a denial
    of service by disconnecting the wrong client.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2532">CAN-2005-2532</a>

    <p>Wrong handling of packets that can't be decrypted on the server
    can lead to the disconnection of unrelated clients.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2533">CAN-2005-2533</a>

    <p>When running in "dev tap" Ethernet bridging mode, openvpn can
    exhaust its memory by receiving a large number of spoofed MAC
    addresses and hence denying service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2534">CAN-2005-2534</a>

    <p>Simultaneous TCP connections from multiple clients with the same
    client certificate can cause a denial of service when
    <code>--duplicate-cn</code> is not enabled.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openvpn package.</p>
