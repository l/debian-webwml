<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ARC archive program
under Unix.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2945">CAN-2005-2945</a>

    <p>Eric Romang discovered that the ARC archive program under Unix
    creates a temporary file with insecure permissions which may lead
    to an attacker stealing sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2992">CAN-2005-2992</a>

    <p>Joey Schulze discovered that the temporary file was created in an
    insecure fashion as well, leaving it open to a classic symlink
    attack.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain arc packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.21l-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.21m-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your arc package.</p>
