<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjölund discovered that programs linked against xview are
vulnerable to a number of buffer overflows in the XView library.  When
the overflow is triggered in a program which is installed setuid root
a malicious user could perhaps execute arbitrary code as privileged
user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2p1.4-16woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2p1.4-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xview packages.</p>
