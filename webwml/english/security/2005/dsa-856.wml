<p>Arc Riley discovered that py2play, a peer-to-peer network game engine,
is able to execute arbitrary code received from the p2p game network
it is connected to without any security checks.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain py2play packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.7-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your py2play package.</p>
