<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The upstream developer of curl, a multi-protocol file transfer
library, informed us that the former correction to several off-by-one
errors are not sufficient.  For completeness please find the original
bug description below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several problems were discovered in libcurl, a multi-protocol file
transfer library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3185">CVE-2005-3185</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in libcurl
    that could allow the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4077">CVE-2005-4077</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered several off-by-one errors that allows
    local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of
    service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs.</p></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.9.5-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.13.2-2sarge5.  This update also includes a bugfix against
data corruption.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.15.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcurl packages.</p>
