<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>KDE developers have reported a vulnerability in the backup file
handling of Kate and Kwrite.  The backup files are created with
default permissions, even if the original file had more strict
permissions set.  This could disclose information unintendedly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-6.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kate package.</p>
