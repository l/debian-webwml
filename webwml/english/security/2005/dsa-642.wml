<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gallery, a web-based
photo album written in PHP4.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1106">CAN-2004-1106</a>

    <p>Jim Paris discovered a cross site scripting vulnerability which
    allows code to be inserted by using specially formed URLs.</p>

<li>CVE-NOMATCH

    <p>The upstream developers of gallery have fixed several cases of
    possible variable injection that could trick gallery to unintended
    actions, e.g. leaking database passwords.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5-8woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-pl4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gallery package.</p>
