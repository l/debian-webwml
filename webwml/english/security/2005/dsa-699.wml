<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of
the LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  This can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.17+0.1-2woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.17.24+0.1-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your telnet-ssl package.</p>
