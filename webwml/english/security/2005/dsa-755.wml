<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Frank Warmerdam discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in libtiff,
the Tag Image File Format library for processing TIFF graphics files
that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code via malformed TIFF
files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-7</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.</p>
