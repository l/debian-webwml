<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjölund discovered several bugs in ncpfs that provides utilities
to use resources from NetWare servers of which one also applies to the
stable Debian distribution.  Due to accessing a configuration file
without further checks with root permissions it is possible to read
arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0.18-10woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ncpfs package.</p>
