<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Henryk Plötz discovered a vulnerability in bluez-utils, tools and
daemons for Bluetooth.  Due to missing input sanitising it is possible
for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands supplied as device name
from the remote device.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem
since it doesn't contain bluez-utils packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.15-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.19-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bluez-utils package.</p>
