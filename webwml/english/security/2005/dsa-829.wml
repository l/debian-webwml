<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A stack-based buffer overflow in the init_syms function of MySQL, a
popular database, has been discovered that allows remote authenticated
users who can create user-defined functions to execute arbitrary code
via a long function_name field.  The ability to create user-defined
functions is not typically granted to untrusted users.</p>

<p>The following vulnerability matrix shows which version of MySQL in
which distribution has this problem fixed:</p>
