<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered that langen2kvhtml from the
kvoctrain package from the kdeedu suite creates temporary files in an
insecure fashion.  This leaves them open for symlink attacks.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2-3.sarge.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvoctrain package.</p>
