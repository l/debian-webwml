<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>SuSE developers discovered that ntp confuses the given group id with
the group id of the given user when called with a group id on the
commandline that is specified as a string and not as a numeric gid,
which causes ntpd to run with different privileges than intended.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.0a+stable-2sarge1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntp-server package.</p>
