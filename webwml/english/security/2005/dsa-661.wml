<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that f2c and fc, which are both part of the f2c package, a
fortran 77 to C/C++ translator, open temporary files insecurely and
are hence vulnerable to a symlink attack.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0017">CAN-2005-0017</a>

    <p>Multiple insecure temporary files in the f2c translator.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0018">CAN-2005-0018</a>

    <p>Two insecure temporary files in the f2 shell script.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 20010821-3.1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your f2c package.</p>
