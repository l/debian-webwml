<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ariel Berkman discovered several buffer overflows in xloadimage, which
are also present in xli, a command line utility for viewing images in
X11, and could be exploited via large image titles and cause the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-11woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.0-18sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xli package.</p>
