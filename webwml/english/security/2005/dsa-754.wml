<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered that centericq, a text-mode multi-protocol
instant messenger client, creates some temporary files with
predictable filenames and is hence vulnerable to symlink attacks by
local attackers.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.20.0-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.20.0-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your centericq package.</p>
