<p>Erik Sj√∂lund discovered that hztty, a converter for GB, Big5 and zW/HZ
Chinese encodings in a tty session, can be triggered to execute
arbitrary commands with group utmp privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0-5.2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0-6.1.</p>
