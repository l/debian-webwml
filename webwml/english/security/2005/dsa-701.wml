<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the smb daemon from
Samba, a LanManager like file and printer server for GNU/Linux and
Unix-like systems.  Requesting a very large number of access control
descriptors from the server could exploit the integer overflow, which
may result in a buffer overflow which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code with root privileges.  Upstream developers have
discovered more possible integer overflows that are fixed with this
update as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3a-14.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
