<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered several insecure temporary
file uses in cfengine, a tool for configuring and maintaining
networked machines, that can be exploited by a symlink attack to
overwrite arbitrary files owned by the user executing cfengine, which
is probably root.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-9woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cfengine package.</p>
