<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered an insecurely created temporary file in
apachetop, a realtime monitoring tool for the Apache webserver that
could be exploited with a symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files
with the user id that runs apachetop.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apachetop package.</p>
