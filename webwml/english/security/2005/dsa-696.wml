<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo discovered another vulnerability in the File::Path::rmtree
function of perl, the popular scripting language.  When a process is
deleting a directory tree, a different user could exploit a race
condition to create setuid binaries in this directory tree, provided
that he already had write permissions in any subdirectory of that
tree.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-8.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.4-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
