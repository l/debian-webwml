<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Moritz Muehlenhoff discovered the handler code for backupninja creates
a temporary file with a predictable filename, leaving it vulnerable to
a symlink attack. </p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the backupninja package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your backupninja package.</p>
