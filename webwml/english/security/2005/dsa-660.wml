<p>Raphaël Enrici discovered that the KDE screensaver can crash under
certain local circumstances.  This can be exploited by an attacker
with physical access to the workstation to take over the desktop
session.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-14.9.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed upstream in KDE 3.0.5 and is therefore
fixed in the unstable (sid) and testing (sarge) distributions already.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kscreensaver package.</p>
