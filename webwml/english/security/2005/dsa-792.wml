<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered that pstotext, a utility to extract text from
PostScript and PDF files, did not execute ghostscript with the -dSAFER
argument, which prevents potential malicious operations to happen.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8g-5woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pstotext package.</p>
