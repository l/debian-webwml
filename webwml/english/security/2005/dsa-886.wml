<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in chmlib, a library for
dealing with CHM format files.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2659">CVE-2005-2659</a>

    <p>Palasik Sandor discoverd a buffer overflow in the LZX
    decompression method.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2930">CVE-2005-2930</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow has been discovered that could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3318">CVE-2005-3318</a>

    <p>Sven Tantau discoverd a buffer overflow that could lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain chmlib packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.35-6sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.37-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chmlib packages.</p>
