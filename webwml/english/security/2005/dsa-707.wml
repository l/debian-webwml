<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in MySQL, a popular
database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0957">CAN-2004-0957</a>

    <p>Sergei Golubchik discovered a problem in the access handling for
    similar named databases.  If a user is granted privileges to a
    database with a name containing an underscore ("_"), the user also
    gains privileges to other databases with similar names.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0709">CAN-2005-0709</a>

    <p>Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote
    authenticated users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to execute
    arbitrary code by using CREATE FUNCTION to access libc calls.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0710">CAN-2005-0710</a>

    <p>Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL allows remote authenticated
    users with INSERT and DELETE privileges to bypass library path
    restrictions and execute arbitrary libraries by using INSERT INTO
    to modify the mysql.func table.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0711">CAN-2005-0711</a>

   <p>Stefano Di Paola discovered that MySQL uses predictable file names
   when creating temporary tables, which allows local users with
   CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE privileges to overwrite arbitrary files via
   a symlink attack.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.24-5 of mysql-dfsg and in version 4.1.10a-6 of
mysql-dfsg-4.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.</p>
