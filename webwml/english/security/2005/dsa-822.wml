<define-tag description>insecure temporary file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered that gtkdiskfree, a GNOME program that shows
free and used space on filesystems, creates a temporary file in an
insecure fashion.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the gtkdiskfree
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gtkdiskfree package.</p>
