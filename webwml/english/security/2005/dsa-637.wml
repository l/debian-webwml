<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Philip Hazel announced a buffer overflow in the host_aton function in
exim-tls, the SSL-enabled version of the default mail-transport-agent
in Debian, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code via an
illegal IPv6 address.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.35-3woody3.</p>

<p>In the unstable distribution (sid) this package does not exist
anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim-tls package.</p>
