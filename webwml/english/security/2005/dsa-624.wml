<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in zip, the archiver for .zip
files.  When doing recursive folder compression the program did not
check the resulting path length, which would lead to memory being
overwritten.  A malicious person could convince a user to create an
archive containing a specially crafted path name, which could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30-5woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.30-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zip package.</p>
