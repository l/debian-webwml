<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in lynx, a text-mode
browser for the WWW that can be remotely exploited.  During the
handling of Asian characters when connecting to an NNTP server lynx
can be tricked to write past the boundary of a buffer which can lead
to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4.1b-3.3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lynx package.</p>
