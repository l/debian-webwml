<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several buffer overflows have been discovered in prozilla, a
multi-threaded download accelerator which could be exploited by a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.  An
exploit for prozilla is already in the wild.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.7.3-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your prozilla package.</p>
