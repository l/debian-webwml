<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ariel Berkman discovered several buffer overflows in xloadimage, a
graphics file viewer for X11, that can be exploited via large image
titles and cause the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1-10woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1-14.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xloadimage package.</p>
