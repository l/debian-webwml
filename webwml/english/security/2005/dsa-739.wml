<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered an input validation flaw within Trac, a wiki
and issue tracking system, that allows download/upload of files and
therefore can lead to remote code execution in some configurations.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the trac package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trac package.</p>
