<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap overflow has been discovered in the DVD subpicture decoder of
xine-lib.  An attacker could cause arbitrary code to be executed on
the victims host by supplying a malicious MPEG.  By tricking users to
view a malicious network stream, this is remotely exploitable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1-rc6a-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxine packages.</p>
