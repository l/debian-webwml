<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A format string vulnerability has been discovered in gedit, a
light-weight text editor for GNOME, that may allow attackers to cause
a denial of service (application crash) via a binary file with format
string specifiers in the filename.  Since gedit supports opening files
via "http://" URLs (through GNOME vfs) and other schemes, this might
be a remotely exploitable vulnerability.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.3-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gedit package.</p>
