<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>François-René Rideau discovered a bug in common-lisp-controller, a
Common Lisp source and compiler manager, that allows a local user to
compile malicious code into a cache directory which is executed by
another user if that user has not used Common Lisp before.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.15sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your common-lisp-controller package.</p>
