<define-tag description>frame injection spoofing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in Mozilla and Mozilla Firefox
that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary Javascript from one
page into the frameset of another site.  Thunderbird is not affected
by this and Galeon will be automatically fixed as it uses Mozilla
components.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain Mozilla Firefox
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla-firefox package.</p>
