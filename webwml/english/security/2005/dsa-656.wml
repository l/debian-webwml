<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit Team has
discovered that the vdr daemon which is used for video disk recorders
for DVB cards can overwrite arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.6-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vdr package.</p>
