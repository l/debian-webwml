<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the popular WWW
proxy cache.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2794">CAN-2005-2794</a>

    <p>Certain aborted requests that trigger an assert may allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2796">CAN-2005-2796</a>

    <p>Specially crafted requests can cause a denial of service.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.9-10sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.10-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
