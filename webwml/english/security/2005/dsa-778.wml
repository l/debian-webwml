<p>Two security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a
web-based bug tracking system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2556">CAN-2005-2556</a>

    <p>A remote attacker could insert arbitrary SQL code into SQL
    statements.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2557">CAN-2005-2557</a>

    <p>A remote attacker was able to insert arbitrary HTML code in bug
    reports, hence, cross site scripting.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2557">CAN-2005-3090</a>

    <p>A remote attacker was able to insert arbitrary HTML code in bug
    reports, hence, cross site scripting.</p>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.</p>
