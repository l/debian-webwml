<p>Christoph Martin noticed that upon configuration mason, which
interactively creates a Linux packet filtering firewall, does not
install the init script to actually load the firewall during system
boot.  This will leave the machine without a firewall after a reboot.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13.0.92-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0-2.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mason package.</p>
