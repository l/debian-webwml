<p>Albert Puigsech Galicia discovered a directory traversal vulnerability
in a proprietary FTP client (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1376">CAN-2004-1376</a>) which is also present in
gftp, a GTK+ FTP client.  A malicious server could provide a specially
crafted filename that could cause arbitrary files to be overwritten or
created by the client.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gftp package.</p>
