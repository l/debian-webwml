<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sj√∂lund discovered that playmidi, a MIDI player, contains a
setuid root program with a buffer overflow that can be exploited by a
local attacker.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4-4woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4debian-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your playmidi package.</p>
