<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sj√∂lund discovered that a support script of sympa, a mailing list
manager, is running setuid sympa and vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
This could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code under
the sympa user id.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sympa package.</p>
