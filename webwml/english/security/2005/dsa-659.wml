<define-tag description>information leak, integer underflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two problems have been discovered in the libpam-radius-auth package,
the PAM RADIUS authentication module.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1340">CAN-2004-1340</a>

    <p>The Debian package accidentally installed its configuration file
    /etc/pam_radius_auth.conf world-readable.  Since it may possibly
    contain secrets all local users are able to read them if the
    administrator hasn't adjusted file permissions.  This problem is
    Debian specific.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0108">CAN-2005-0108</a>

    <p>Leon Juranic discovered an integer underflow in the mod_auth_radius
    module for Apache which is also present in libpam-radius-auth.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.14-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.16-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-radius-auth package.</p>
