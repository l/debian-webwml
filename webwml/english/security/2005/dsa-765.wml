<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  Heimdal, a free implementation
of Kerberos 5, also contains such a client.  This can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4e-7.woody.11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-10.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal package.</p>
