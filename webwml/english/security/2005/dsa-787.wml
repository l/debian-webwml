<p>Two bugs have been found in backup-manager, a command-line driven
backup utility.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1855">CAN-2005-1855</a>

    <p>Jeroen Vermeulen discovered that backup files are created with
    default permissions making them world readable, even though they
    may contain sensitive information.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1856">CAN-2005-1856</a>

    <p>Sven Joachim discovered that the optional CD-burning feature of
    backup-manager uses a hardcoded filename in a world-writable
    directory for logging.  This can be subject to a symlink attack.</p>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not provide the
backup-manager package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.7-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your backup-manager package.</p>
