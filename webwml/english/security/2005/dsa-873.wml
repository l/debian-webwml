<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A security vulnerability has been found in Net-SNMP releases that
could allow a denial of service attack against Net-SNMP agent's that
have opened a stream based protocol (eg TCP but not UDP).  By default,
Net-SNMP does not open a TCP port.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a net-snmp package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-6.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp package.</p>
