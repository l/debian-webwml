<p>This advisory does only cover updated packages for Debian 3.0
alias woody. For reference below is the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two bugs have been discovered in qpopper, an enhanced Post Office
Protocol (POP3) server.  The Common Vulnerability and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1151">CAN-2005-1151</a>

    <p>Jens Steube discovered that while processing local files owned or
    provided by a normal user privileges weren't dropped, which could
    lead to the overwriting or creation of arbitrary files as root.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1152">CAN-2005-1152</a>

    <p>The upstream developers noticed that qpopper could be tricked to
    creating group- or world-writable files.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.4-2.woody.5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in
version 4.0.5-4sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qpopper package.</p>
