<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow with subsequent buffer overflow has been detected
in PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows
an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Since several packages link dynamically to this library you are
advised to restart the corresponding services or programs
respectively.  The command ``apt-cache showpkg libpcre3'' will list
the corresponding packages in the "Reverse Depends:" section.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4-1.1woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5-1.2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpcre3 package.</p>
