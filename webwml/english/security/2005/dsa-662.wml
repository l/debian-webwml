<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrew Archibald discovered that the last update to squirrelmail which
was intended to fix several problems caused a regression which got
exposed when the user hits a session timeout.  For completeness below
is the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0104">CAN-2005-0104</a>

    <p>Upstream developers noticed that an unsanitised variable could
    lead to cross site scripting.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0152">CAN-2005-0152</a>

    <p>Grant Hollingworth discovered that under certain circumstances URL
    manipulation could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
    the privileges of www-data.  This problem only exists in version
    1.2.6 of Squirrelmail.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) the problem that affects unstable
has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
