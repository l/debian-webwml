<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was recently found in the way that SpamAssassin parses
certain email headers. This vulnerability could cause SpamAssassin to
consume a large number of CPU cycles when processing messages containing
these headers, leading to a potential denial of service (DOS) attack. </p>

<p>The version of SpamAssassin in the old stable distribution (woody) is
not vulnerable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3-2. Note that packages are not yet ready for certain
architectures; these will be released as they become available.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sarge or sid spamassassin package.</p>
