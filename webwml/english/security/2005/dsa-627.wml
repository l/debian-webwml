<define-tag description>unsanitised input</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in namazu2, a
full text search engine.  An attacker could prepare specially crafted
input that would not be sanitised by namazu2 and hence displayed
verbatim for the victim.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.10-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your namazu2 package.</p>
