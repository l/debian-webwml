<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered that the DBI library, the Perl5 database interface, creates
a temporary PID file in an insecure manner.  This can be exploited by a
malicious user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the person
executing the parts of the library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.46-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdbi-perl package.</p>
