<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña discovered that several scripts of the
hylafax suite, a flexible client/server fax software, create temporary
files and directories in an insecure fashion, leaving them vulnerable
to symlink exploits.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-3.2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.1-5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.</p>
