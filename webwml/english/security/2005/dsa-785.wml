<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that libpam-ldap, the Pluggable Authentication
Module allowing LDAP interfaces, ignores the result of an attempt to
authenticate against an LDAP server that does not set an optional data
field.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 178-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 178-1sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-ldap package.</p>
