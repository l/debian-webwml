<define-tag description>weak hostname and username validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Patrice Fournier discovered a vulnerability in the authorisation
subsystem of hylafax, a flexible client/server fax system.  A local or
remote user guessing the contents of the hosts.hfaxd database could
gain unauthorised access to the fax system.</p>

<p>Some installations of hylafax may actually utilise the weak hostname
and username validation for authorized uses.  For example, hosts.hfaxd
entries that may be common are</p>

<pre>
  192.168.0
  username:uid:pass:adminpass
  user@host
</pre>

<p>After updating, these entries will need to be modified in order to
continue to function.  Respectively, the correct entries should be</p>

<pre>
  192.168.0.[0-9]+
  username@:uid:pass:adminpass
  user@host
</pre>

<p>Unless such matching of "username" with "otherusername" and "host" with
"hostname" is desired, the proper form of these entries should include
the delimiter and markers like this</p>

<pre>
  @192.168.0.[0-9]+$
  ^username@:uid:pass:adminpass
  ^user@host$
</pre>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-3.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.</p>
