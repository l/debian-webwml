<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kevin Finisterre reports that affix, a package used to manage
bluetooth sessions under Linux, uses the popen call in an unsafe
fashion. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute
arbitrary commands on a vulnerable system.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the affix
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your affix package.</p>
