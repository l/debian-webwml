<p>Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
phpmyadmin, a set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the WWW.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2869">CAN-2005-2869</a>

    <p>Andreas Kerber and Michal Cihar discovered several cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities in the error page and in the cookie
    login.</p>

<p>CVE-2005-3300</p>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered missing safety checks in grab_globals.php
    that could allow an attacker to induce phpmyadmin to include an
    arbitrary local file.</p>

<p>CVE-2005-3301</p>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to inject arbitrary
    HTML or client-side scripting.</p>

<p>The version in the old stable distribution (woody) has probably its
own flaws and is not easily fixable without a full audit and patch
session.  The easier way is to upgrade it from woody to sarge.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.4-pl1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
