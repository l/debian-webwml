<define-tag description>memory alignment bug</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Szymon Zygmunt and Michal Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment
error in libgadu (from ekg, console Gadu Gadu client, an instant
messaging program) which is included in gaim, a multi-protocol instant
messaging client, as well.  This can not be exploited on the x86
architecture but on others, e.g. on Sparc and lead to a bus error,
in other words a denial of service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-1.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gaim package.</p>
