<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a buffer
overflow in ketm, an old school 2D-scrolling shooter game, that can be
exploited to execute arbitrary code with group games privileges.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.6-7woody0.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.6-17sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.6-17sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ketm package.</p>
