<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A bug has been discovered in enigmail, GPG support for Mozilla
MailNews and Mozilla Thunderbird, that can lead to the encryption of
mail with the wrong public key, hence, potential disclosure of
confidential data to others.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain enigmail packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91-4sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.93-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your enigmail packages.</p>
