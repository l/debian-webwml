<p>Several bugs have been found in junkbuster, a HTTP proxy and filter.
The Common Vulnerability and Exposures project identifies the
following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1108">CAN-2005-1108</a>

    <p>James Ranson discovered that an attacker can modify the referrer
    setting with a carefully crafted URL by accidentally overwriting a
    global variable.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1109">CAN-2005-1109</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy from the Gentoo Security Team discovered several
    heap corruptions due to inconsistent use of an internal function
    that can crash the daemon or possibly lead to the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-0.2woody1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) doesn't contain the junkbuster package
anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your junkbuster package.</p>
