<define-tag description>infinite loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered that a specially crafted archive can trigger an
infinete loop in bzip2, a high-quality block-sorting file compressor.
During uncompression this results in an indefinitively growing output
file which will finally fill up the disk.  On systems that
automatically decompress bzip2 archives this can cause a denial of
service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1.woody5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bzip2 package.</p>
