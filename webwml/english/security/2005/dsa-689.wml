<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Graham Dumpleton discovered a flaw which can affect anyone using the
publisher handle of the Apache Software Foundation's mod_python.  The
publisher handle lets you publish objects inside modules to make them
callable via URL.  The flaw allows a carefully crafted URL to obtain
extra information that should not be visible (information leak).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8-0.0woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.10-4 of libapache-mod-python and in version 3.1.3-3 of
libapache2-mod-python.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-python package.</p>
