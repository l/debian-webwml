<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>[&nbsp;This version lists the correct packages in the packages
section.&nbsp;]</p>

<p>A buffer overflow has been detected in the IAPP dissector of Ethereal,
a commonly used network traffic analyser.  A remote attacker may be
able to overflow a buffer using a specially crafted packet.  More
problems have been discovered which don't apply to the version in
woody but are fixed in sid as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody12.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
