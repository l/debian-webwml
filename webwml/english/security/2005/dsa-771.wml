<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several problems have been discovered in pdns, a versatile nameserver
that can lead to a denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2301">CAN-2005-2301</a>

    <p>Norbert Sendetzky and Jan de Groot discovered that the LDAP backend
    did not properly escape all queries, allowing it to fail and not
    answer queries anymore.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2302">CAN-2005-2302</a>

    <p>Wilco Baan discovered that queries from clients without recursion
    permission can temporarily blank out domains to clients with
    recursion permitted.  This enables outside users to blank out a
    domain temporarily to normal users.</p>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdns packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.17-13sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns package.</p>
