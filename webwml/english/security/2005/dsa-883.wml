<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit team
discovered that the syslogtocern script from thttpd, a tiny webserver,
uses a temporary file insecurely, allowing a local attacker to craft a
symlink attack to overwrite arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.21b-11.3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.23beta1-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.23beta1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your thttpd package.</p>
