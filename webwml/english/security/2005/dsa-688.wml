<p>Upstream developers have discovered several problems in squid, the
Internet object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  A remote attacker
can cause squid to crash via certain DNS responses.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.8-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
