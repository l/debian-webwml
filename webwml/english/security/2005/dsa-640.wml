<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjölund discovered a buffer overflow in xatitv, one of the
programs in the gatos package, that is used to display video with
certain ATI video cards.  xatitv is installed setuid root in order to
gain direct access to the video hardware.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.5-6woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.5-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gatos package.</p>
