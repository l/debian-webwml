<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
format string vulnerability in bidwatcher, a tool for watching and
bidding on eBay auctions.  This problem can be triggered remotely by a
web server of eBay, or someone pretending to be eBay, sending certain
data back.  As of version 1.3.17 the program uses cURL and is not
vulnerable anymore.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bidwatcher package.</p>
