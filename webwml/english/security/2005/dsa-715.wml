<p>Several problems have been discovered in the CVS server, which serves
the popular Concurrent Versions System.  The Common Vulnerability and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1342">CAN-2004-1342</a>

    <p>Maks Polunin and Alberto Garcia discovered independently that
    using the pserver access method in connection with the repouid
    patch that Debian uses it is possible to bypass the password and
    gain access to the repository in question.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1343">CAN-2004-1343</a>

    <p>Alberto Garcia discovered that a remote user can cause the cvs
    server to crash when the cvs-repouids file exists but does not
    contain a mapping for the current repository, which can be used as
    a denial of service attack.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.11.1p1debian-10.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.9-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvs package.</p>
