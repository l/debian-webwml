<p>The last update of tkdiff contained a programming error which is
fixed by this version.  For completeness we're adding the original
advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that tkdiff, a graphical side by side "diff" utility,
creates temporary files in an insecure fashion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.08-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-4.</p>
