<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that tkdiff, a graphical side by side "diff" utility,
creates temporary files in an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.08-3woody0.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-1sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tkdiff package.</p>
