<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>John Goerzen discovered that gopher, a client for the Gopher
Distributed Hypertext protocol, creates temporary files in an insecure
fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.7sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gopher package.</p>
