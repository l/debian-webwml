<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in kismet, a
wireless 802.11b monitoring tool.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2626">CAN-2005-2626</a>

    <p>Insecure handling of unprintable characters in the SSID.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2627">CAN-2005-2627</a>

    <p>Multiple integer underflows could allow remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code.</p>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2005.04.R1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2005.08.R1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kismet package.</p>
