<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several problems have been discovered in telnet clients that could be
exploited by malicious daemons the client connects to.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0468">CAN-2005-0468</a>

    <p>Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env_opt_add()
    function that allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0469">CAN-2005-0469</a>

    <p>Gaël Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
    LINEMODE suboptions in telnet clients.  This can lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code when connected to a malicious server.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1-8-2.4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.2-11.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.2-11.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb4 packages.</p>
