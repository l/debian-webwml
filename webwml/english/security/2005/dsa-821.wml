<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow with a subsequent buffer overflow has been detected
in PCRE, the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions library, which allows
an attacker to execute arbitrary code, and is also present in Python.
Exploiting this vulnerability requires an attacker to specify the used
regular expression.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain python2.3 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python2.3 packages.</p>
