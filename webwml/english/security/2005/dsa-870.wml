<p>Tavis Ormandy noticed that sudo, a program that provides limited super
user privileges to specific users, does not clean the environment
sufficiently.  The SHELLOPTS and PS4 variables are dangerous and are
still passed through to the program running as privileged user.  This
can result in the execution of arbitrary commands as privileged user
when a bash script is executed.  These vulnerabilities can only be
exploited by users who have been granted limited super user
privileges.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8p7-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8p9-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.</p>
