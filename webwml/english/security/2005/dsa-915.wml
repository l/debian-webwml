<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow has been discovered in helix-player, the helix
audio and video player.  This flaw could allow a remote attacker to
run arbitrary code on a victims computer by supplying a specially
crafted network resource.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is fixed by version 1.0.6-1 in unstable.
Helix-player is not currently in the testing distribution.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a helix-player
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your helix-player package.</p>
