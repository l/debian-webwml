<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been detected in the X11 dissector of ethereal,
a commonly used network traffic analyser.  A remote attacker may be
able to overflow a buffer using a specially crafted IP packet.  More
problems have been discovered which don't apply to the version in
woody but are fixed in sid as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal package.</p>
