<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sj√∂lund has discovered several security relevant problems in
enscript, a program to convert ASCII text into Postscript and other
formats.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1184">CAN-2004-1184</a>

    <p>Unsanitised input can cause the execution of arbitrary commands
    via EPSF pipe support.  This has been disabled, also upstream.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1185">CAN-2004-1185</a>

    <p>Due to missing sanitising of filenames it is possible that a
    specially crafted filename can cause arbitrary commands to be
    executed.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1186">CAN-2004-1186</a>

    <p>Multiple buffer overflows can cause the program to crash.</p>

</ul>

<p>Usually, enscript is only run locally, but since it is executed inside
of viewcvs some of the problems mentioned above can easily be turned
into a remote vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.3-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.4-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your enscript package.</p>
