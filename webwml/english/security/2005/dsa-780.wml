<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A bug has been discovered in the font handling code in xpdf, which is
also present in kpdf, the PDF viewer for KDE.  A specially crafted PDF
file could cause infinite resource consumption, in terms of both CPU
and disk space.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed as soon
as the necessary libraries have made their C++ ABI transition.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf package.</p>
