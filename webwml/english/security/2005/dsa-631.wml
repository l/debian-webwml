<p>Thiago Macieira discovered a vulnerability in the kioslave library,
which is part of kdelibs, which allows a remote attacker to execute
arbitrary FTP commands via an ftp:// URL that contains a URL-encoded
newline before the FTP command.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-13.woody.13.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs3 package.</p>
