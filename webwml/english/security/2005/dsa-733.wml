Debian Bug     : </p>

<p>Justin Rye discovered that crip, a terminal-based ripper, encoder and
tagger tool, utilises temporary files in an insecure fashion in its
helper scripts.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not provide the crip package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5-1sarge2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your crip package.</p>
