<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in dropbear, a lightweight SSH2
server and client, that may allow authenticated users to execute
arbitrary code as the server user (usually root).</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain dropbear packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.45-2sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.47-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dropbear package.</p>
