<define-tag description>missing privilege release</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered that the lockmail program from maildrop, a
simple mail delivery agent with filtering abilities, does not drop
group privileges before executing commands given on the commandline,
allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands under with group
mail privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-1.1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your maildrop package.</p>
