<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in ethereal, a commonly used
network traffic analyser that causes a denial of service and may
potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody14.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
