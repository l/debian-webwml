<p>Javier Fernandez-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered a temporary file vulnerability in the mysqlaccess script of
MySQL that could allow an unprivileged user to let root overwrite
arbitrary files via a symlink attack and could also could unveil the
contents of a temporary file which might contain sensitive
information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.23-3 of mysql-dfsg and in version 4.1.8a-6 of
mysql-dfsg-4.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.</p>
