<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Clam AntiVirus, the
antivirus scanner for Unix, designed for integration with mail servers
to perform attachment scanning.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3239">CVE-2005-3239</a>

    <p>The OLE2 unpacker allows remote attackers to cause a segmentation
    fault via a DOC file with an invalid property tree, which triggers
    an infinite recursion.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3303">CVE-2005-3303</a>

    <p>A specially crafted executable compressed with FSG 1.33 could
    cause the extractor to write beyond buffer boundaries, allowing an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3500">CVE-2005-3500</a>

    <p>A specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an
    infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting
    in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3501">CVE-2005-3501</a>

    <p>A specially crafted CAB file could cause ClamAV to be locked in an
    infinite loop and use all available processor resources, resulting
    in a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.87.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
