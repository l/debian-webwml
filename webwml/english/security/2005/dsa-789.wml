<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security related problems have been found in PHP4, the
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1751">CAN-2005-1751</a>

    <p>Eric Romang discovered insecure temporary files in the shtool
    utility shipped with PHP that can exploited by a local attacker to
    overwrite arbitrary files.  Only this vulnerability affects
    packages in oldstable.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-1921">CAN-2005-1921</a>

    <p>GulfTech has discovered that PEAR XML_RPC is vulnerable to a
    remote PHP code execution vulnerability that may allow an attacker
    to compromise a vulnerable server.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2498">CAN-2005-2498</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered another vulnerability in the XML-RPC
    libraries that allows injection of arbitrary PHP code into eval()
    statements.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.2-7.woody5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.10-16.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.0-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages.</p>
