<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered a buffer overflow in the RTF importer of kword,
a word processor for the KDE Office Suite that can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a kword package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4.sarge.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.5-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kword package.</p>
