<p>David Watson discoverd a bug in mount as provided by util-linux and
other packages such as loop-aes-utils that allows local users to
bypass filesystem access restrictions by re-mounting it read-only.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11n-7woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12p-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux package.</p>
