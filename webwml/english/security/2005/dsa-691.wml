<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in abuse, the SDL port of
the Abuse action game.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0098">CAN-2005-0098</a>

    <p>Erik Sjölund discovered several buffer overflows in the command line
    handling, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code with
    elevated privileges since it is installed setuid root.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-0099">CAN-2005-0099</a>

    <p>Steve Kemp discoverd that that abuse creates some files without
    dropping privileges first, which may lead to the creation and
    overwriting of arbitrary files.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.00+-3woody4.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain an abuse package anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your abuse package.</p>
