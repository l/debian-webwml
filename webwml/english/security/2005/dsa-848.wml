<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jens Steube discovered two vulnerabilities in masqmail, a mailer for
hosts without permanent internet connection.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2662">CAN-2005-2662</a>

    <p>When sending failed mail messages, the address is not sanitised,
    which allows a local attacker to execute arbitrary commands as the
    mail user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2005-2663">CAN-2005-2663</a>

    <p>When opening the log file, masqmail does not relinquish
    privileges, which allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary
    files via a symlink attack.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.1.16-2.2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.20-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.20-1sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your masqmail package.</p>
