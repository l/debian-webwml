<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer overflows and other
implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or
bypass of the same-origin policy. Also, a man-in-the-middle attack in
the addon update mechanism has been fixed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.5.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 45.5.0esr-1 and version 50.0-1 of the firefox source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.</p>
