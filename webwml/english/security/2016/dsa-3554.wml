<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3158">CVE-2016-3158</a>,
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3159">CVE-2016-3159</a> (XSA-172)

    <p>Jan Beulich from SUSE discovered that Xen does not properly handle
    writes to the hardware FSW.ES bit when running on AMD64 processors.
    A malicious domain can take advantage of this flaw to obtain address
    space usage and timing information, about another domain, at a
    fairly low rate.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3960">CVE-2016-3960</a> (XSA-173)

    <p>Ling Liu and Yihan Lian of the Cloud Security Team, Qihoo 360
    discovered an integer overflow in the x86 shadow pagetable code. A
    HVM guest using shadow pagetables can cause the host to crash. A PV
    guest using shadow pagetables (i.e. being migrated) with PV
    superpages enabled (which is not the default) can crash the host, or
    corrupt hypervisor memory, potentially leading to privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
