<p>It was discovered that libpam-sshauth, a PAM module to authenticate
using an SSH server, does not correctly handle system users. In certain
configurations an attacker can take advantage of this flaw to gain root
privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.4.1-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-sshauth packages.</p>
