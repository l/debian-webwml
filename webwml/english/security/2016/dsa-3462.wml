<p>Two vulnerabilities were fixed in radicale, a CardDAV/CalDAV server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8747">CVE-2015-8747</a>

    <p>The (not configured by default and not available on Wheezy)
    multifilesystem storage backend allows read and write access to
    arbitrary files (still subject to the DAC permissions of the user
    the radicale server is running as).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8748">CVE-2015-8748</a>

    <p>If an attacker is able to authenticate with a user name like `.*',
    he can bypass read/write limitations imposed by regex-based rules,
    including the built-in rules `owner_write' (read for everybody,
    write for the calendar owner) and `owner_only' (read and write for
    the the calendar owner).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.7-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your radicale packages.</p>
