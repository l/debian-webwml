<p>Several issues have been discovered by Unrud in Radicale, a calendar
and addressbook server. A remote attacker could exploit these
vulnerabilities and call arbitrary functions by sending crafted HTTP
requests.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8748">CVE-2015-8748</a>

        <p>Prevent regex injection in rights management.
        Prevent crafted HTTP request from calling arbitrary functions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8747">CVE-2015-8747</a>

        <p>The multifilesystem backend allows access to arbitrary files
        on all platforms. (Squeeze is not affected because the
        multifilesystem backend does not exist in this version.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in version
0.3-2+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your radicale packages.</p>
