<p>High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered that Roundcube, a
webmail client, contained a path traversal vulnerability. This flaw
could be exploited by an attacker to access sensitive files on the
server, or even execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.7.2-9+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1.1.4+dfsg.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.</p>
