<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol
client and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0749">CVE-2016-0749</a>

    <p>Jing Zhao of Red Hat discovered a memory allocation flaw, leading to
    a heap-based buffer overflow in spice's smartcard interaction. A
    user connecting to a guest VM via spice can take advantage of this
    flaw to cause a denial-of-service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2150">CVE-2016-2150</a>

    <p>Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that a malicious guest inside
    a virtual machine can take control of the corresponding QEMU process
    in the host using crafted primary surface parameters.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.</p>
