    <p>It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string
    without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible
    for an attacker with permission to modify the database.</p></li>

    <p>It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which
    uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to
    exhaust all available memory.</p></li>
