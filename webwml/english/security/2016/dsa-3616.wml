<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9904">CVE-2014-9904</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the snd_compress_check_input function used in
    the ALSA subsystem does not properly check for an integer overflow,
    allowing a local user to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5728">CVE-2016-5728</a>

    <p>Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver that
    could allow a local user to obtain sensitive information from kernel
    memory or cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5828">CVE-2016-5828</a>

    <p>Cyril Bur and Michael Ellerman discovered a flaw in the handling of
    Transactional Memory on powerpc systems allowing a local user to
    cause a denial of service (kernel crash) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact, by starting a transaction, suspending it,
    and then calling any of the exec() class system calls.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5829">CVE-2016-5829</a>

    <p>A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in the hiddev
    driver, allowing a local user to cause a denial of service or,
    potentially escalate their privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6130">CVE-2016-6130</a>

    <p>Pengfei Wang discovered a flaw in the S/390 character device drivers
    potentially leading to information leak with /dev/sclp.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally this update fixes a regression in the ebtables facility
(#828914) that was introduced in DSA-3607-1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt25-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
