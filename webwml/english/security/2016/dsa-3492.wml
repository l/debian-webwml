<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The wheezy part of the previous gajim update, DSA-3492-1, was
incorrectly built resulting in an unsatisfiable dependency. This update
corrects that problem. For reference, the original advisory text
follows.</p>

<p>Daniel Gultsch discovered a vulnerability in Gajim, an XMPP/jabber
client. Gajim didn't verify the origin of roster update, allowing an
attacker to spoof them and potentially allowing her to intercept
messages.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.15.1-4.1+deb7u2.</p>

p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16.5-0.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.</p>
