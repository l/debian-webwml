<p>Daniel Gultsch discovered a vulnerability in Gajim, an XMPP/jabber
client. Gajim didn't verify the origin of roster update, allowing an
attacker to spoof them and potentially allowing her to intercept messages.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.15.1-4.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16.5-0.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.</p>
