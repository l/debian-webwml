<p>Gustavo Grieco discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library
for C++, mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents,
resulting in buffer overflows during processing and error reporting.
These flaws could lead to a denial of service in applications using the
xerces-c library, or potentially, to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.1-3+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-5.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.</p>
