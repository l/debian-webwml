<p>Javantea discovered that pygments, a generic syntax highlighter, is
prone to a shell injection vulnerability allowing a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in a font name.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.5+dfsg-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1+dfsg-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.1+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pygments packages.</p>
