<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that InspIRCd did not validate the names in DNS
responses before using them in inter-server communication.  A remote
attacker controlling the reverse DNS server for an IRC client could
use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation on
the IRC network.</p>

<p>InspIRCd appears to have been completely unusable since version
1.1.22+dfsg-4+squeeze1 due to a bug in its build system triggered by
(e)glibc versions newer than 2.9.  This has also been fixed.</p>
