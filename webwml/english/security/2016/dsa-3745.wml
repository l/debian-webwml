<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Saulius Lapinskas from Lithuanian State Social Insurance Fund Board
discovered that Squid3, a fully featured web proxy cache, does not
properly process responses to If-None-Modified HTTP conditional
requests, leading to client-specific Cookie data being leaked to other
clients. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to discover
private and sensitive information about another clients browsing
session.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u4. In addition, this update includes a fix for
\#819563.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.23-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
