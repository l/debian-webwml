<p>As described in <a href="./dla-437">DLA-437-1</a>, clamav has been updated to the most recent upstream
version, 0.99.  Due to a soname change in libclamav, packages depending on
libclamav needed to be recompiled to work with the new libclamav7.  At the
time DLA-437-1 was sent, updated dansguardian packages were not available.</p>

<p>An update to dansguardian has now been uploaded and packages should be
available shortly.  The recommendation in DLA-437-1 not to upgrade clamav if
using it with dansguardian in no longer applicable.</p>

<p>Upgrading clamav and dansguardian is recommended for the reasons described in
DLA-437-1.</p>
