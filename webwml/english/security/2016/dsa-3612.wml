<p>Shmuel H discovered that GIMP, the GNU Image Manipulation Program, is
prone to a use-after-free vulnerability in the channel and layer
properties parsing process when loading a XCF file. An attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running GIMP if a specially crafted XCF file is
processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.14-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.</p>
