<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>WordPress versions 4.4.1 and earlier are affected by two security
issues: a possible Side Request Forgery Vulnerability for certain
local URIs, reported by Ronni Skansing; and an open redirection
attack, reported by Shailesh Suthar.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2221">CVE-2016-2221</a>

   <p>Wordpress could be vulnerable for an open redirection attack
   which was fixed by better validation of the URL used in HTTP
   redirects.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2222">CVE-2016-2222</a>

   <p>It was discovered that Wordpress was susceptible for a possible Side
   Request Forgery Vulnerability because it considered for instance
   0.1.2.3 as a valid IP.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb6u9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
