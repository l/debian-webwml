<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a maliciously crafted packet can crash any of the
isc-dhcp applications. This includes the DHCP client, relay, and server
application. Only IPv4 setups are affected.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages to version
4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze9 (Debian squeeze LTS).</p>
