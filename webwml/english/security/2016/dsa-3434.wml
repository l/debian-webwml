<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leak.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7513">CVE-2015-7513</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a local user permitted to use the x86 KVM
    subsystem could configure the PIT emulation to cause a denial of
    service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7550">CVE-2015-7550</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the keyring subsystem
    that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543">CVE-2015-8543</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets
    could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol
    number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP_NET_RAW
    capability.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8550">CVE-2015-8550</a>

    <p>Felix Wilhelm of ERNW discovered that the Xen PV backend drivers
    may read critical data from shared memory multiple times. This
    flaw can be used by a guest kernel to cause a denial of service
    (crash) on the host, or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8551">CVE-2015-8551</a> /
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8552">CVE-2015-8552</a>

    <p>Konrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle discovered that the Xen PCI
    backend driver does not adequately validate the device state when
    a guest configures MSIs. This flaw can be used by a guest kernel
    to cause a denial of service (crash or disk space exhaustion) on
    the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8569">CVE-2015-8569</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov discovered a flaw in the PPTP sockets implementation
    that leads to an information leak to local users.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8575">CVE-2015-8575</a>

    <p>David Miller discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth SCO sockets
    implementation that leads to an information leak to local users.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8709">CVE-2015-8709</a>

    <p>Jann Horn discovered a flaw in the permission checks for use of
    the ptrace feature. A local user who has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE
    capability within their own user namespace could use this flaw for
    privilege escalation if a more privileged process ever enters that
    user namespace. This affects at least the LXC system.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, this update fixes some regressions in the previous update:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/808293">#808293</a>

    <p>A regression in the UDP implementation prevented freeradius and
    some other applications from receiving data.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/808602">#808602</a> / 
    <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/808953">#808953</a>

    <p>A regression in the USB XHCI driver prevented use of some devices
    in USB 3 SuperSpeed ports.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/808973">#808973</a>

    <p>A fix to the radeon driver interacted with an existing bug to
    cause a crash at boot when using some AMD/ATI graphics cards.
    This issue only affects wheezy.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u2. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8709">CVE-2015-8709</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u2. 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8543">CVE-2015-8543</a> 
was already fixed in version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.3-3 or earlier.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
