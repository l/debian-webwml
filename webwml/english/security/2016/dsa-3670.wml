<p>Dawid Golunski of LegalHackers discovered that the Tomcat init script
performed unsafe file handling, which could result in local privilege
escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.0.14-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.</p>
