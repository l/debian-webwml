<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities have been fixed in the Tomcat servlet
and JSP engine, which may result on bypass of security manager
restrictions, information disclosure, denial of service or session
fixation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0.45+dfsg-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat6 packages.</p>
