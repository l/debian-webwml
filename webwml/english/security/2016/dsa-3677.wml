<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libarchive, a multi-format
archive and compression library, which may lead to denial of service
(memory consumption and application crash), bypass of sandboxing
restrictions and overwrite arbitrary files with arbitrary data from an
archive, or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-11+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.</p>
