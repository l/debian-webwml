<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that dbconfig-common could, depending on the local
umask, make PostgreSQL database backups that were readable by other
users than the database owner. The issue is fixed in version
1.8.46+squeeze.1. Access rights to existing database backups (not only
for PostgreSQL) will be limited to the owner of the backup during the
upgrade of dbconfig-common to this version. Future upgrades will not
change access rights in case the local administrator has specific
requirements.</p>

<p>dbconfig-common is a Debian helper package that is used by a number of
packages to manage the corresponding database.</p>
