<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors and a
buffer overflow may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. In addition
the bundled NSS crypto library addresses the SLOTH attack on TLS 1.2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.6.0esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.6.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 44.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
