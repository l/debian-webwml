<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat
servlet and JSP engine, as well as in its Debian-specific maintainer
scripts. Those flaws allowed for privilege escalation, information
disclosure, and remote code execution.</p>

<p>As part of this update, several regressions stemming from incomplete
fixes for previous vulnerabilities were also fixed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.56-3+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 7.0.72-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.</p>
