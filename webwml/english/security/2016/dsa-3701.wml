<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dawid Golunski reported the nginx web server packages in Debian
suffered from a privilege escalation vulnerability (www-data to root)
due to the way log files are handled.  This security update changes
ownership of the /var/log/nginx directory root.  In addition,
/var/log/nginx has to be made accessible to local users, and local
users may be able to read the log files themselves local until the
next logrotate invocation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-5+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
