<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
toolkit.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0702">CVE-2016-0702</a>

    <p>Yuval Yarom from the University of Adelaide and NICTA, Daniel Genkin
    from Technion and Tel Aviv University, and Nadia Heninger from the
    University of Pennsylvania discovered a side-channel attack which
    makes use of cache-bank conflicts on the Intel Sandy-Bridge
    microarchitecture. This could allow local attackers to recover RSA
    private keys.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0705">CVE-2016-0705</a>

    <p>Adam Langley from Google discovered a double free bug when parsing
    malformed DSA private keys. This could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service or memory corruption in applications
    parsing DSA private keys received from untrusted sources.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0797">CVE-2016-0797</a>

    <p>Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BN_hex2bn and
    BN_dec2bn functions that can lead to a NULL pointer dereference and
    heap corruption. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service or memory corruption in applications processing hex or
    dec data received from untrusted sources.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0798">CVE-2016-0798</a>

    <p>Emilia Käsper of the OpenSSL development team discovered a memory
    leak in the SRP database lookup code. To mitigate the memory leak,
    the seed handling in SRP_VBASE_get_by_user is now disabled even if
    the user has configured a seed. Applications are advised to migrate
    to the SRP_VBASE_get1_by_user function.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0799">CVE-2016-0799</a>

    <p>Guido Vranken discovered an integer overflow in the BIO_*printf
    functions that could lead to an OOB read when printing very long
    strings. Additionally the internal doapr_outch function can attempt
    to write to an arbitrary memory location in the event of a memory
    allocation failure. These issues will only occur on platforms where
    sizeof(size_t) > sizeof(int) like many 64 bit systems. This could
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or memory
    corruption in applications that pass large amounts of untrusted data
    to the BIO_*printf functions.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally the EXPORT and LOW ciphers were disabled since thay could
be used as part of the DROWN
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0800">CVE-2016-0800</a>)
and SLOTH
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575">CVE-2015-7575</a>)
attacks, but note that the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie)
distributions are not affected by those attacks since the SSLv2 protocol
has already been dropped in the openssl package version 1.0.0c-2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u20.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
