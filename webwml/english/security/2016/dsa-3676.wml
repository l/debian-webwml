<p>Tuomas Räsänen discovered two vulnerabilities in unADF, a tool to extract
files from an Amiga Disk File dump (.adf):</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1243">CVE-2016-1243</a>

    <p>A stack buffer overflow in the function extractTree() might allow an
    attacker, with control on the content of a ADF file, to execute
    arbitrary code with the privileges of the program execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1244">CVE-2016-1244</a>

    <p>The unADF extractor creates the path in the destination via a mkdir
    in a system() call. Since there was no sanitization on the input of
    the filenames, an attacker can directly inject code in the pathnames
    of archived directories in an ADF file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.7.11a-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.11a-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.11a-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unadf packages.</p>
