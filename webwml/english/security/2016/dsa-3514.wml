<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7560">CVE-2015-7560</a>

    <p>Jeremy Allison of Google, Inc. and the Samba Team discovered that
    Samba incorrectly handles getting and setting ACLs on a symlink
    path. An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions
    to create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX
    SMB1 calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or
    directory linked to.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771">CVE-2016-0771</a>

    <p>Garming Sam and Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst IT discovered that Samba
    is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record
    handling, if Samba is deployed as an AD DC and chosen to run the
    internal DNS server. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service (Samba crash), or potentially, to allow
    leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally this update includes a fix for a regression introduced due
to the upstream fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252">CVE-2015-5252</a> in DSA-3433-1 in setups where the
share path is '/'.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not
affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0771">CVE-2016-0771</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.3.6+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
