<p>lighttpd, a small webserver, is vulnerable to the POODLE attack via
the use of SSLv3. This protocol is now disabled by default.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.31-4+deb7u4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.</p>
