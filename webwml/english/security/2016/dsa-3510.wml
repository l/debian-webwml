<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, address bar
spoofing and overwriting local files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.7.0esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.7.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), Debian is in the process of moving
back towards using the Firefox name. These problems will soon be fixed
in the firefox-esr source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
