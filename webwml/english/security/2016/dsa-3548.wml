<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5370">CVE-2015-5370</a>

    <p>Jouni Knuutinen from Synopsys discovered flaws in the Samba DCE-RPC
    code which can lead to denial of service (crashes and high cpu
    consumption) and man-in-the-middle attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2110">CVE-2016-2110</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that the
    feature negotiation of NTLMSSP does not protect against downgrade
    attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2111">CVE-2016-2111</a>

    <p>When Samba is configured as domain controller, it allows remote
    attackers to spoof the computer name of a secure channel's endpoint,
    and obtain sensitive session information. This flaw corresponds to
    the same vulnerability as <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0005">CVE-2015-0005</a> for Windows, discovered by
    Alberto Solino from Core Security.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2112">CVE-2016-2112</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can downgrade LDAP connections to avoid
    integrity protection.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2113">CVE-2016-2113</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that
    man-in-the-middle attacks are possible for client triggered LDAP
    connections and ncacn_http connections.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2114">CVE-2016-2114</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that Samba
    does not enforce required smb signing even if explicitly configured.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2115">CVE-2016-2115</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that SMB
    connections for IPC traffic are not integrity-protected.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2118">CVE-2016-2118</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that a
    man-in-the-middle attacker can intercept any DCERPC traffic between
    a client and a server in order to impersonate the client and obtain
    the same privileges as the authenticated user account.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is not affected
by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2113">CVE-2016-2113</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2114">CVE-2016-2114</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.2.10+dfsg-0+deb8u1. The issues were addressed by upgrading
to the new upstream version 4.2.10, which includes additional changes
and bugfixes. The depending libraries ldb, talloc, tdb and tevent
required as well an update to new upstream versions for this update.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.3.7+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We'd like to thank Andreas Schneider and Guenther Deschner (Red Hat),
Stefan Metzmacher and Ralph Boehme (SerNet) and Aurelien Aptel (SUSE)
for the massive backporting work required to support Samba 3.6 and Samba
4.2 and Andrew Bartlett (Catalyst), Jelmer Vernooij and Mathieu Parent
for their help in preparing updates of Samba and the underlying
infrastructure libraries.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
