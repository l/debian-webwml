<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Pascal Cuoq and Miod Vallat discovered that Libtasn1, a library to
manage ASN.1 structures, does not correctly handle certain malformed DER
certificates. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause
an application using the Libtasn1 library to hang, resulting in a denial
of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-3+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.8-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.</p>
