<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.4, a SQL
database system.</p>

    <p>Karthikeyan Jambu Rajaraman discovered that nested CASE-WHEN
    expressions are not properly evaluated, potentially leading to a
    crash or allowing to disclose portions of server memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5424">CVE-2016-5424</a>

    <p>Nathan Bossart discovered that special characters in database and
    role names are not properly handled, potentially leading to the
    execution of commands with superuser privileges, when a superuser
    executes pg_dumpall or other routine maintenance operations.</p></li>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
