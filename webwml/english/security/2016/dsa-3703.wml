<p>Tony Finch and Marco Davids reported an assertion failure in BIND, a
DNS server implementation, which causes the server process to
terminate.  This denial-of-service vulnerability is related to a
defect in the processing of responses with DNAME records from
authoritative servers and primarily affects recursive resolvers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
