<p>This update fixes the CVEs described below.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8812">CVE-2015-8812</a>

    <p>A flaw was found in the iw_cxgb3 Infiniband driver.  Whenever it
    could not send a packet because the network was congested, it
    would free the packet buffer but later attempt to send the packet
    again.  This use-after-free could result in a denial of service
    (crash or hang), data loss or privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774">CVE-2016-0774</a>

    <p>It was found that the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a> in kernel versions
    older than Linux 3.16 did not correctly handle the case of a
    partially failed atomic read.  A local, unprivileged user could
    use this flaw to crash the system or leak kernel memory to user
    space.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2384">CVE-2016-2384</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov found that a USB MIDI device with an invalid USB
    descriptor could trigger a double-free.  This may be used by a
    physically present user for privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, it fixes some old security issues with no CVE ID:</p>

    <p>Several kernel APIs permitted reading or writing 2 GiB of data or
    more in a single chunk, which could lead to an integer overflow
    when applied to certain filesystems, socket or device types.  The
    full security impact has not been evaluated.</p>

<p>Finally, it fixes a regression in 2.6.32-48squeeze17 that would cause
Samba to hang in some situations.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze20.  This is *really* the final
update to the linux-2.6 package for squeeze.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), the kernel was not affected
by the integer overflow issues and the remaining problems will be
fixed in version 3.2.73-2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), the kernel was not affected by
the integer overflow issues or <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0774">CVE-2016-0774</a>, and the remaining
problems will be fixed in version 3.16.7-ckt20-1+deb8u4.</p>
