<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in JasPer, a library for
manipulating JPEG-2000 files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1577">CVE-2016-1577</a>

    <p>Jacob Baines discovered a double-free flaw in the
    jas_iccattrval_destroy function. A remote attacker could exploit
    this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library to crash,
    or potentially, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the
    user running the application.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2089">CVE-2016-2089</a>

    <p>The Qihoo 360 Codesafe Team discovered a NULL pointer dereference
    flaw within the jas_matrix_clip function. A remote attacker could
    exploit this flaw to cause an application using the JasPer library
    to crash, resulting in a denial-of-service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2116">CVE-2016-2116</a>

    <p>Tyler Hicks discovered a memory leak flaw in the
    jas_iccprof_createfrombuf function. A remote attacker could exploit
    this flaw to cause the JasPer library to consume memory, resulting
    in a denial-of-service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-debian1-2.4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.</p>
