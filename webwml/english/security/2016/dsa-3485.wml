<p>Alexander Izmailov discovered that didiwiki, a wiki implementation,
failed to correctly validate user-supplied input, thus allowing a
malicious user to access any part of the filesystem.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.5-11+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-11+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 0.5-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your didiwiki packages.</p>
