<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in NSS, the cryptography
library developed by the Mozilla project.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000">CVE-2015-4000</a>

    <p>David Adrian et al. reported that it may be feasible to attack
    Diffie-Hellman-based cipher suites in certain circumstances,
    compromising the confidentiality and integrity of data encrypted
    with Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7181">CVE-2015-7181</a>
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7182">CVE-2015-7182</a>
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1950">CVE-2016-1950</a>

    <p>Tyson Smith, David Keeler, and Francis Gabriel discovered
    heap-based buffer overflows in the ASN.1 DER parser, potentially
    leading to arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7575">CVE-2015-7575</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that TLS client implementation
    accepted MD5-based signatures for TLS 1.2 connections with forward
    secrecy, weakening the intended security strength of TLS
    connections.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1938">CVE-2016-1938</a>

    <p>Hanno Boeck discovered that NSS miscomputed the result of integer
    division for certain inputs.  This could weaken the cryptographic
    protections provided by NSS.  However, NSS implements RSA-CRT leak
    hardening, so RSA private keys are not directly disclosed by this
    issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1978">CVE-2016-1978</a>

    <p>Eric Rescorla discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
    implementation of ECDH-based TLS handshakes, with unknown
    consequences.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1979">CVE-2016-1979</a>

    <p>Tim Taubert discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in ASN.1 DER
    processing, with application-specific impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2834">CVE-2016-2834</a>

    <p>Tyson Smith and Jed Davis discovered unspecified memory-safety
    bugs in NSS.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, the NSS library did not ignore environment variables in
processes which underwent a SUID/SGID/AT_SECURE transition at process
start.  In certain system configurations, this allowed local users to
escalate their privileges.</p>

<p>This update contains further correctness and stability fixes without
immediate security impact.</p></li>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.26-1+debu8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.23-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
