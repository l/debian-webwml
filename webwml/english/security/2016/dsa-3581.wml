<p>Julien Bernard discovered that libndp, a library for the IPv6 Neighbor
Discovery Protocol, does not properly perform input and origin checks
during the reception of a NDP message. An attacker in a non-local
network could use this flaw to advertise a node as a router, and cause a
denial of service attack, or act as a man-in-the-middle.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libndp packages.</p>
