<p>It was discovered that unplugging one of the monitors in a multi-monitor
setup can cause xscreensaver to crash.  Someone with physical access to
a machine could use this problem to bypass a locked session.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.15-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.30-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 5.34-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xscreensaver packages.</p>
