<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2119">CVE-2016-2119</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher discovered that client-side SMB2/3 required
    signing can be downgraded, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to
    impersonate a server being connected to by Samba, and return
    malicious results.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2123">CVE-2016-2123</a>

    <p>Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative and Frederic Besler discovered
    that the routine ndr_pull_dnsp_name, used to parse data from the
    Samba Active Directory ldb database, contains an integer overflow
    flaw, leading to an attacker-controlled memory overwrite. An
    authenticated user can take advantage of this flaw for remote
    privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2125">CVE-2016-2125</a>

    <p>Simo Sorce of Red Hat discovered that the Samba client code always
    requests a forwardable ticket when using Kerberos authentication. A
    target server, which must be in the current or trusted domain/realm,
    is given a valid general purpose Kerberos <q>Ticket Granting Ticket</q>
    (TGT), which can be used to fully impersonate the authenticated user
    or service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2126">CVE-2016-2126</a>

    <p>Volker Lendecke discovered several flaws in the Kerberos PAC
    validation. A remote, authenticated, attacker can cause the winbindd
    process to crash using a legitimate Kerberos ticket due to incorrect
    handling of the PAC checksum. A local service with access to the
    winbindd privileged pipe can cause winbindd to cache elevated access
    permissions.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u2. In addition, this update contains
several changes originally targeted for the upcoming jessie point
release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
