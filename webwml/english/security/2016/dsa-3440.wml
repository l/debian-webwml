<p>When sudo is configured to allow a user to edit files under a directory
that they can already write to without using sudo, they can actually
edit (read and write) arbitrary files. Daniel Svartman reported that a
configuration like this might be introduced unintentionally if the
editable files are specified using wildcards, for example:</p>

    <p>operator ALL=(root) sudoedit /home/*/*/test.txt</p>

<p>The default behaviour of sudo has been changed so that it does not allow
editing of a file in a directory that the user can write to, or that is
reached by following a symlink in a directory that the user can write
to. These restrictions can be disabled, but this is strongly
discouraged.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.5p2-1+nmu3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10p3-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.15-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.15-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.</p>
