<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that Tor treats the contents of some buffer
chunks as if they were a NUL-terminated string.  This issue could
enable a remote attacker to crash a Tor client, hidden service, relay,
or authority.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5.12-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.9-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.9.4-alpha-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
