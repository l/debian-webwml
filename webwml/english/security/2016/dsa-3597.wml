<p>Two related issues have been discovered in Expat, a C library for parsing
XML.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6702">CVE-2012-6702</a>

    <p>It was introduced when 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876">CVE-2012-0876</a> 
    was addressed. Stefan SÃ¸rensen discovered that the use of the function 
    XML_Parse() seeds the random number generator generating repeated outputs 
    for rand() calls.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5300">CVE-2016-5300</a>

    <p>It is the product of an incomplete solution for 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0876">CVE-2012-0876</a>. 
    The parser poorly seeds the random number generator allowing an attacker to 
    cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via an XML file with crafted 
    identifiers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>You might need to manually restart programs and services using expat
libraries.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-6+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.</p>
