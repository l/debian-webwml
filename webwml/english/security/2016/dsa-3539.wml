<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Randell Jesup and the Firefox team discovered that srtp, Cisco's
reference implementation of the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol
(SRTP), does not properly handle RTP header CSRC count and extension
header length. A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash
an application linked against libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.</p>
