<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kostya Kortchinsky discovered a stack-based buffer overflow
vulnerability in the VPNv4 NLRI parser in bgpd in quagga, a BGP/OSPF/RIP
routing daemon. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash), or potentially, execution of arbitrary
code, if bgpd is configured with BGP peers enabled for VPNv4.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.99.22.4-1+wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.23.1-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
