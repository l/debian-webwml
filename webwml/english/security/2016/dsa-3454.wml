<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in VirtualBox, an x86
virtualisation solution.</p>

<p>Upstream support for the 4.1 release series has ended and since no
information is available which would allow backports of isolated security
fixes, security support for virtualbox in wheezy/oldstable needed to be
ended as well.
If you use virtualbox with externally procured VMs (e.g. through vagrant)
we advise you to update to Debian jessie.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.36-dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.14-dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.14-dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your virtualbox packages.</p>
