<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Prosody, a lightweight
Jabber/XMPP server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1231">CVE-2016-1231</a>

    <p>Kim Alvefur discovered a flaw in Prosody's HTTP file-serving module
    that allows it to serve requests outside of the configured public
    root directory. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to access
    private files including sensitive data. The default configuration
    does not enable the mod_http_files module and thus is not
    vulnerable.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1232">CVE-2016-1232</a>

    <p>Thijs Alkemade discovered that Prosody's generation of the secret
    token for server-to-server dialback authentication relied upon a
    weak random number generator that was not cryptographically secure.
    A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to guess at
    probable values of the secret key and impersonate the affected
    domain to other servers on the network.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.2-4+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your prosody packages.</p>
