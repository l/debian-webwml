<p>Blake Burkhart discovered that the Git git-remote-ext helper incorrectly
handled recursive clones of git repositories. A remote attacker could
possibly use this issue to execute arbitary code by injecting commands
via crafted URLs.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.7.10.4-1+wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.6.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.6.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.</p>
