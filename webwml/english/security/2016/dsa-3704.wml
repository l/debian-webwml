<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered several integer overflow
vulnerabilities in memcached, a high-performance memory object caching
system. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash), or potentially to execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.21-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.</p>
