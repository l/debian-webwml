<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>GOsa is a combination of system-administrator and end-user web interface,
designed to handle LDAP based setups.</p>

<p>GOsa upstream reported a code injection vulnerability in the Samba plugin
code of GOsa. During Samba password changes it has been possible to
inject malicious Perl code.</p>

<p>This upload to Debian Squeeze LTS fixes this issues. However, if you
upgrade to this fixed package revision, please note that Samba password
changes will stop working until the sambaHashHook parameter in gosa.conf
has been updated to accept base64 encoded password strings from the PHP
code of GOsa.</p>

<p>Please read /usr/share/doc/gosa/NEWS.gz and the gosa.conf (5) man page
after you have upgraded to this package revision and adapt gosa.conf as
described there.</p>
