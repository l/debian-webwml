<p>Shayan Sadigh discovered a vulnerability in OpenSSH: If PAM support is
enabled and the sshd PAM configuration is configured to read userspecified
environment variables and the <q>UseLogin</q> option is enabled, a
local user may escalate her privileges to root.</p>

<p>In Debian <q>UseLogin</q> is not enabled by default.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 6.0p1-4+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.7p1-5+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.2p2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.</p>
