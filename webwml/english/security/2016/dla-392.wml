<p>High-Tech Bridge Security Research Lab discovered a path traversal
vulnerability in a popular webmail client Roundcube. Vulnerability can be
exploited to gain access to sensitive information and under certain
circumstances to execute arbitrary code and totally compromise the vulnerable
server.</p>

<p>The vulnerability exists due to insufficient sanitization of <q>_skin</q> HTTP POST
parameter in "/index.php" script when changing between different skins of the
web application. A remote authenticated attacker can use path traversal
sequences (e.g. "../../") to load a new skin from arbitrary location on the
system, readable by the webserver.</p>
