<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The flaw allows a malicious server to impersonate the vulnerable domain
to any XMPP domain whose domain name includes the attacker's domain as a
suffix.</p>

<p>For example, <q>bber.example</q> would be able to connect to <q>jabber.example</q>
and successfully impersonate any vulnerable server on the network.</p>

<p>This release also fixes a regression introduced in the previous
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1232">CVE-2016-1232</a> fix: s2s doesn't work if /dev/urandom is read-only.</p>
