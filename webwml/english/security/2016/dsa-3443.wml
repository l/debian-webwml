<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libpng PNG library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8472">CVE-2015-8472</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the original fix for
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126">\
    CVE-2015-8126</a> was
    incomplete and did not detect a potential overrun by applications
    using png_set_PLTE directly. A remote attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8540">CVE-2015-8540</a>

    <p>Xiao Qixue and Chen Yu discovered a flaw in the png_check_keyword
    function. A remote attacker can potentially take advantage of this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.49-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.50-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
