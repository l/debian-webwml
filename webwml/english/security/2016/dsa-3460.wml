<p>It was discovered that privoxy, a web proxy with advanced filtering
capabilities, contained invalid reads that could enable a remote
attacker to crash the application, thus causing a Denial of Service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.19-2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.21-7+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 3.0.24-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your privoxy packages.</p>
