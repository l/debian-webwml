<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
same-origin policy bypass issues, integer overflows, buffer overflows
and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.5.1-1 or earlier.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
