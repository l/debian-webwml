<p>The TERASOLUNA Framework Development Team discovered a denial of service
vulnerability in Apache Commons FileUpload, a package to make it
easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to servlets
and web applications. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
by sending file upload requests that cause the HTTP server using the
Apache Commons Fileupload library to become unresponsive, preventing the
server from servicing other requests.</p>

<p>Apache Tomcat uses a package renamed copy of Apache Commons FileUpload
to implement the file upload requirements of the Servlet specification
and is therefore also vulnerable to the denial of service vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0.56-3+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 7.0.70-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0.70-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.</p>
