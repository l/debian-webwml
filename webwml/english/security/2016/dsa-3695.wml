<p>It was discovered that the zebra daemon in the Quagga routing suite
suffered from a stack-based buffer overflow when processing IPv6
Neighbor Discovery messages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.23.1-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
