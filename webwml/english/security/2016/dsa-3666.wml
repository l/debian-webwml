<p>Dawid Golunski discovered that the mysqld_safe wrapper provided by the
MySQL database server insufficiently restricted the load path for custom
malloc implementations, which could result in privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was addressed by upgrading MySQL to the new upstream
version 5.5.52, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible
changes. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:</p>

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-52.html</a></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.52-0+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.</p>
