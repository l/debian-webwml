<p>It was discovered that there was a invalid pointer deference in nginx, a
small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server.  An invalid pointer
dereference might occur during DNS server response processing, allowing
an attacker who is able to forge UDP packets from the DNS server to cause
worker process crash</p>

<p>For Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in nginx version
0.7.67-3+squeeze4+deb6u1.</p>
