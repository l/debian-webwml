<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. A remote attacker can
take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using the libgd2 library (application crash), or potentially
to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.2-29-g3c2b605-1 or earlier.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
