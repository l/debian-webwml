<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the resolver in nginx, a
small, powerful, scalable web/proxy server, leading to denial of service
or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution. These only affect nginx if
the <q>resolver</q> directive is used in a configuration file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.9.10-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
