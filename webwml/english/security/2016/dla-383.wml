<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"DrWhax" of the Tails project reported that Claws Mail is missing
range checks in some text conversion functions.  A remote attacker
could exploit this to run arbitrary code under the account of a user
that receives a message from them using Claws Mail.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8614">CVE-2015-8614</a>

    <p>There were no checks on the output length for conversions between
    JIS (ISO-2022-JP) and EUC-JP, between JIS and UTF-8, and from
    Shift_JIS to EUC-JP.</p></li>

    <p>The original fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8614">CVE-2015-8614</a> was incomplete.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.7.6-4+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and the stable distribution
(jessie), this will be fixed soon.  These versions were built with
hardening features that make this issue harder to exploit.</p>
