<p>An issue had been discovered and resolved by the libvncserver upstream
developer Karl Runge addressing thread-safety in libvncserver when
libvncserver is used for handling multiple VNC connections [1].</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not trivially feasible (because of ABI breakage) to
backport the related patch to libvncserver 0.9.7 as shipped in Debian
squeeze(-lts).</p>

<p>However, the thread-safety patch discussed resolved a related issue of
memory corruption caused by freeing global variables without nullifying
them when reusing them in another <q>thread</q>, especially occurring when
libvncserver is used for handling multiple VNC connections</p>

<p>The described issue has been resolved with this version of libvncserver
and users of VNC are recommended to upgrade to this version of the
package.</p>
