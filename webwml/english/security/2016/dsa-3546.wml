<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hans Jerry Illikainen discovered that missing input sanitising in the
BMP processing code of the optipng PNG optimiser may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed file is
processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.6.4-1+deb7u2. This update also fixes <a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7801">CVE-2015-7801</a>,
which was originally targeted for a wheezy point update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.5-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your optipng packages.</p>
