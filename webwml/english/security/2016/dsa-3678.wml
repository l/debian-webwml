<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sergey Bobrov discovered that cookie parsing in Django and Google
Analytics interacted such a way that an attacker could set arbitrary
cookies.  This allows other malicious web sites to bypass the
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections built into Django.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.11-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
