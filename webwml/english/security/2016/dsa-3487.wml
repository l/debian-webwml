<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andreas Schneider reported that libssh2, a SSH2 client-side library,
passes the number of bytes to a function that expects number of bits
during the SSHv2 handshake when libssh2 is to get a suitable value for
<q>group order</q> in the Diffie-Hellman negotiation. This weakens
significantly the handshake security, potentially allowing an
eavesdropper with enough resources to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.2-1.1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-4.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.</p>
