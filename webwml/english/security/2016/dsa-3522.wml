<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alex Rousskov from The Measurement Factory discovered that Squid3, a
fully featured web proxy cache, does not properly handle errors for
certain malformed HTTP responses. A remote HTTP server can exploit this
flaw to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.5.15-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
