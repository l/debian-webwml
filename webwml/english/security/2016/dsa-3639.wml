<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool, which could allow remote attackers to compromise a site via
cross-site scripting, bypass restrictions, obtain sensitive
revision-history information, or mount a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
