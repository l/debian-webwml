<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andreas Schneider reported that libssh2, an SSH2 protocol
implementation used by many applications, did not generate
sufficiently long Diffie-Hellman secrets.</p>

<p>This vulnerability could be exploited by an eavesdropper to decrypt
and to intercept SSH sessions.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this has been fixed in
version 1.2.6-1+deb6u2.  Although the changelog refers to <q>sha256</q>,
this version only supports DH SHA-1 key exchange and it is that key
exchange method that has been fixed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie) distributions, this
will be fixed soon.</p>
