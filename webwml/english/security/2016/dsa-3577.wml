<p>Gustavo Grieco discovered that jansson, a C library for encoding,
decoding and manipulating JSON data, did not limit the recursion depth
when parsing JSON arrays and objects. This could allow remote attackers
to cause a denial of service (crash) via stack exhaustion, using crafted
JSON data.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jansson packages.</p>
