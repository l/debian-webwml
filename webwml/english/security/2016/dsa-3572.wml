<p>Nitin Venkatesh discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, is susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks via
specially crafted file and directory names in repositories.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.</p>
