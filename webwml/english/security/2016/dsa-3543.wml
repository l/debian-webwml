<p>Emmanuel Thome discovered that missing sanitising in the oarsh command
of OAR, a software used to manage jobs and resources of HPC clusters,
could result in privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.2-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.4-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your oar packages.</p>
