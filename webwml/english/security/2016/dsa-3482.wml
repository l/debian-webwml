<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An anonymous contributor working with VeriSign iDefense Labs
discovered that libreoffice, a full-featured office productivity
suite, did not correctly handle Lotus WordPro files. This would enable
an attacker to crash the program, or execute arbitrary code, by
supplying a specially crafted LWP file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.3-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 1:5.0.5~rc1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>
