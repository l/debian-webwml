<p>An anonymous contributor working with VeriSign iDefense Labs
discovered that libreoffice, a full-featured office productivity
suite, did not correctly handle Lotus WordPro files. This would enable
an attacker to crash the program, or execute arbitrary code, by
supplying a specially crafted LWP file.

For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u6.

For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.3-2+deb8u3.

For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 1:5.0.5~rc1-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </p>
