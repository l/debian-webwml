<p>Andreas Cord-Landwehr discovered that kde4libs, the core libraries
for all KDE 4 applications, do not properly handle the extraction
of archives with "../" in the file paths. A remote attacker can
take advantage of this flaw to overwrite files outside of the
extraction folder, if a user is tricked into extracting a specially
crafted archive.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.14.22-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.</p>
