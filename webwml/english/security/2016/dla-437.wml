<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Upstream published version 0.99.  This update updates sqeeze-lts to the latest
upstream release in line with the approach used for other Debian releases.</p>

<p>The changes are not strictly required for operation, but users of the previous
version in Squeeze may not be able to make use of all current virus signatures
and might get warnings.</p>

<p>Due to a change in soname included with this release, libclamav has been
updated to libclamav7.  This requires updates to external users of libclamav.
For python-clamav, klamav, and libclamunrar, these changes are, or will be
shortly, available.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for dansguardian, it was released for squeeze with latent
issues that preclude rebuilding the package.  If you are using dansguardian,
do not attempt to upgrade to the new clamav.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if you use clamav, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to this
version.</p>
