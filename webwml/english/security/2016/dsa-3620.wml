<p>Yves Younan of Cisco Talos discovered several vulnerabilities in the
MXit protocol support in pidgin, a multi-protocol instant messaging
client. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to cause a
denial of service (application crash), overwrite files, information
disclosure, or potentially to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.0-0+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.11.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.</p>
