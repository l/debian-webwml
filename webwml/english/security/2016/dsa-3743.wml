<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that bottle, a WSGI-framework for the Python
programming language, did not properly filter "\r\n" sequences when
handling redirections. This allowed an attacker to perform CRLF
attacks such as HTTP header injection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.7-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 0.12.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.</p>
