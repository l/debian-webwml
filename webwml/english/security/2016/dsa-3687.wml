<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were reported in NSPR, a library to abstract over
operating system interfaces developed by the Mozilla project.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1951">CVE-2016-1951</a>

    <p>q1 reported that the NSPR implementation of sprintf-style string
    formatting function miscomputed memory allocation sizes,
    potentially leading to heap-based buffer overflows</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The second issue concerns environment variable processing in NSPR.
The library did not ignore environment variables used to configuring
logging and tracing in processes which underwent a SUID/SGID/AT_SECURE
transition at process start.  In certain system configurations, this
allowed local users to escalate their privileges.</p>

<p>In addition, this nspr update contains further stability and
correctness fixes and contains support code for an upcoming nss
update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:4.12-1+debu8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nspr packages.</p>
