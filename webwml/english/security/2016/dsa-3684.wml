<p>Pali Rohar discovered that libdbd-mysql-perl, the Perl DBI database
driver for MySQL and MariaDB, constructed an error message in a
fixed-length buffer, leading to a crash (_FORTIFY_SOURCE failure) and,
potentially, to denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.028-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.</p>
