<p>It was discovered that specific APL RR data could trigger an INSIST
failure in apl_42.c and cause the BIND DNS server to exit, leading to a
denial-of-service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
