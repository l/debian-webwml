<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in Samba, a SMB/CIFS implementation
that provides a file, print, and login server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252">CVE-2015-5252</a>

    <p>Jan <q>Yenya</q> Kasprzak and the Computer Systems Unit team at Faculty
    of Informatics, Masaryk University, reported that samba wrongly
    verified symlinks, making it possible to access resources outside
    the shared path, under certain circumstances.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5296">CVE-2015-5296</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet and the Samba Team discovered that samba
    did not ensure that signing was negotiated when a client established
    an encrypted connection against a samba server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5299">CVE-2015-5299</a>

    <p>Samba was vulnerable to a missing access control check in the
    VFS shadow_copy2 module, that could allow unauthorized users to
    access snapshots.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, this issue has been fixed in samba version
2:3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze13. We recommend you to upgrade your samba
packages.</p>
