<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2167">CVE-2016-2167</a>

    <p>Daniel Shahaf and James McCoy discovered that an implementation
    error in the authentication against the Cyrus SASL library would
    permit a remote user to specify a realm string which is a prefix of
    the expected realm string and potentially allowing a user to
    authenticate using the wrong realm.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2168">CVE-2016-2168</a>

    <p>Ivan Zhakov of VisualSVN discovered a remotely triggerable denial
    of service vulnerability in the mod_authz_svn module during COPY or
    MOVE authorization check. An authenticated remote attacker could
    take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (Subversion server crash) via COPY or MOVE requests with specially
    crafted header.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
