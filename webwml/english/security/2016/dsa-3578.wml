<p>It was discovered that libidn, the GNU library for Internationalized
Domain Names (IDNs), did not correctly handle invalid UTF-8 input,
causing an out-of-bounds read. This could allow attackers to disclose
sensitive information from an application using the libidn library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.29-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.31-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.31-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libidn packages.</p>
