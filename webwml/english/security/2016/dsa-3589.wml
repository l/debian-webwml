<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in gdk-pixbuf, a toolkit
for image loading and pixel buffer manipulation. A remote attacker can
take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using gdk-pixbuf (application crash), or potentially, to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application, if a malformed image is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.31.1-2+deb8u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.</p>
