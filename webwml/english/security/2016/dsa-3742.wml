<p>It was discovered that the Flight Gear flight simulator performs
insufficient sanitising of Nasal scripts which allows a malicious script
to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
Flight Gear.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.0-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2016.4.3+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flightgear packages.</p>
