<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The s_mp_div function in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before
3.21, improperly divides numbers, which might make it easier for remote
attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging
use of the (1) mp_div or (2) mp_exptmod function.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problem has been fixed
in version 3.12.8-1+squeeze14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
