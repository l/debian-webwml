<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security flaws have been found and solved in libtiff, a
library that provides support for handling Tag Image File Format
(TIFF). These flaws concern out of bounds reads and writes in the
LogL16Decode, LogLuvDecode24, LogLuvDecode32, LogLuvDecodeTile,
LogL16Encode, LogLuvEncode24, LogLuvEncode32 and NeXTDecode functions.</p>

<p>These IDs were assigned for the problems: <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8781">CVE-2015-8781</a>,
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8782">CVE-2015-8782</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8783">CVE-2015-8783</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8784">CVE-2015-8784</a>.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in tiff version
3.9.4-5+squeeze14. We recommend you to upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
