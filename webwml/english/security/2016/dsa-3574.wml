<p>Rock Stevens, Andrew Ruef and Marcin <q>Icewall</q> Noga discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the zip_read_mac_metadata
function in libarchive, a multi-format archive and compression library,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a user or automated
system is tricked into processing a specially crafted ZIP file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.2-11+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libarchive packages.</p>
