<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ralf Schlatterbeck discovered an information leak in roundup, a
web-based issue tracking system. An authenticated attacker could use it
to see sensitive details about other users, including their hashed
password.</p>

<p>After applying the update, which will fix the shipped templates, the
site administrator should ensure the instanced versions (in
/var/lib/roundup usually) are also updated, either by patching them
manually or by recreating them.</p>

<p>More info can be found in the upstream documentation at
<a href="http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html#user-data-visibility">http://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html#user-data-visibility</a></p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.20-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.20-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem has not
yet been fixed.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundup packages.</p>
