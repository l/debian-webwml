<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in the Debian GNU C Library,
eglibc:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7547">CVE-2015-7547</a>

    <p>The Google Security Team and Red Hat discovered that the glibc
    host name resolver function, getaddrinfo, when processing
    AF_UNSPEC queries (for dual A/AAAA lookups), could mismange its
    internal buffers, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
    arbitrary code execution.  This vulnerability affects most
    applications which perform host name resolution using getaddrinfo,
    including system services.</p>

<p>The following fixed vulnerabilities currently lack CVE assignment:</p>

    <p>Andreas Schwab reported a memory leak (memory allocation without a
    matching deallocation) while processing certain DNS answers in
    getaddrinfo, related to the _nss_dns_gethostbyname4_r function.
    This vulnerability could lead to a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in eglibc version
eglibc_2.11.3-4+deb6u11. In addition this version corrects the fix for
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9761">CVE-2014-9761</a> in Squeeze, which have wrongly marked a few symbols as
public instead of private.</p>

<p>While it is only necessary to ensure that all processes are not using
the old eglibc anymore, it is recommended to reboot the machines after
applying the security upgrade.</p>

<p>We recommend you to upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>
