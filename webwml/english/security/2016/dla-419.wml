<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gtk+2.0, a graphical user interface library, was susceptible to an integer
overflow in its gdk_cairo_set_source_pixbuf function when allocating a
large block of memory.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, this issue has been fixed in gtk+2.0 version
2.20.1-2+deb6u1. We recommend you to upgrade your gtk+2.0 packages.</p>
