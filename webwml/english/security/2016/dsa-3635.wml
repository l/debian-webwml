<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered in DBD::mysql, a Perl
DBI driver for the MySQL database server. A remote attacker can take
advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using DBD::mysql (application crash), or potentially to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.028-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-mysql-perl packages.</p>
