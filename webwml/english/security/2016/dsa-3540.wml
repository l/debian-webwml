<p>Marcin Noga discovered an integer underflow in Lhasa, a lzh archive
decompressor, which might result in the execution of arbitrary code if
a malformed archive is processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.0.7-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.0+git3fe46-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.3.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lhasa packages.</p>
