<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative
DNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5426">CVE-2016-5426</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5427">CVE-2016-5427</a>

    <p>Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that the PowerDNS
    Authoritative Server accepts queries with a qname's length larger
    than 255 bytes and does not properly handle dot inside labels. A
    remote, unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of these flaws
    to cause abnormal load on the PowerDNS backend by sending specially
    crafted DNS queries, potentially leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6172">CVE-2016-6172</a>

    <p>It was reported that a malicious primary DNS server can crash a
    secondary PowerDNS server due to improper restriction of zone size
    limits. This update adds a feature to limit AXFR sizes in response
    to this flaw.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.</p>
