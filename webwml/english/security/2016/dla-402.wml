<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security flaws have been found and solved in libtiff, library that provides
support for handling Tag Image File Format (TIFF). These flaws concern out of
bounds reads in the TIFFRGBAImage interface, when parsing unsupported values
related to LogLUV and CIELab. <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8665">CVE-2015-8665</a> was reported by limingxing and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8683">CVE-2015-8683</a> by zzf of Alibaba.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in tiff version
3.9.4-5+squeeze13. We recommend you to upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
