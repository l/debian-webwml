<p>It was discovered that libstruts1.2-java, a Java framework for MVC
applications, contains a bug in its multi-page validation code. This
allows input validation to be bypassed, even if MPV is not used
directly.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.9-5+deb7u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libstruts1.2-java packages.</p>
