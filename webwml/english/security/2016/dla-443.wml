<p>A remote code execution vulnerability was found in BeanShell, an
embeddable Java source interpreter with object scripting language
features.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2510">CVE-2016-2510</a>:

        <p>An application that includes BeanShell on the classpath may be
        vulnerable if another part of the application uses Java
        serialization or XStream to deserialize data from an untrusted
        source. A vulnerable application could be exploited for remote
        code execution, including executing arbitrary shell commands.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in version
2.0b4-12+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bsh packages.</p>
