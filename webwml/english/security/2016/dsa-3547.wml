<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Imagemagick, a program suite for
image manipulation. This update fixes a large number of potential security
problems such as null-pointer access and buffer-overflows that might lead
to memory leaks or denial of service. Any of these security problems have
a CVE number assigned.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem was already fixed in
version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u1, in the last point release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
