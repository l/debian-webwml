<p>"DrWhax" of the Tails project reported that Claws Mail is missing
range checks in some text conversion functions.  A remote attacker
could exploit this to run arbitrary code under the account of a user
that receives a message from them using Claws Mail.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.8.1-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.11.1-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your claws-mail packages.</p>
