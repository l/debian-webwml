<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that inspircd, an IRC daemon, incorrectly handled
PTR lookups of connecting users. This flaw allowed a remote attacker
to crash the application by setting up malformed DNS records, thus
causing a denial-of-service,</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.5-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.17-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2.0.20-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.</p>
