<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8629">CVE-2015-8629</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to read beyond the end of allocated memory by sending a string
    without a terminating zero byte. Information leakage may be possible
    for an attacker with permission to modify the database.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630">CVE-2015-8630</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an authenticated attacker with permission to
    modify a principal entry can cause kadmind to dereference a null
    pointer by supplying a null policy value but including KADM5_POLICY
    in the mask.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8631">CVE-2015-8631</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an authenticated attacker can cause kadmind
    to leak memory by supplying a null principal name in a request which
    uses one. Repeating these requests will eventually cause kadmind to
    exhaust all available memory.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u7. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is
not affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8630">CVE-2015-8630</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
