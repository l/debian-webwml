<p>RÃ©gis Leroy from Makina Corpus discovered that varnish, a caching HTTP
reverse proxy, is vulnerable to HTTP smuggling issues, potentially
resulting in cache poisoning or bypassing of access control policies.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.0.2-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.</p>
