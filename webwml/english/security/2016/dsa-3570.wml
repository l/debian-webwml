<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Blake Burkhart discovered an arbitrary code execution flaw in
Mercurial, a distributed version control system, when using the convert
extension on Git repositories with specially crafted names. This flaw in
particular affects automated code conversion services that allow
arbitrary repository names.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.2-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.</p>
