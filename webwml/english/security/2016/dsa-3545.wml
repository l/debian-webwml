these flaws to perform cross-site scripting, header injection or denial
of service attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.2.git2.0.1-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.12.0.git2.7.0-1 or earlier.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.0.git2.7.0-1 or earlier.</p>
