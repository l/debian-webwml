<p>Two vulnerabilities were reported in BIND, a DNS server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2775">CVE-2016-2775</a>

    <p>The lwresd component in BIND (which is not enabled by default)
    could crash while processing an overlong request name.  This could
    lead to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2776">CVE-2016-2776</a>

    <p>A crafted query could crash the BIND name server daemon, leading
    to a denial of service.  All server roles (authoritative,
    recursive and forwarding) in default configurations are are
    affected.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
