<p>David Golden of MongoDB discovered that File::Spec::canonpath() in Perl
returned untainted strings even if passed tainted input. This defect
undermines taint propagation, which is sometimes used to ensure that
unvalidated user input does not reach sensitive code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.20.2-3+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
