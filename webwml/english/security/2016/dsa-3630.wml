<p>Secunia Research at Flexera Software discovered an integer overflow
vulnerability within the _gdContributionsAlloc() function in libgd2, a
library for programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial-of-service
against an application using the libgd2 library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-43-g22cba39-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
