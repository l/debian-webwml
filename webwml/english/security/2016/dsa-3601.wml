<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.</p>

<p>Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird. Support
for the 38.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 45.x releases.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:45.1.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:45.1.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
