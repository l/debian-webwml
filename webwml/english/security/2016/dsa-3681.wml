<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging tool,
which could allow remote attackers to compromise a site via cross-site
scripting, cross-site request forgery, path traversal, or bypass restrictions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
