<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in GraphicsMagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can cause denial of service
attacks, remote file deletion, and remote command execution.</p>

<p>This security update removes the full support of PLT/Gnuplot decoder to
prevent Gnuplot-shell based shell exploits for fixing the
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3714">CVE-2016-3714</a>
vulnerability.</p>

<p>The undocumented <q>TMP</q> magick prefix no longer removes the argument file
after it has been read for fixing the
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3715">CVE-2016-3715</a>
vulnerability. Since the <q>TMP</q> feature was originally implemented,
GraphicsMagick added a temporary file management subsystem which assures
that temporary files are removed so this feature is not needed.</p>

<p>Remove support for reading input from a shell command, or writing output
to a shell command, by prefixing the specified filename (containing the
command) with a '|' for fixing the
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-5118">CVE-2016-5118</a>
vulnerability.</p>
