<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jann Horn discovered a vulnerability in the fuse (Filesystem in
Userspace) package in Debian. The fuse package ships an udev rule
adjusting permissions on the related /dev/cuse character device, making
it world writable.</p>

<p>This permits a local, unprivileged attacker to create an
arbitrarily-named character device in /dev and modify the memory of any
process that opens it and performs an ioctl on it.</p>

<p>This in turn might allow a local, unprivileged attacker to escalate to
root privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), the fuse package is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.3-15+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.5-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.</p>
