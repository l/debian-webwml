<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8615">CVE-2016-8615</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a malicious HTTP server could inject new
    cookies for arbitrary domains into a cookie jar.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8616">CVE-2016-8616</a>

    <p>It was discovered that when re-using a connection, curl was doing case
    insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing
    connections.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8617">CVE-2016-8617</a>

    <p>It was discovered that on systems with 32-bit addresses in userspace
    (e.g. x86, ARM, x32), the output buffer size value calculated in the
    base64 encode function would wrap around if input size was at least
    1GB of data, causing an undersized output buffer to be allocated.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8618">CVE-2016-8618</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the curl_maprintf() function could be tricked
    into doing a double-free due to an unsafe size_t multiplication on
    systems using 32 bit size_t variables.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8619">CVE-2016-8619</a>

    <p>It was discovered that that the Kerberos implementation could be
    tricked into doing a double-free when reading one of the length fields
    from a socket.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8620">CVE-2016-8620</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the curl tool's <q>globbing</q> feature could write
    to invalid memory areas when parsing invalid ranges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8621">CVE-2016-8621</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the function curl_getdate could read out of
    bounds when parsing invalid date strings.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8622">CVE-2016-8622</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the URL percent-encoding decode function would
    return a signed 32bit integer variable as length, even though it
    allocated a destination buffer larger than 2GB, which would lead to
    a out-of-bounds write.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8623">CVE-2016-8623</a>

    <p>It was discovered that libcurl could access an already-freed memory
    area due to concurrent access to shared cookies. This could lead to
    a denial of service or disclosure of sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8624">CVE-2016-8624</a>

    <p>It was discovered that curl wouldn't parse the authority component of
    a URL correctly when the host name part ends with a '#' character,
    and could be tricked into connecting to a different host.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.51.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
