<p>Two SQL injection vulnerabilities were discovered in cacti, a web
interface for graphing of monitoring systems. Specially crafted input
can be used by an attacker in parameters of the graphs_new.php script to
execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.8a+dfsg-5+deb7u8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.8b+dfsg-8+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.8f+ds1-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.8f+ds1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.</p>
