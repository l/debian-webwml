<p>Jann Horn discovered that the setuid-root mount.ecryptfs_private helper
in the ecryptfs-utils would mount over any target directory that the
user owns, including a directory in procfs. A local attacker could use
this flaw to escalate his privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 99-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 103-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.</p>
