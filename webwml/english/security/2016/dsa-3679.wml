<p>Lukas Reschke discovered that Apache Jackrabbit, an implementation of
the Content Repository for Java Technology API, did not correctly
check the Content-Type header on HTTP POST requests, enabling
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by malicious web sites.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.6-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jackrabbit packages.</p>
