<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in
the TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used
for signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a
TLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to
conduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an
authenticated TLS client.</p>

https://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u19.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), the testing distribution (stretch)
and the unstable distribution (sid), this issue was already addressed in
version 1.0.1f-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
