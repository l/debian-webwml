<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tomcat 6, an implementation of the Java Servlet and the JavaServer
Pages (JSP) specifications and a pure Java web server environment, was
affected by multiple security issues prior version 6.0.45.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5174">CVE-2015-5174</a>

   <p>Directory traversal vulnerability in RequestUtil.java in Apache
   Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.45, 7.x before 7.0.65, and 8.x before 8.0.27
   allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager
   restrictions and list a parent directory via a /.. (slash dot dot)
   in a pathname used by a web application in a getResource,
   getResourceAsStream, or getResourcePaths call, as demonstrated by
   the $CATALINA_BASE/webapps directory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5345">CVE-2015-5345</a>

   <p>The Mapper component in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.45, 7.x before
   7.0.67, 8.x before 8.0.30, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M2 processes
   redirects before considering security constraints and Filters, which
   allows remote attackers to determine the existence of a directory
   via a URL that lacks a trailing / (slash) character.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5351">CVE-2015-5351</a>

   <p>The Manager and Host Manager applications in Apache Tomcat
   establish sessions and send CSRF tokens for arbitrary new requests,
   which allows remote attackers to bypass a CSRF protection mechanism
   by using a token.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0706">CVE-2016-0706</a>

   <p>Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.45, 7.x before 7.0.68, 8.x before
   8.0.31, and 9.x before 9.0.0.M2 does not place
   org.apache.catalina.manager.StatusManagerServlet on the org/apache
   /catalina/core/RestrictedServlets.properties list, which allows
   remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager
   restrictions and read arbitrary HTTP requests, and consequently
   discover session ID values, via a crafted web application.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0714">CVE-2016-0714</a>

   <p>The session-persistence implementation in Apache Tomcat 6.x before
   6.0.45, 7.x before 7.0.68, 8.x before 8.0.31, and 9.x before
   9.0.0.M2 mishandles session attributes, which allows remote
   authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager restrictions
   and execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a web
   application that places a crafted object in a session.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0763">CVE-2016-0763</a>

   <p>The setGlobalContext method in org/apache/naming/factory
   /ResourceLinkFactory.java in Apache Tomcat does not consider whether
   ResourceLinkFactory.setGlobalContext callers are authorized, which
   allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended SecurityManager
   restrictions and read or write to arbitrary application data, or
   cause a denial of service (application disruption), via a web
   application that sets a crafted global context.</p>


<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in version
6.0.45-1~deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat6 packages.</p>
