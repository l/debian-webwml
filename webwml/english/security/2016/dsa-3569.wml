<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in openafs, an implementation of the
distributed filesystem AFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8312">CVE-2015-8312</a>

    <p>Potential denial of service caused by a bug in the pioctl
    logic allowing a local user to overrun a kernel buffer with a
    single NUL byte.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2860">CVE-2016-2860</a>

    <p>Peter Iannucci discovered that users from foreign Kerberos realms
    can create groups as if they were administrators.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9-2+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.17-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
