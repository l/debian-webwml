<p>Gjoko Krstic of Zero Science Labs discovered that dcmtk, a collection
of libraries implementing the DICOM standard, did not properly handle
the size of data received the network. This could lead to
denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.0-15+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 3.6.1~20160216-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dcmtk packages.</p>
