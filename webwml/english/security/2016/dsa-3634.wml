<p>It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, did not
properly protect redis-cli history files: they were created by default
with world-readable permissions.</p>

<p>Users and systems administrators may want to proactively change
permissions on existing ~/rediscli_history files, instead of waiting
for the updated redis-cli to do so the next time it is run.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 2:3.2.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.</p>
