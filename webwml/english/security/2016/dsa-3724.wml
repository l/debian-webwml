<p>Chris Evans discovered that the GStreamer 0.10 plugin used to decode
files in the FLIC format allowed execution of arbitrary code. Further
details can be found in his advisory at
<a href="https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.de/2016/11/0day-exploit-advancing-exploitation.html">\
https://scarybeastsecurity.blogspot.de/2016/11/0day-exploit-advancing-exploitation.html</a></p>

<p>This update removes the insecure FLIC file format plugin.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.31-3+nmu4+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gst-plugins-good0.10 packages.</p>
