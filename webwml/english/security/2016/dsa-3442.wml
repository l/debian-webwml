<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a maliciously crafted packet can crash any of
the isc-dhcp applications.  This includes the DHCP client, relay, and
server application.  Only IPv4 setups are affected.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.2.2.dfsg.1-5+deb70u8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.1-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.</p>
