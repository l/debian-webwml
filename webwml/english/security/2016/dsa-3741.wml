<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Tor, a connection-based low-latency anonymous
communication system, may read one byte past a buffer when parsing
hidden service descriptors. This issue may enable a hostile hidden
service to crash Tor clients depending on hardening options and malloc
implementation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5.12-4.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 0.2.9.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
