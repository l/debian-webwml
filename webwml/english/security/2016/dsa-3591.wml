<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bob Friesenhahn from the GraphicsMagick project discovered a command
injection vulnerability in ImageMagick, a program suite for image
manipulation. An attacker with control on input image or the input
filename can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user
running the application. </p>

<p>This update removes the possibility of using pipe (|) in filenames to
interact with imagemagick.</p>

<p>It is important that you upgrade the libmagickcore-6.q16-2 and not just
the imagemagick package. Applications using libmagickcore-6.q16-2 might
also be affected and need to be restarted after the upgrade.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.8.9.9-5+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
