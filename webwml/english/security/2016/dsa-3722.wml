<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Larysch and Bram Moolenaar discovered that vim, an enhanced vi
editor, does not properly validate values for the the <q>filetype</q>,
<q>syntax</q> and <q>keymap</q> options, which may result in the execution of
arbitrary code if a file with a specially crafted modeline is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:7.4.488-7+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.</p>
