<p>It was discovered that fuseiso, a user-space implementation of the
ISO 9660 file system based on FUSE, contains several vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8836">CVE-2015-8836</a>

    <p>A stack-based buffer overflow may allow attackers who can trick a
    user into mounting a crafted ISO 9660 file system to cause a
    denial of service (crash), or, potentially, execute arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8837">CVE-2015-8837</a>

    <p>An integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow, which
    allows an attacker (who can trick a user into mounting a crafted
    ISO 9660 file system) to cause a denial of service (crash), or,
    potentially, execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 20070708-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (jessie) does not contain fuseiso packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 20070708-3.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fuseiso packages.</p>
