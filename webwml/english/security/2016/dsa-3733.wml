<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that APT, the high level
package manager, does not properly handle errors when validating
signatures on InRelease files. An attacker able to man-in-the-middle
HTTP requests to an apt repository that uses InRelease files
(clearsigned Release files), can take advantage of this flaw to
circumvent the signature of the InRelease file, leading to arbitrary
code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.9.8.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4~beta2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.</p>
