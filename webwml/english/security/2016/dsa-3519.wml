<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in the Xen virtualisation
solution, which may result in denial of service or information disclosure.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) will be updated in a separate DSA.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
