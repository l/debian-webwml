<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gustavo Grieco discovered several flaws in the way librsvg, a SAX-based
renderer library for SVG files, parses SVG files with circular
definitions. A remote attacker can take advantage of these flaws to
cause an application using the librsvg library to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.40.5-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.40.12-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.40.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your librsvg packages.</p>
