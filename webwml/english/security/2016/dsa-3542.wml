<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mercurial, a distributed
version control system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3068">CVE-2016-3068</a>

    <p>Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows URLs for Git
    subrepositories that could result in arbitrary code execution on
    clone.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3069">CVE-2016-3069</a>

    <p>Blake Burkhart discovered that Mercurial allows arbitrary code
    execution when converting Git repositories with specially
    crafted names.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-3630">CVE-2016-3630</a>

    <p>It was discovered that Mercurial does not properly perform bounds-checking
    in its binary delta decoder, which may be exploitable for
    remote code execution via clone, push or pull.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.2-4+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mercurial packages.</p>
