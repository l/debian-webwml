<p>Alexander Sulfrian discovered a buffer overflow in the
yy_get_next_buffer() function generated by Flex, which may result in
denial of service and potentially the execution of code if operating on
data from untrusted sources.</p>

<p>Affected applications need to be rebuild. bogofilter will be rebuild
against the updated flex in a followup update. Further affected
applications should be reported at the bug referenced above.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.39-8+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flex packages.</p>
