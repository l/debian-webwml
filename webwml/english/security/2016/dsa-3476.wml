<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.4, a SQL
database system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0766">CVE-2016-0766</a>

    <p>A privilege escalation vulnerability for users of PL/Java was
    discovered. Certain custom configuration settings (GUCs) for PL/Java
    will now be modifiable only by the database superuser to mitigate
    this issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0773">CVE-2016-0773</a>

    <p>Tom Lane and Greg Stark discovered a flaw in the way PostgreSQL
    processes specially crafted regular expressions. Very large
    character ranges in bracket expressions could cause infinite
    loops or memory overwrites. A remote attacker can exploit this
    flaw to cause a denial of service or, potentially, to execute
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.4.6-0+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.4 packages.</p>
