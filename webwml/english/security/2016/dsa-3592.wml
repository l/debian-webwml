<p>It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference in the Nginx code 
responsible for saving client request bodies to a temporary file might
result in denial of service: Malformed requests could crash worker
processes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-5+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
