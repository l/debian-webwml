<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7092">CVE-2016-7092</a> (XSA-185)

    <p>Jeremie Boutoille of Quarkslab and Shangcong Luan of Alibaba
    discovered a flaw in the handling of L3 pagetable entries, allowing
    a malicious 32-bit PV guest administrator can escalate their
    privilege to that of the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7094">CVE-2016-7094</a> (XSA-187)

    <p>x86 HVM guests running with shadow paging use a subset of the x86
    emulator to handle the guest writing to its own pagetables. Andrew
    Cooper of Citrix discovered that there are situations a guest can
    provoke which result in exceeding the space allocated for internal
    state. A malicious HVM guest administrator can cause Xen to fail a
    bug check, causing a denial of service to the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7154">CVE-2016-7154</a> (XSA-188)

    <p>Mikhail Gorobets of Advanced Threat Research, Intel Security
    discovered a use after free flaw in the FIFO event channel code. A
    malicious guest administrator can crash the host, leading to a
    denial of service. Arbitrary code execution (and therefore privilege
    escalation), and information leaks, cannot be excluded.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
