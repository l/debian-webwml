<p>It was discovered that the swift3 (S3 compatibility) middleware plugin
for Swift performed insufficient validation of date headers which might
result in replay attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.9-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your swift-plugin-s3 packages.</p>
