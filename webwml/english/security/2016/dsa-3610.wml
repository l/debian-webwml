<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Brandon Perry discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library
for C++, fails to successfully parse a DTD that is deeply nested,
causing a stack overflow. A remote unauthenticated attacker can take
advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service against applications
using the xerces-c library.</p>

<p>Additionally this update includes an enhancement to enable applications
to fully disable DTD processing through the use of an environment
variable (XERCES_DISABLE_DTD).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-5.1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.</p>
