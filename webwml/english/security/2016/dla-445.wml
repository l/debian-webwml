<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The backported patch to solve <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2569">CVE-2016-2569</a> yielded to failed assertions
that made squid3 to crash when closing connections. The fix for this CVE
strongly relies on exception handling present in more recent versions of
squid3, that I failed to identify in the previous update. I have
reverted the patch to take the safest position, taking into account that
Squeeze users should migrate to a supported version of Debian. This
post-EOL update is intended to keep a functional squid3 package in the
archive.</p>
