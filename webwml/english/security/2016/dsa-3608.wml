<p>Aleksandar Nikolic discovered that missing input sanitising in the RTF
parser in Libreoffice may result in the execution of arbitrary code if
a malformed documented is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:5.1.4~rc1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.1.4~rc1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>
