<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. A remote attacker can
take advantage of these flaws to cause a denial-of-service against an
application using the libgd2 library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.1-1 or earlier.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
