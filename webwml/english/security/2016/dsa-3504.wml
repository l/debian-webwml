<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alvaro Mu√±oz and Christian Schneider discovered that BeanShell, an
embeddable Java source interpreter, could be leveraged to execute
arbitrary commands: applications including BeanShell in their
classpath are vulnerable to this flaw if they deserialize data from an
untrusted source.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0b4-12+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0b4-15+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0b4-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bsh packages.</p>
