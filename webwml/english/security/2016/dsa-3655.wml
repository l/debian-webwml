<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in MuPDF, a lightweight PDF viewer.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6265">CVE-2016-6265</a>

    <p>Marco Grassi discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in MuPDF. An
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause an application
    crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to execute arbitrary code
    with the privileges of the user running MuPDF, if a specially
    crafted PDF file is processed.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6525">CVE-2016-6525</a>

    <p>Yu Hong and Zheng Jihong discovered a heap overflow vulnerability
    within the pdf_load_mesh_params function, allowing an attacker to
    cause an application crash (denial-of-service), or potentially to
    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
    MuPDF, if a specially crafted PDF file is processed.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mupdf packages.</p>
