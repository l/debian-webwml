<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a full virtualization
solution on x86 hardware.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7295">CVE-2015-7295</a>

    <p>Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc. discovered that the Virtual Network
    Device support is vulnerable to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion), that could occur when receiving large packets.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7504">CVE-2015-7504</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a heap-based buffer overflow that could result in
    denial-of-service (via application crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7512">CVE-2015-7512</a>

    <p>Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. and Jason Wang of Red Hat Inc.
    discovered that the PC-Net II ethernet controller is vulnerable to
    a buffer overflow that could result in denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8345">CVE-2015-8345</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the eepro100
    emulator contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite loop when
    processing Command Blocks, eventually resulting in
    denial-of-service (via application crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8504">CVE-2015-8504</a>

    <p>Lian Yihan of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the VNC display
    driver support is vulnerable to an arithmetic exception flaw that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8558">CVE-2015-8558</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the USB EHCI
    emulation support contains a flaw that could lead to an infinite
    loop during communication between the host controller and a device
    driver. This could lead to denial-of-service (via resource
    exhaustion).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8743">CVE-2015-8743</a>

    <p>Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the NE2000 emulator is
    vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write access issue, potentially
    resulting in information leak or memory corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1568">CVE-2016-1568</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that the IDE AHCI
    emulation support is vulnerable to a use-after-free issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash) or
    arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1714">CVE-2016-1714</a>

    <p>Donghai Zhu of Alibaba discovered that the Firmware Configuration
    emulation support is vulnerable to an out-of-bound read/write
    access issue, that could lead to denial-of-service (via
    application crash) or arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-1922">CVE-2016-1922</a>

    <p>Ling Liu of Qihoo 360 Inc. discovered that 32-bit Windows guests
    support is vulnerable to a null pointer dereference issue, that
    could lead to denial-of-service (via application crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.</p>
