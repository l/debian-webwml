<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or information disclosure if a specially crafted Postscript file is
processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.</p>
