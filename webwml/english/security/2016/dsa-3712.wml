<p>Nicolas Braud-Santoni discovered that incorrect sanitising of character
escape sequences in the Terminology terminal emulator may result in the
execution of arbitrary commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.0-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your terminology packages.</p>
