<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered in ImageMagick, a popular set of
programs and libraries for image manipulation. These issues include
several problems in memory handling that can result in a denial of
service attack or in execution of arbitrary code by an attacker with
control on the image input.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.9.6.5+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
