<p>It was discovered that libmatroska, an extensible open standard
audio/video container format, incorrectly processed EBML lacing. By
providing maliciously crafted input, an attacker could use this flaw
to force some leakage of information located in the process heap
memory.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.0-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmatroska packages.</p>
