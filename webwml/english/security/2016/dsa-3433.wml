<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223">CVE-2015-3223</a>

    <p>Thilo Uttendorfer of Linux Information Systems AG discovered that a
    malicious request can cause the Samba LDAP server to hang, spinning
    using CPU. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    mount a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252">CVE-2015-5252</a>

    <p>Jan <q>Yenya</q> Kasprzak and the Computer Systems Unit team at Faculty
    of Informatics, Masaryk University discovered that insufficient
    symlink verification could allow data access outside an exported
    share path.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5296">CVE-2015-5296</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher of SerNet discovered that Samba does not ensure
    that signing is negotiated when creating an encrypted client
    connection to a server. This allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to
    downgrade the connection and connect using the supplied credentials
    as an unsigned, unencrypted connection.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5299">CVE-2015-5299</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a missing access control check in the VFS
    shadow_copy2 module could allow unauthorized users to access
    snapshots.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330">CVE-2015-5330</a>

    <p>Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst discovered that the Samba LDAP server
    is vulnerable to a remote memory read attack. A remote attacker can
    obtain sensitive information from daemon heap memory by sending
    crafted packets and then either read an error message, or a
    database value.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7540">CVE-2015-7540</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a malicious client can send packets that
    cause the LDAP server provided by the AD DC in the samba daemon
    process to consume unlimited memory and be terminated.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8467">CVE-2015-8467</a>

    <p>Andrew Bartlett of the Samba Team and Catalyst discovered that a
    Samba server deployed as an AD DC can expose Windows DCs in the same
    domain to a denial of service via the creation of multiple machine
    accounts. This issue is related to the MS15-096 / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2535">CVE-2015-2535</a>
    security issue in Windows.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u6. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252">CVE-2015-5252</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5296">CVE-2015-5296</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5299">CVE-2015-5299</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.17+dfsg-2+deb8u1. The fixes for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223">CVE-2015-3223</a> and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330">CVE-2015-5330</a> required an update to ldb 2:1.1.17-2+deb8u1 to correct the
defects.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.22+dfsg-1. The fixes for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3223">CVE-2015-3223</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5330">CVE-2015-5330</a>
required an update to ldb 2:1.1.24-1 to correct the defects.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
