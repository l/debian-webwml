<p>A use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG Animation was discovered in
the Mozilla Firefox web browser, allowing a remote attacker to cause a
denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code, if a
user is tricked into opening a specially crafted website.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 45.5.1esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.</p>
