<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of
the Java sandbox, information disclosur, denial of service and insecure
cryptography.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b38-1.13.10-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
