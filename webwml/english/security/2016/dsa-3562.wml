<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in tardiff, a tarball comparison
tool. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0857">CVE-2015-0857</a>

    <p>Rainer Mueller and Florian Weimer discovered that tardiff is prone
    to shell command injections via shell meta-characters in filenames
    in tar files or via shell meta-characters in the tar filename
    itself.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0858">CVE-2015-0858</a>

    <p>Florian Weimer discovered that tardiff uses predictable temporary
    directories for unpacking tarballs. A malicious user can use this
    flaw to overwrite files with permissions of the user running the
    tardiff command line tool.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.1-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.1-5 and partially in earlier versions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tardiff packages.</p>
