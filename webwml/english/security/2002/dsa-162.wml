<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ethereal developers discovered a buffer overflow in the ISIS protocol
dissector.  It may be possible to make Ethereal crash or hang by
injecting a purposefully malformed packet onto the wire, or by
convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.  It may be
possible to make Ethereal run arbitrary code by exploiting the buffer
and pointer problems.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.9.4-1woody2 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 0.8.0-4potato.1 for
the old stable distribution (potato) and in version 0.9.6-1 for the
unstable distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
