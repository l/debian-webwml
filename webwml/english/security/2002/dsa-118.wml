<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tim Waugh found several insecure uses of temporary files in the xsane
program, which is used for scanning.  This was fixed for Debian/stable
by moving those files into a securely created directory within the
/tmp directory.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.50-5.1 for the stable Debian
distribution and in version 0.84-0.1 for the testing and unstable
distribution of Debian.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xsane package.</p>
