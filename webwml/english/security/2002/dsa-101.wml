<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Krahmer from SuSE found a vulnerability in sudo which could
easily lead into a local root exploit.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in upstream version 1.6.4 as well as in
version 1.6.2p2-2.1 for the stable release of Debian GNU/Linux.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages immediately.</p>
