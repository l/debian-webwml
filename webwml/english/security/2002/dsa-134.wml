<define-tag description>remote exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>ISS X-Force released an advisory about an OpenSSH "Remote Challenge
Vulnerability". Unfortunately, the advisory was incorrect on some
points, leading to widespread confusion about the impact of this
vulnerability. No version of OpenSSH in Debian is affected by the
SKEY and BSD_AUTH authentication methods described in the ISS
advisory. However, Debian does include OpenSSH servers with the PAM
feature described as vulnerable in the later advisory by the OpenSSH
team. (This vulnerable feature is authentication using PAM via the
keyboard-interactive mechanism [kbdint].) This vulnerability affects
OpenSSH versions 2.3.1 through 3.3. No exploit is currently known for
the PAM/kbdint vulnerability, but the details are publicly known. All
of these vulnerabilities were corrected in OpenSSH 3.4.</p>

<p>In addition to the vulnerabilities fixes outlined above, our OpenSSH
packages version 3.3 and higher support the new privilege separation
feature from Niels Provos, which changes ssh to use a separate
non-privileged process to handle most of the work. Vulnerabilities in
the unprivileged parts of OpenSSH will lead to compromise of an
unprivileged account restricted to an empty chroot, rather than a
direct root compromise. Privilege separation should help to mitigate
the risks of any future OpenSSH compromise.</p>

<p>Debian 2.2 (potato) shipped with an ssh package based on OpenSSH
1.2.3, and is not vulnerable to the vulnerabilities covered by this
advisory. Users still running a version 1.2.3 ssh package do not have
an immediate need to upgrade to OpenSSH 3.4. Users who upgraded to the
OpenSSH version 3.3 packages released in previous iterations of
DSA-134 should upgrade to the new version 3.4 OpenSSH packages, as the
version 3.3 packages are vulnerable. We suggest that users running
OpenSSH 1.2.3 consider a move to OpenSSH 3.4 to take advantage of the
privilege separation feature. (Though, again, we have no specific
knowledge of any vulnerability in OpenSSH 1.2.3. Please carefully read
the caveats listed below before upgrading from OpenSSH 1.2.3.) We
recommend that any users running a back-ported version of OpenSSH
version 2.0 or higher on potato move to OpenSSH 3.4.</p>

<p>The current pre-release version of Debian (woody) includes an OpenSSH
version 3.0.2p1 package (ssh), which is vulnerable to the PAM/kbdint
problem described above. We recommend that users upgrade to OpenSSH
3.4 and enable privilege separation. Please carefully read the release
notes below before upgrading. Updated packages for ssh-krb5 (an
OpenSSH package supporting kerberos authentication) are currently
being developed. Users who cannot currently upgrade their OpenSSH
packages may work around the known vulnerabilities by disabling the
vulnerable features: make sure the following lines are uncommented and
present in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and restart ssh</p>

<pre>
  PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt no
  ChallengeResponseAuthentication no
</pre>

<p>There should be no other PAMAuthenticationViaKbdInt or
ChallengeResponseAuthentication entries in sshd_config.</p>

<p>That concludes the vulnerability section of this advisory. What
follows are release notes related to the OpenSSH 3.4 package and the
privilege separation feature. URLs for the OpenSSH 3.4 packages are at
the bottom.</p>

<p>Some notes on possible issues associated with this upgrade:</p>

<ul>
<li>This package introduces a new account called `sshd' that is used in
    the privilege separation code. If no sshd account exists the package
    will try to create one. If the account already exists it will be
    re-used. If you do not want this to happen you will have to fix this
    manually.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update adds a back-port of version
    0.9.6c of the SSL library. This means you will have to upgrade the
    libssl0.9.6 package as well.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update uses version 2 of the SSH
    protocol by default (even if configured to support version 1 of the
    SSH protocol). This can break existing setups where RSA
    authentication is used. You will either have to
    <ul>
      <li>add -1 to the ssh invocation to keep using SSH protocol 1 and
          your existing keys, or 
      <li>change the <kbd>Protocol</kbd> line in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt>
          and/or
          <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> to "<kbd>Protocol 1,2</kbd>"
          to try protocol 1
          before protocol 2, or
      <li>create new rsa or dsa keys for SSH protocol 2
    </ul>
    </li>

<li>sshd defaults to enabling privilege separation, even if you do not
    explicitly enable it in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>.</li>

<li>ssh fall-back to rsh is no longer available.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) Privilege separation does not currently
    work with Linux 2.0 kernels.</li>

<li>Privilege separation does not currently work with PAM authentication
    via the KeyboardInteractive mechanism.</li>

<li>Privilege separation causes some PAM modules which expect to run
    with root privileges to fail.</li>

<li>If for some reason you cannot use privilege separation at this time due
    to one of the issues described above, you can disable it by adding
    "<kbd>UsePrivilegeSeparation no</kbd>" to your
    <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> file.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some issues from previous OpenSSH 3.3p1 packages corrected in this
advisory (not a complete changelog):</p>

<ul>
<li>(relevant for potato only) the installation question, "do you want
    to allow protocol 2 only" no longer defaults to "yes" for potato
    packages. Users who
    answered yes to this question and also chose to regenerate their
    sshd_config file found that they could no longer connect to their
    server via protocol 1. See <tt>/usr/doc/ssh/README.Debian</tt> for
    instructions on how to enable protocol 1 if caught in this situation.
    Since the default in the potato packages is now "no", this should not be
    an issue for people upgrading from version 1.2.3 in the future.
    </li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) the ssh package no longer conflicts with
    rsh-server, nor does it provide an rsh alternative</li>

<li>installation will no longer fail if users choose to generate
    protocol 1 keys</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, we regret having to release packages with larger changes and
less testing than is our usual practice; given the potential severity
and non-specific nature of the original threat we decided that our users were
best served by having packages available for evaluation as quickly as
possible. We will send additional information as it comes to us, and
will continue to work on the outstanding issues.</p>
