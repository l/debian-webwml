<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Theo de Raadt announced that the OpenBSD team is working with ISS
on a remote exploit for OpenSSH (a free implementation of the
Secure SHell protocol). They are refusing to provide any details on
the vulnerability but instead are advising everyone to upgrade to
the latest release, version 3.3.</p>

<p>This version was released 3 days ago and introduced a new feature
to reduce the effect of exploits in the network handling code
called privilege separation.  Unfortunately this release has a few
known problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>compression does not work on all operating systems since the code
    relies on specific mmap features,</li>

<li>the PAM support has not been completed and may break a few PAM
    modules,</li>

<li>keyboard interactive authentication does not work with privilege
    seperation. Most noticable for Debian users this breaks PAM modules
    which need a PAM conversation function (like the OPIE module).</li>
</ul>

<p>The new privilege separation support from Niels Provos changes ssh
to use a separate non-privileged process to handle most of the
work. This means any vulnerability in this part of OpenSSH can
never lead to a root compromise but only to access to a separate
account restricted to a chroot.</p>

<p>Theo made it very clear this new version does not fix the
vulnerability, instead by using the new privilege separation code
it merely reduces the risk since the attacker can only gain access
to a special account restricted in a chroot.</p>

<p>Since details of the problem have not been released we were forced
to move to the latest release of OpenSSH portable, version 3.3p1.</p>

<p>Please note that we have not had the time to do proper QA on these
packages; they might contain bugs or break things unexpectedly. If you
notice any such problems (besides the ones mentioned in this advisory)
please file a bug-report so we can investigate.</p>

<p>Some notes on possible issues associated with this upgrade:</p>

<ul>
<li>This package introduce a new account called `sshd' that is used in
    the privilege separation code. If no sshd account exists the package
    will try to create one. If the account already exists it will be
    re-used. If you do not want this to happen you will have to fix this
    manually.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update adds a backport of version
    0.9.6 of the SSL library. This means you will have to upgrade the
    ssl package as well.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update defaults to using version 2
    of the SSH protocol. This can break existing setups where RSA
    authentication is used. You will either have to add -1 to the ssh
    invocation to keep using SSH protocol 1 and your existing keys, or
    create new keys for SSH protocol 2.</li>

<li>sshd defaults to enabling privilege seperation, even if you do not
    explicitly enable it in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>.</li>

<li>If ssh does not work for you you can try to disable compression. We
    already included a patch from Solar Designer which fixes the problem
    with Linux 2.2 kernels, but there might be a few cases where this is
    not sufficient.</li>
</ul>

<p>Please note that packages for the m68k architecture for woody are not
available yet.</p>
