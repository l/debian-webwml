<define-tag description>remote exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Theo de Raadt announced that the OpenBSD team is working with ISS
to adress a remote exploit for OpenSSH (a free implementation of the
Secure SHell protocol). They are refusing to provide any details on
the vulnerability but instead are advising users to upgrade to
the latest release, version 3.3.</p>

<p>This version was released on June 22, 2002 and it enabled by default
a feature called privilege separation, in order to minimize the effect
of exploits in the ssh network handling code. Unfortunately this release
has a few known problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>compression does not work on all operating systems since the code
    relies on specific mmap features,</li>

<li>the PAM support has not been completed and may break a few PAM
    modules,</li>

<li>keyboard interactive authentication does not work with privilege
    seperation. Most noticable for Debian users this breaks PAM modules
    which need a PAM conversation function (like the OPIE module).</li>
</ul>

<p>The new privilege separation support from Niels Provos changes ssh
to use a separate non-privileged process to handle most of the
work. This means that any vulnerability in this part of OpenSSH can
never lead to a root compromise but only to compromise of an unprivileged
account restricted to a chroot.</p>

<p>Theo made it very clear this new version does not fix the
vulnerability. Instead, using the new privilege separation code
it mitigates the vulnerability since the attacker can only gain access
to that unprivileged account restricted in a chroot.</p>

<p>Since details of the problem have not been released, the move to the
latest release of OpenSSH portable, version 3.3p1, is the only known
method of mitigating the risk of the reported vulnerability.</p>

<p>Please note that we have not had the time to do proper QA on these
packages; they might contain bugs or break things unexpectedly. If you
notice any such problems (besides the ones mentioned in this advisory)
please file a bug-report so we can investigate.</p>

<p>Some notes on possible issues associated with this upgrade:</p>

<ul>
<li>This package introduces a new account called `sshd' that is used in
    the privilege separation code. If no sshd account exists the package
    will try to create one. If the account already exists it will be
    re-used. If you do not want this to happen you will have to fix this
    manually.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update adds a backport of version
    0.9.6c of the SSL library. This means you will have to upgrade the
    ssl package as well.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) This update defaults to using version 2
    of the SSH protocol. This can break existing setups where RSA
    authentication is used. You will either have to
    <ul>
      <li>add -1 to the ssh invocation to keep using SSH protocol 1 and
          your existing keys, or 
      <li>change the Protocol line in <tt>/etc/ssh/ssh_config</tt> and/or
          <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt> to "Protocol 1,2" to try protocol 1
          before protocol 2, or
      <li>create new rsa or dsa keys for SSH protocol 2
    </ul>
    </li>

<li>sshd defaults to enabling privilege seperation, even if you do not
    explicitly enable it in <tt>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</tt>. Again, unless you
    have "UsePrivilegeSeparation no" in your sshd_config, you will be using
    privilege seperation with this package.</li>

<li>If ssh does not work for you you can try to disable compression. We
    included a patch from Solar Designer which should fix the problem
    with Linux 2.2 kernels, but there might be a few cases where this is
    not sufficient.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) Privilege seperation does not currently
    work with Linux 2.0 kernels</li>

<li>If for some reason you cannot use privilege seperation (e.g.,
    because you are running a 2.0 kernel) but have already installed the
    openssh 3.3p1 package, you can revert to previous behavior by adding
    "UsePrivilegeSeparation no" to your /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
    <strong>Note that disabling privilege seperation will leave you
    vulnerable to the security problem described in this advisory and
    should only be done on an emergency basis.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Some issues from previous openssh 3.3p1 packages corrected in this
advisory (not a complete changelog):</p>

<ul>
<li>(relevant for potato only) the installation question, "[do you want
    to allow protocol 2 only" no longer defaults to "yes". Users who
    answered yes to this question and also chose to regenerate their
    sshd_config file found that they could no longer connect to their
    server via protocol 1. See <tt>/usr/doc/ssh/README.Debian</tt> for
    instructions on how to enable protocol 1 if caught in this situation.</li>

<li>(relevant for potato only) the ssh package no longer conflicts with
    rsh-server, nor does it provide an rsh alternative</li>

<li>installation will no longer fail if users choose to generate
    protocol 1 keys</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, we regret having to release packages with larger changes and
less testing than is our usual practice; given the potential severity
and non-specific nature of the threat we decided that our users were
best served by having packages available for evaluation as quickly as
possible. We will send additional information as it comes to us, and
will continue to work on the outstanding issues.</p>

<p>Please note that packages for the m68k architecture for woody are not
available yet.</p>
