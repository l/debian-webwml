<define-tag description>improper variable initialization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kim Nielsen recently found an internal problem with the CVS server and
reported it to the vuln-dev mailing list.  The problem is triggered by
an improperly initialized global variable.  A user exploiting this can
crash the CVS server, which may be accessed through the pserver
service and running under a remote user id.  It is not yet clear if
the remote account can be exposed, though.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.10.7-9 for the stable Debian
distribution with help of Niels Heinen and in versions newer
than 1.11.1p1debian-3 for the
testing and unstable distribution of Debian (not yet uploaded,
though).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your CVS package.</p>
