<p>Bindview discovered a problem in several IPSEC implementations that do
not properly handle certain very short packets.  IPSEC is a set of
security extensions to IP which provide authentication and encryption.
Free/SWan in Debain is affected by this and is said to cause a kernel
panic.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.96-1.4 for the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 1.99-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) does not
contain Free/SWan packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeswan package.</p>
