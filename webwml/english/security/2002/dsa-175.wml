<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Balazs Scheidler <a href="http://www.balabit.hu/static/zsa/ZSA-2002-014-en.txt">\
discovered</a> a problem in the way syslog-ng handles macro
expansion.  When a macro is expanded a static length buffer is used
accompanied by a counter.  However, when constant characters are
appended, the counter is not updated properly, leading to incorrect
boundary checking.  An attacker may be able to use specially crafted
log messages inserted via UDP which overflows the buffer.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.5.15-1.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 1.4.0rc3-3.2 for the old
stable distribution (potato) and version 1.5.21-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your syslog-ng package immediately.</p>
