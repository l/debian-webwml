<define-tag description>arbitrary code execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem in cacti, a PHP based frontend to rrdtool for monitoring
systems and services, has been discovered.  This could lead into cacti
executing arbitrary program code under the user id of the web server.
This problem, however, is only persistant to users who already have
administrator privileges in the cacti system.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed by removing any dollar signs and backticks
from the title string in version 0.6.7-2.1 for the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 0.6.8a-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since it doesn't contain the cacti package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package immediately.</p>
