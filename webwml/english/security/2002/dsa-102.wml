<define-tag description>daemon exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>zen-parse found a bug in the current implementation of at which leads
into a heap corruption vulnerability which in turn could potentially
lead into an exploit of the daemon user.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your at packages.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the bugfix from DSA 102-1 wasn't propagated properly due
to a packaging bug.  While the file parsetime.y was fixed, and yy.tab.c
should be generated from it, yy.tab.c from the original source was still
used.  This has been fixed in DSA-102-2.</p>
