<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Olaf Kirch from SuSE Linux AG discovered another vulnerability in the
klisa package, that provides a LAN information service similar to
"Network Neighbourhood".  The lisa daemon contains a buffer overflow
vulnerability which potentially enables any local user, as well any
any remote attacker on the LAN who is able to gain control of the LISa
port (7741 by default), to obtain root privileges.  In addition, a
remote attacker potentially may be able to gain access to a victim's
account by using an "rlan://" URL in an HTML page or via another KDE
application.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-14.5 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-14.20 for the
unstable distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is
not affected since it doesn't contain a kdenetwork package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your klisa package immediately.</p>
