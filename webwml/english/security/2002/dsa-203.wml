<define-tag description>arbitrary command execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Robert Luberda found a security problem in smb2www, a Windows Network
client that is accessible through a web browser.  This could lead a
remote attacker to execute arbitrary programs under the user id
www-data on the host where smb2www is running.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 980804-16.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 980804-8.1 of the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 980804-17 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smb2www package immediately.</p>
