<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tom Yu and Sam Hartman of MIT discovered another stack buffer overflow
in the kadm_ser_wrap_in function in the Kerberos v4 administration
server.  This kadmind bug has a working exploit code circulating,
hence it is considered serious.  The MIT krb5 implementation
includes support for version 4, including a complete v4 library,
server side support for krb4, and limited client support for v4.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.4-5woody3 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.6-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since no krb5 packages are included.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages immediately.</p>
