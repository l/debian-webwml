<p>The SuSE Security Team found a vulnerability in html2ps, a HTML to
PostScript converter, that opened files based on unsanitized input
insecurely.  This problem can be exploited when html2ps is installed
as filter within lrpng and the attacker has previously gained access
to the lp account.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 1.0b3-1.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 1.0b1-8.1 for the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 1.0b3-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your html2ps package.</p>
