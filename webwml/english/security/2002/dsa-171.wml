<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser <a href="http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/032002.html">\
discovered</a> several buffer overflows and a broken boundary
check within fetchmail.  If fetchmail is running in multidrop mode
these flaws can be used by remote attackers to crash it or to execute
arbitrary code under the user id of the user running fetchmail.
Depending on the configuration this even allows a remote root
compromise.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 5.9.11-6.1 for both
fetchmail and fetchmail-ssl for the current stable distribution
(woody), in version 5.3.3-4.2 for fetchmail for the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 6.1.0-1 for both fetchmail and
fetchmail-ssl for the unstable distribution (sid).  There are no
fetchmail-ssl packages for the old stable distribution (potato) and
thus no updates.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail packages immediately.</p>
