<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that tkmail creates temporary files insecurely.
Exploiting this an attacker with local access can easily create and
overwrite files as another user.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 4.0beta9-8.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 4.0beta9-4.1 for the old
stable distribution (potato) and in version 4.0beta9-9 for the
unstable distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tkmail packages.</p>
