<p>Joao Gouveia discovered an uninitialized variable which was insecurely
used with file inclusions in the mantis package, a php based bug
tracking system.  The Debian Security Team found even more similar
problems.  When these occasions are exploited, a remote user is able
to execute arbitrary code under the webserver user id on the web
server hosting the mantis system.</p>

<p>Jeroen Latour discovered that Mantis did not check all user input,
especially if they do not come directly from form fields. This opens
up a wide variety of SQL poisoning vulnerabilities on systems without
magic_quotes_gpc enabled.  Most of these vulnerabilities are only
exploitable in a limited manner, since it is no longer possible to
execute multiple queries using one call to mysql_query().  There is
one query which can be tricked into changing an account's access
level.</p>

<p>Jeroen Latour also reported that it is possible to instruct Mantis to
show reporters only the bugs that they reported, by setting the
limit_reporters option to ON.  However, when formatting the output
suitable for printing, the program did not check the limit_reporters
option and thus allowed reporters to see the summaries of bugs they
did not report.</p>

<p>Jeroen Latour discovered that the page responsible for displaying a
list of bugs in a particular project, did not check whether the user
actually has access to the project, which is transmitted by a cookie
variable.  It accidentally trusted the fact that only projects
accessible to the user were listed in the drop-down menu.  This
provides a malicious user with an opportunity to display the bugs of a
private project selected.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 0.17.1-2.2 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.17.4a-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected, since it doesn't contain the mantis package.</p>
