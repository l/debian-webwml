<p>Joao Gouveia discovered an uninitialized variable which was insecurely
used with file inclusions in the mantis package, a php based bug
tracking system.  The Debian Security Team found even more similar
problems.  When these occasions are exploited, a remote user is able
to execute arbitrary code under the webserver user id on the web
server hosting the mantis system.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 0.17.1-2.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.17.3-3 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected, since it doesn't contain the mantis package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis packages immediately.</p>
