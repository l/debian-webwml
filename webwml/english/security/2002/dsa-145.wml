<define-tag description>doubly freed memory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The authors of tinyproxy, a lightweight HTTP proxy, discovered a bug
in the handling of some invalid proxy requests.  Under some
circumstances, an invalid request may result in a allocated memory
being freed twice.  This can potentially result in the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.4.3-2woody2 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 1.4.3-3 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tinyproxy package immediately.</p>
