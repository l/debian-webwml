<p>According to David Wagner, iDEFENSE and the Apache HTTP Server
Project, several remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been found
in the Apache package, a commonly used webserver.  These
vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to enact a denial of service
against a server or execute a cross scripting attack.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project identified the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ol>

<li>1. CAN-2002-0839: A vulnerability exists on platforms using System V
   shared memory based scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an
   attacker who can execute under the Apache UID to exploit the Apache
   shared memory scoreboard format and send a signal to any process as
   root or cause a local denial of service attack.</li>

<li>2. CAN-2002-0840: Apache is susceptible to a cross site scripting
   vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted on a
   domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.</li>

<li>3. CAN-2002-0843: There were some possible overflows in the utility
   ApacheBench (ab) which could be exploited by a malicious server.</li>

<li>4. CAN-2002-1233: A race condition in the htpasswd and htdigest
   program enables a malicious local user to read or even modify the
   contents of a password file or easily create and overwrite files as
   the user running the htpasswd (or htdigest respectively) program.</li>

<li>5. CAN-2001-0131: htpasswd and htdigest in Apache 2.0a9, 1.3.14, and
   others allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a
   symlink attack.

<p>   This is the same vulnerability as CAN-2002-1233, which was fixed in
   potato already but got lost later and was never applied upstream.</p></li>

<li>5. NO-CAN: Several buffer overflows have been found in the ApacheBench
   (ab) utility that could be exploited by a remote server returning
   very long strings.</li>
</ol>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 1.3.26-0woody3 for the
current stable distribution (woody) and in 1.3.9-14.3 for the old
stable distribution (potato).  Corrected packages for the unstable
distribution (sid) are expected soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Apache package immediately.</p>
