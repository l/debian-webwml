<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>According to David Wagner, iDEFENSE and the Apache HTTP Server
Project, several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache server
package, a commonly used webserver.  Most of the code is shared
between the Apache and Apache-Perl packages, so vulnerabilities are
shared as well.</p>

<p>These vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to enact a denial of
service against a server or execute a cross site scripting attack, or
steal cookies from other web site users.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures (CVE) project identified the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>CAN-2002-0839: A vulnerability exists on platforms using System V
   shared memory based scoreboards.  This vulnerability allows an
   attacker to execute code under the Apache UID to exploit the Apache
   shared memory scoreboard format and send a signal to any process as
   root or cause a local denial of service attack.</li>

<li>CAN-2002-0840: Apache is susceptible to a cross site scripting
   vulnerability in the default 404 page of any web server hosted on a
   domain that allows wildcard DNS lookups.</li>

<li>CAN-2002-0843: There were some possible overflows in the utility
   ApacheBench (ab) which could be exploited by a malicious server.
   No such binary programs are distributed by the Apache-Perl package,
   though.</li>

<li>CAN-2002-1233: A race condition in the htpasswd and htdigest
   program enables a malicious local user to read or even modify the
   contents of a password file or easily create and overwrite files as
   the user running the htpasswd (or htdigest respectively) program.
   No such binary programs are distributed by the Apache-Perl package,
   though.</li>

<li>CAN-2001-0131: htpasswd and htdigest in Apache 2.0a9, 1.3.14, and
   others allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a
   symlink attack.  No such binary programs are distributed by the
   Apache-Perl package, though.</li>

<li> NO-CAN: Several buffer overflows have been found in the ApacheBench
   (ab) utility that could be exploited by a remote server returning
   very long strings.  No such binary programs are distributed by the
   Apache-Perl package, though.</li>
</ol>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 1.3.26-1-1.26-0woody2 for
the current stable distribution (woody), in
1.3.9-14.1-1.21.20000309-1.1 for the old stable distribution (potato)
and in version 1.3.26-1.1-1.27-3-1 for the unstable distribution
(sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Apache-Perl package immediately.</p>
