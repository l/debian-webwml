<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The BGP decoding routines for tcpdump used incorrect bounds checking
when copying data. This could be abused by introducing malicious traffic
on a sniffed network for a denial of service attack against tcpdump,
or possibly even remote code execution.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 3.6.2-2.2.</p>
