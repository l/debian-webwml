<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow in gv, a PostScript and PDF
viewer for X11.  The same code is present in gnome-gv.  This problem
is triggered by scanning the PostScript file and can be exploited by
an attacker sending a malformed PostScript or PDF file.  The attacker
is able to cause arbitrary code to be run with the privileges of the
victim.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.1.96-3.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 0.82-2.1 for the old stable
distribution (potato) and version 1.99.7-9 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnome-gv package.</p>
