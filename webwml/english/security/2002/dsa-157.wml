<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The IRC client irssi is vulnerable to a denial of service condition.
The problem occurs when a user attempts to join a channel that has an
overly long topic description.  When a certain string is appended to
the topic, irssi will crash.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.8.4-3.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.8.5-2 for the
unstable distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is
not affected, since the corresponding portions of code are not
present.  The same applies to irssi-gnome and irssi-gtk, which don't
seem to be affected as well.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your irssi-text package.</p>
