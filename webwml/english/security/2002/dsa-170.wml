<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A security vulnerability has been found in all Tomcat 4.x releases.
This problem allows an attacker to use a specially crafted URL to
return the unprocessed source code of a JSP page, or, under special
circumstances, a static resource which would otherwise have been
protected by security constraints, without the need for being properly
authenticated.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 4.0.3-3woody1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 4.1.12-1 for the unstable
release (sid).  The old stable release (potato) does not contain
tomcat packages.  Also, packages for tomcat3 are not vulnerable to
this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat package immediately.</p>
