<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow in gv, a PostScript and PDF
viewer for X11.  This problem is triggered by scanning the PostScript
file and can be exploited by an attacker sending a malformed
PostScript or PDF file.  The attacker is able to cause arbitrary code
to be run with the privileges of the victim.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 3.5.8-26.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 3.5.8-17.1 for the old stable
distribution (potato) and version 3.5.8-27 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gv package.</p>
