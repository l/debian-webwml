<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mark Litchfield found a denial of service attack in the Apache
web-server. While investigating the problem the Apache Software
Foundation discovered that the code for handling invalid requests which
use chunked encoding also might allow arbitrary code execution on 64 bit
architectures.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.3.9.13-4.1 of the Debian apache-ssl
package and we recommend that you upgrade your apache-ssl package
immediately.</p>

<p>An update for the soon to be released Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody
distribution is not available at the moment.</p>
