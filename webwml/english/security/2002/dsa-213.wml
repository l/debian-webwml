<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Glenn Randers-Pehrson discovered a problem in connection with 16-bit
samples from libpng, an interface for reading and writing PNG
(Portable Network Graphics) format files.  The starting offsets for
the loops are calculated incorrectly which causes a buffer overrun
beyond the beginning of the row buffer.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.0.12-3.woody.3 for libpng and in version
1.2.1-1.1.woody.3 for libpng3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0.5-1.1 for libpng.  There are no other libpng packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.12-7 for libpng and in version 1.2.5-8 for libpng3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
