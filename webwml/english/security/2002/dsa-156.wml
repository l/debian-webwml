<define-tag description>arbitrary script execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>All versions of the EPIC script Light prior to 2.7.30p5 (on the 2.7
branch) and prior to 2.8pre10 (on the 2.8 branch) running on any
platform are vulnerable to a remotely-exploitable bug, which can lead
to nearly arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.7.30p5-1.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 2.7.30p5-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected, since it doesn't contain the Light package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your epic4-script-light package and
restart your IRC client.</p>
