<p>Larry McVoy found a bug in the packet handling code for the CIPE
VPN package: it did not check if a received packet was too short 
and could crash.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.3.0-3, and we recommend that you
upgrade your CIPE packages immediately.</p>

<p>Please note that the package only contains the required kernel patch,
you will have to manually build the kernel modules for your kernel with the
updated source from the <code>cipe-source</code> package.</p>
