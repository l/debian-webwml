<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Zen-parse discovered a buffer overflow in gv, a PostScript and PDF
viewer for X11.  The same code is present in kghostview which is part
of the KDE-Graphics package.  This problem is triggered by scanning
the PostScript file and can be exploited by an attacker sending a
malformed PostScript or PDF file.  The attacker is able to cause
arbitrary code to be run with the privileges of the victim.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-6.8 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-6.9 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since no KDE is included.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kghostview package.</p>
