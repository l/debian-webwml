<define-tag description>broken boundary check and more</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser, who is also a member of the PHP team, found several
<a href="http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012002.html">flaws</a>
in the way PHP handles multipart/form-data POST requests (as
described in RFC1867) known as POST fileuploads.  Each of the flaws
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's
system.</p>

<p>For PHP3 flaws contain a broken boundary check and an arbitrary heap
overflow.  For PHP4 they consist of a broken boundary check and a heap
off by one error.</p>

<p>For the stable release of Debian these problems are fixed in version
3.0.18-0potato1.1 of PHP3 and version 4.0.3pl1-0potato3 of PHP4.</p>

<p>For the unstable and testing release of Debian these problems are
fixed in version 3.0.18-22 of PHP3 and version 4.1.2-1 of PHP4.</p>

<p>There is no PHP4 in the stable and unstable distribution for the arm
architecture due to a compiler error.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages immediately.</p>
