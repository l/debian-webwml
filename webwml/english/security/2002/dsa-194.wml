<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A set of buffer overflows have been discovered in masqmail, a mail
transport agent for hosts without permanent internet connection.  In
addition to this privileges were dropped only after reading a user
supplied configuration file.  Together this could be exploited to gain
unauthorized root access to the machine on which masqmail is
installed.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 0.1.16-2.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.2.15-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since it doesn't contain a masqmail package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your masqmail package immediately.</p>
