<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>lynx (a text-only web browser) did not properly check for illegal
characters in all places, including processing of command line options,
which could be used to insert extra HTTP headers in a request.</p>

<p>For Debian GNU/Linux 2.2/potato this has been fixed in version 2.8.3-1.1
of the lynx package and version 2.8.3.1-1.1 of the lynx-ssl package.</p>

<p>For Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody this has been fixed in version 2.8.4.1b-3.2
of the lynx package and version 1:2.8.4.1b-3.1 of the lynx-ssl package.</p>
