<define-tag moreinfo>
Sebastian Krahmer found several places in rsync (a popular tool to
synchronise files between machines) where signed and unsigned numbers
were mixed which resulted in insecure code. This could be abused by
remote users to write 0-bytes in rsync's memory and trick rsync into
executing arbitrary code.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.3.2-1.3 and we recommend you upgrade
your rsync package immediately.
