<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Enrico Zini discovered a buffer overflow in log2mail, a daemon for
watching logfiles and sending lines with matching patterns via mail.
The log2mail daemon is started upon system boot and runs as root.  A
specially crafted (remote) log message could overflow a static buffer,
potentially leaving log2mail to execute arbitrary code as root.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.2.5.1 the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.2.6-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since it doesn't contain a log2mail package</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your log2mail package.</p>
