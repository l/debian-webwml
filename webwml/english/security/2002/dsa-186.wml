<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Enrico Zini discovered a buffer overflow in log2mail, a daemon for
watching logfiles and sending lines with matching patterns via mail.
The log2mail daemon is started upon system boot and runs as root.  A
specially crafted (remote) log message could overflow a static buffer,
potentially leaving log2mail to execute arbitrary code as root.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.2.5.1 the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version  for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since it doesn't contain a log2mail package</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your log2mail package.</p>
