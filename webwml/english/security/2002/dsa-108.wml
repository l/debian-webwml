<define-tag description>symlink vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nicolas Boullis found some security problems in the wmtv package (a
dockable video4linux TV player for windowmaker) which is distributed
in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.  With the current version of wmtv, the
configuration file is written back as the superuser, and without any
further checks.  A malicious user might use that to damage important
files.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.6.5-2potato2 for the stable
distribution by dropping privileges as soon as possible and only
regaining them where required.  In the current testing/unstable
distribution this problem has been fixed in version 0.6.5-9 and above
by not requiring privileges anymore.  Both contain fixes for two
potential buffer overflows as well.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wmtv packages immediately.</p>
