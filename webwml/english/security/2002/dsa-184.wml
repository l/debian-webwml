<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tom Yu and Sam Hartman of MIT discovered another stack buffer overflow
in the kadm_ser_wrap_in function in the Kerberos v4 administration
server.  This kadmind bug has a working exploit code circulating,
hence it is considered serious.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.1-8-2.2 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 1.0-2.2 for the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 1.1-11-8 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb4 packages immediately.</p>
