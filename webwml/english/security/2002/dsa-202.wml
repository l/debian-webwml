<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tatsuya Kinoshita discovered that IM, which contains interface
commands and Perl libraries for E-mail and NetNews, creates temporary
files insecurely.</p>

<ul>
<li> The impwagent program creates a temporary directory in an insecure
    manner in /tmp using predictable directory names without checking
    the return code of mkdir, so it's possible to seize a permission
    of the temporary directory by local access as another user.</li>

<li> The immknmz program creates a temporary file in an insecure manner
    in /tmp using a predictable filename, so an attacker with local
    access can easily create and overwrite files as another user.</li>
</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 141-18.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody), in version 133-2.2 of the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 141-20 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your IM package.</p>
