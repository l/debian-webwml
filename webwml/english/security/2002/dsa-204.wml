<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The KDE team has <a href="http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20021111-1.txt">\
discovered</a> a vulnerability in the support for various
network protocols via the KIO The implementation of the rlogin and
protocol allows a carefully crafted URL in an HTML page, HTML email or
other KIO-enabled application to execute arbitrary commands on the
system using the victim's account on the vulnerable machine.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed by disabling rlogin and telnet in version
2.2.2-13.woody.5 for the current stable distribution (woody) and in
version 2.2.2-14.1 for the unstable distribution (sid).  The old
stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't contain
KDE.</p>

is not yet available.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs3 package immediately.</p>
