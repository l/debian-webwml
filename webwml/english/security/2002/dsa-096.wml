<define-tag moreinfo>
Joost Pol found a buffer overflow in the address handling code of
mutt (a popular mail user agent). Even though this is a one byte
overflow this is exploitable.

<p>This has been fixed upstream in version 1.2.5.1 and 1.3.25. The
relevant patch has been added to version 1.2.5-5 of the Debian
package.
