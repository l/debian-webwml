<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>fc found a buffer overflow in the variable expansion code
used by sudo for its prompt. Since sudo is necessarily installed suid
root a local user can use this to gain root access.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.6.2-2.2 for the stable distribution
of Debian and version 1.6.6-1 for the testing/unstable distribution.
We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package immediately.</p>
