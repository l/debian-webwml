<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A serious security violation in PAM was discovered.
Disabled passwords (i.e. those with '*' in the
password file) were classified as empty password and access to such
accounts is granted through the regular login procedure (getty,
telnet, ssh).  This works for all such accounts whose shell field in
the password file does not refer to <code>/bin/false</code>.
Only version 0.76 of PAM seems to be affected by this problem.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.76-6 for the current unstable
distribution (sid).  The stable distribution (woody), the old stable
distribution (potato) and the testing distribution (sarge) are not
affected by this problem.</p>

<p>As stated in the Debian security team <a href="$(HOME)/security/faq">\
FAQ</a>, testing
and unstable are rapidly moving targets and the security team does not
have the resources needed to properly support those.  This security
advisory is an exception to that rule, due to the seriousness of the
problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PAM packages immediately if you are
running Debian/unstable.</p>
