<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nathan Wallwork <a href="http://linux-ha.org/security/sec01.txt">\
discovered</a> a buffer overflow in heartbeat, a subsystem
for High-Availability Linux.  A remote attacker could send a specially
crafted UDP packet that overflows a buffer, leaving heartbeat to
execute arbitrary code as root.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.4.9.0l-7.2 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and version 0.4.9.2-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) doesn't
contain a heartbeat package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heartbeat package immediately if
you run internet connected servers that are heartbeat-monitored.</p>
