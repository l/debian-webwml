<p>While performing an audit of MySQL e-matters found several problems:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>signed/unsigned problem in COM_TABLE_DUMP
 <dd>
  Two sizes were taken as signed integers from a request and then cast
  to unsigned integers without checking for negative numbers. Since the
  resulting numbers where used for a memcpy() operation this could lead
  to memory corruption.</li>

 <dt>Password length handling in COM_CHANGE_USER
 <dd>
  When re-authenticating to a different user MySQL did not perform
  all checks that are performed on initial authentication. This created
  two problems:
  <ul>
  <li> it allowed for single-character password brute forcing (as was fixed in
    February 2000 for initial login) which could be used by a normal user to
    gain root privileges to the database</li>
  <li> it was possible to overflow the password buffer and force the server
    to execute arbitrary code</li>
  </ul></li>

 <dt>read_rows() overflow in libmysqlclient
 <dd>
  When processing the rows returned by a SQL server there was no check
  for overly large rows or terminating NUL characters. This can be used
  to exploit SQL clients if they connect to a compromised MySQL server.</li>

 <dt>read_one_row() overflow in libmysqlclient
 <dd>
  When processing a row as returned by a SQL server the returned field
  sizes were not verified. This can be used to exploit SQL clients if they
  connect to a compromised MySQL server.</li>
</dl>

<p>For Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody this has been fixed in version 3.23.49-8.2
and version 3.22.32-6.3 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2/potato.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages as soon as possible.</p>
