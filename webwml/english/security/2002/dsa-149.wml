<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow bug has been discovered in the RPC library used by
GNU libc, which is derived from the SunRPC library.  This bug could be
exploited to gain unauthorized root access to software linking to this
code.  The packages below also fix integer overflows in the malloc
code.  They also contain a fix from Andreas Schwab to reduce
linebuflen in parallel to bumping up the buffer pointer in the NSS DNS
code.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.1.3-23 for the old stable
distribution (potato), in version 2.2.5-11.1 for the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.5-13 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libc6 packages immediately.</p>
