<define-tag description>remote DoS / exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mark Litchfield found a denial of service attack in the Apache
web-server. While investigating the problem the Apache Software
Foundation discovered that the code for handling invalid requests which
use chunked encoding also might allow arbitrary code execution on 64
bit architectures.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.3.9-14.1 of the Debian apache package,
as well as upstream versions 1.3.26 and 2.0.37. We strongly recommend
that you upgrade your apache package immediately.</p>

<p>The package upgrade does not restart the apache server automatically,
this will have to be done manually. Please make sure your
configuration is correct ("<kbd>apachectl configtest</kbd>" will verify that for
you) and restart it using "<kbd>/etc/init.d/apache restart</kbd>"</p>
