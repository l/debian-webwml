<define-tag description>buffer overflow / DoS</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The libapache-mod-ssl package provides SSL capability to the apache
webserver.
Recently, a problem has been found in the handling of .htaccess files,
allowing arbitrary code execution as the web server user (regardless of
ExecCGI / suexec settings), DoS attacks (killing off apache children), and
allowing someone to take control of apache child processes - all through
specially crafted .htaccess files.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in the libapache-mod-ssl_2.4.10-1.3.9-1potato2 package
(for potato), and the libapache-mod-ssl_2.8.9-2 package (for woody).
We recommend you upgrade as soon as possible.</p>
