<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in Interchange, an e-commerce and
general HTTP database display system, which can lead to an attacker
being able to read any file to which the user of the Interchange
daemon has sufficient permissions, when Interchange runs in "INET
mode" (internet domain socket).  This is not the default setting in
Debian packages, but configurable with Debconf and via configuration
file.  We also believe that this bug cannot exploited on a regular
Debian system.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed by the package maintainer in version
4.8.3.20020306-1.woody.1 for the current stable distribution (woody)
and in version 4.8.6-1 for the unstable distribution (sid).  The old
stable distribution (potato) is not affected, since it doesn't ship
the Interchange system.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your interchange packages.</p>
