<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An internal audit by the xpilot (a multi-player tactical manoeuvring
game for X) maintainers revealed a buffer overflow in xpilot server.
This overflow can be abused by remote attackers to gain access to
the server under which the xpilot server is running.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in upstream version 4.5.1 and version
4.1.0-4.U.4alpha2.4.potato1 of the Debian package.</p>
