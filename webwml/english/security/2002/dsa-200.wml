<define-tag description>remote exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Langasek found an exploitable bug in the password handling
code in samba: when converting from DOS code-page to little endian
UCS2 unicode a buffer length was not checked and a buffer could
be overflowed. There is no known exploit for this, but an upgrade
is strongly recommended.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.2.3a-12 of the Debian
samba packages and upstream version 2.2.7.</p>
