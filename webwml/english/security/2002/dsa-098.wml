<define-tag description>format string vulnerability and buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two different problems where found in libgtop-daemon:</p>

<ul>
<li> The laboratory intexxia found a format string problem in the logging
  code from libgtop_daemon. There were two logging functions which are
  called when authorizing a client which could be exploited by a remote
  user.

<li> Flavio Veloso found a buffer overflow in the function that authorizes
  clients
</ul>
  
<p>Since libgtop_daemon runs as user nobody both bugs could be used
to gain access as the nobody user to a system running libgtop_daemon.</p>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 1.0.6-1.1 and we recommend
you upgrade your libgtop-daemon package immediately.</p>
