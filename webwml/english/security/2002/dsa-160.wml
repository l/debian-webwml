<define-tag description>insecure temporary file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Spybreak discovered a problem in scrollkeeper, a free electronic
cataloging system for documentation.  The scrollkeeper-get-cl program
creates temporary files in an insecure manner in /tmp using guessable
filenames.  Since scrollkeeper is called automatically when a user
logs into a Gnome session, an attacker with local access can easily
create and overwrite files as another user.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.3.6-3.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.3.11-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected, since it doesn't contain the scrollkeeper package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your scrollkeeper packages immediately.</p>
