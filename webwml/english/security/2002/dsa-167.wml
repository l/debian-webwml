<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cross site scripting problem has been discovered in Konquerer, a
famous browser for KDE and other programs using KHTML.  The KDE team
<a href="http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20020908-2.txt">reports</a>
that Konqueror's cross site scripting protection fails to
initialize the domains on sub-(i)frames correctly.  As a result,
Javascript is able to access any foreign subframe which is defined in
the HTML source.  Users of Konqueror and other KDE software that uses
the KHTML rendering engine may become victim of a cookie stealing and
other cross site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 2.2.2-13.woody.3 for the
current stable distribution (woody) and in version 2.2.2-14 for the
unstable distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is
not affected since it didn't ship KDE.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs package and restart
Konquerer.</p>
