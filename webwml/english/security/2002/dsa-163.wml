ways to exploit cross site
scripting bugs in mhonarc, a mail to HTML converter.  When processing
maliciously crafted mails of type text/html, mhonarc, does not
deactivate all scripting parts properly.  This is fixed in upstream
version 2.5.3.</p>

<p>If you are worried about security, it is recommended that you disable
support of text/html messages in your mail archives.  There is no
guarantee that the mhtxthtml.pl library is robust enough to eliminate
all possible exploits that can occur with HTML data.</p>

<p>To exclude HTML data, you can use the MIMEEXCS resource.  For example:</p>

<pre>
   <MIMEExcs>
    text/html
    text/x-html
    </MIMEExcs>
</pre>

<p>The use of "text/x-html" is probably not used any more, but is good to
include it, just-in-case.</p>

<p>If you are concerend that this could block out the entire contents of
some messages, then you could do the following instead:</p>

<pre>
   <MIMEFilters>
    text/html; m2h_text_plain::filter; mhtxtplain.pl
    text/x-html; m2h_text_plain::filter; mhtxtplain.pl
    </MIMEFilters>
</pre>

<p>This treats the HTML as text/plain.</p>

<p>The above problems have been fixed in version 2.5.2-1.1 for the
current stable distribution (woody), in version 2.4.4-1.1 for
the old stable distribution (potato) and in version 2.5.11-1 for the
unstable distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mhonarc packages.</p>
