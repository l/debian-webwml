<define-tag description>remote DoS / exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mark Litchfield found a denial of service attack in the Apache
web-server. While investigating the problem the Apache Software
Foundation discovered that the code for handling invalid requests which
use chunked encoding also might allow arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.3.9-14.1-1.21.20000309-1 of the Debian
apache-perl package and we recommend that you upgrade your apache-perl
package immediately.</p>

<p>An update for the soon to be released Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody
distribution will be available soon.</p>
