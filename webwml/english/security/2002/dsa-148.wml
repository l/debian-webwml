<define-tag description>buffer overflows and format string vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A set of problems have been discovered in Hylafax, a flexible
client/server fax software distributed with many GNU/Linux
distributions.  Quoting SecurityFocus the problems are in detail:</p>

<ul>
<li>A format string vulnerability makes it possible for users to
   potentially execute arbitrary code on some implementations.  Due to
   insufficient checking of input, it's possible to execute a format
   string attack.  Since this only affects systems with the faxrm and
   faxalter programs installed setuid, Debian is not vulnerable.</li>

<li>A buffer overflow has been reported in Hylafax.  A malicious fax
   transmission may include a long scan line that will overflow a
   memory buffer, corrupting adjacent memory.  An exploid may result
   in a denial of service condition, or possibly the execution of
   arbitrary code with root privileges.</li>

<li>A format string vulnerability has been discovered in faxgetty.
   Incoming fax messages include a Transmitting Subscriber
   Identification (TSI) string, used to identify the sending fax
   machine.  Hylafax uses this data as part of a format string without
   properly sanitizing the input.  Malicious fax data may cause the
   server to crash, resulting in a denial of service condition.</li>

<li>Marcin Dawcewicz discovered a format string vulnerability in hfaxd,
   which will crash hfaxd under certain circumstances.  Since Debian
   doesn't have hfaxd installed setuid root, this problem can not
   directly lead into a vulnerability.  This has been fixed by Darren
   Nickerson, which was already present in newer versions, but not in
   the potato version.</li>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 4.0.2-14.3 for the old
stable distribution (potato), in version 4.1.1-1.1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 4.1.2-2.1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax packages.</p>
