<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several buffer overflows were fixed in the "ncurses" library in November
2000.  Unfortunately, one was missed.  This can lead to crashes when using
ncurses applications in large windows.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/">Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project</a> has assigned the name CAN-2002-0062 to this issue.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed for the stable release of Debian in version
5.0-6.0potato2.  The testing and unstable releases contain ncurses 5.2,
which is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>There are no known exploits for this problem, but we recommend that all
users upgrade ncurses immediately.</p>
