<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem with user privileges has been discovered in the Mantis
package, a PHP based bug tracking system.  The Mantis system didn't
check whether a user is permitted to view a bug, but displays it right
away if the user entered a valid bug id.</p>

<p>Another bug in Mantis caused the 'View Bugs' page to list bugs from
both public and private projects when no projects are accessible to
the current user.</p>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 0.17.1-2.5 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.17.5-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected, since it doesn't contain the mantis package.</p>
