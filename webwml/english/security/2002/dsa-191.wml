<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several cross site scripting vulnerabilities have been found in
squirrelmail, a feature-rich webmail package written in PHP4.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project identified the
following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ol>
<li>CAN-2002-1131: User input is not always sanitized so execution of
    arbitrary code on a client computer is possible.  This can happen
    after following a malicious URL or by viewing a malicious
    addressbook entry.</li>

<li>CAN-2002-1132: Another problem could make it possible for an
    attacker to gain sensitive information under some conditions.
    When a malformed argument is appended to a link, an error page
    will be generated which contains the absolute pathname of the
    script.  However, this information is available through the
    Contents file of the distribution anyway.</li>
</ol>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 1.2.6-1.1 the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.8-1.1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) is not
affected since it doesn't contain a squirrelmail package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
