<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>A cross-site scripting (CSS) problem was discovered in Horde and IMP (a web
based IMAP mail package). This was fixed upstream in Horde version 1.2.8
and IMP version 2.2.8. The relevant patches have been back-ported to 
version 1.2.6-0.potato.5 of the horde package and version 2.2.6-0.potato.5
of the imp package.</p>

<p>This release also fixes a bug introduced by the PHP security fix from 
<a href="dsa-115">DSA-115-1</a>: Postgres support for PHP was changed
in a subtle way which broke the Postgres support from IMP.</p>
