<p>A problem in the Courier sqwebmail package, a CGI program to grant
authenticated access to local mailboxes, has been discovered.  The
program did not drop permissions fast enough upon startup under
certain circumstances so a local shell user can execute the sqwebmail
binary and manage to read an arbitrary file on the local filesystem.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.37.3-2.3 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 0.40.0-1 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  The old stable distribution (potato) does not
contain Courier sqwebmail packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sqwebmail package immediately.</p>
