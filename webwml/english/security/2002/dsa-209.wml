<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two problems have been found in the wget package as distributed in
Debian GNU/Linux:</p>

<ul>
<li> Stefano Zacchiroli found a buffer overrun in the url_filename function,
  which would make wget segfault on very long URLs</li>

<li> Steven M. Christey discovered that wget did not verify the FTP server
  response to a NLST command: it must not contain any directory information,
  since that can be used to make a FTP client overwrite arbitrary files.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 1.5.3-3.1 for Debian GNU/Linux
2.2/potato and version 1.8.1-6.1 for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody.</p>
