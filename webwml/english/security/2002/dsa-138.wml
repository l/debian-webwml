<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem was found in gallery (a web-based photo album toolkit): it
was possible to pass in the GALLERY_BASEDIR variable remotely. This
made it possible to execute commands under the uid of web-server.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.2.5-7 of the Debian package and upstream
version 1.3.1.</p>
