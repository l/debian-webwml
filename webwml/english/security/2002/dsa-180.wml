<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Thorsten Kukuck discovered a problem in the ypserv program which is
part of the Network Information Services (NIS).  A memory leak in all
versions of ypserv prior to 2.5 is remotely exploitable.  When a
malicious user could request a non-existing map the server will leak
parts of an old domainname and mapname.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 3.9-6.1 for the current stable
distribution (woody), in version 3.8-2.1 for the old stable
distribution (potato) and in version 3.9-6.2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nis package.</p>
