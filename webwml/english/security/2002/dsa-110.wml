<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The authors of CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing System, have found a
potential buffer overflow bug in the code of the CUPS daemon where it
reads the names of attributes.  This affects all versions of CUPS.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.0.4-10 for the stable Debian
distribution and version 1.1.13-2 for the current testing/unstable
distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS packages immediately if you
have them installed.</p>
