discovered</a> a problem in ht://Check's PHP interface.
The PHP interface displays information unchecked which was gathered
from crawled external web servers.  This could lead into a cross site
scripting attack if somebody has control over the server responses of
a remote web server which is crawled by ht://Check.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.1-1.1 for the current stable
distribution (woody) and in version 1.1-1.2 for the unstable release
(sid).  The old stable release (potato) does not contain the htcheck
package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your htcheck package immediately.</p>
