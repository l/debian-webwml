<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered a buffer overflow in the Cyrus IMAP server,
which could be exploited by a remote attacker prior to logging in.  A
malicious user could craft a request to run commands on the server under
the UID and GID of the cyrus server.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.5.19-9.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.5.19-2.2.</p>

<p>For the current unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.5.19-9.10.  The cyrus21-imapd packages are not
vulnerable</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd package.</p>
