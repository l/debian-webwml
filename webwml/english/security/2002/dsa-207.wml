<define-tag description>arbitrary command execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The SuSE security team discovered a vulnerability in kpathsea library
(libkpathsea) which is used by xdvi and dvips.  Both programs call the
system() function insecurely, which allows a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary commands via cleverly crafted DVI files.</p>

<p>If dvips is used in a print filter, this allows a local or remote
attacker with print permission execute arbitrary code as the printer
user (usually lp).</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.0.7+20011202-7.1 for the
current stable distribution (woody), in version 1.0.6-7.3 for the old
stable distribution (potato) and in version 1.0.7+20021025-4 for the
unstable distribution (sid).  xdvik-ja and dvipsk-ja are vulnerable as
well, but link to the kpathsea library dynamically and will
automatically be fixed after a new libkpathsea is installed.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tetex-lib package immediately.</p>
