<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The authors of mtr released a new upstream version, noting a
non-exploitable buffer overflow in their ChangeLog.  Przemyslaw
Frasunek, however, found an <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/137102">\
easy way</a> to exploit this bug, which allows
an attacker to gain access to the raw socket, which makes IP spoofing
and other malicious network activity possible.</p>

<p>The problem has been fixed by the Debian maintainer in version 0.41-6
for the stable distribution of Debian by backporting the upstream fix
and in version 0.48-1 for the testing/unstable distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mtr package immediately.</p>
