<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow bug has been discovered in the RPC library used by
the Kerberos 5 administration system, which is derived from the SunRPC
library.  This bug could be exploited to gain unauthorized root access
to a KDC host.  It is believed that the attacker needs to be able to
authenticate to the kadmin daemon for this attack to be successful.
No exploits are known to exist yet.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.4-5woody1 for the current
stable distribution (woody) and in version 1.2.5-2 for the unstable
distribution (sid).  Debian 2.2 (potato) is not affected since it
doesn't contain krb5 packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kerberos packages immediately.</p>
