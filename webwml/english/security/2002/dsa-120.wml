<a href="http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2002-02/0313.html">\
found</a> a buffer overflow in Apache-SSL and mod_ssl.
With session caching enabled, mod_ssl will serialize SSL session
variables to store them for later use.  These variables were stored in
a buffer of a fixed size without proper boundary checks.</p>

<p>To exploit the overflow, the server must be configured to require client
certificates, and an attacker must obtain a carefully crafted client
certificate that has been signed by a Certificate Authority which is
trusted by the server. If these conditions are met, it would be possible
for an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.3.9.13-4 of Apache-SSL and
version 2.4.10-1.3.9-1potato1 of libapache-mod-ssl for the stable
Debian distribution as well as in version 1.3.23.1+1.47-1 of
Apache-SSL and version 2.8.7-1 of libapache-mod-ssl for the testing
and unstable distribution of Debian.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Apache-SSL and mod_ssl packages.</p>
