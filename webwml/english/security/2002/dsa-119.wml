<define-tag description>local root exploit, remote client exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p><a href="mailto:joost@pine.nl">Joost Pol</a> reports that OpenSSH
versions 2.0 through 3.0.2 have an off-by-one bug in the channel allocation
code. This vulnerability can be exploited by authenticated users to gain
root privilege or by a malicious server exploiting a client with this
bug.</p>

<p>Since Debian 2.2 (potato) shipped with OpenSSH (the "ssh" package)
version 1.2.3, it is not vulnerable to this exploit. No fix is required
for Debian 2.2 (potato).</p>

<p>The Debian unstable and testing archives do include a more recent OpenSSH
(ssh) package. If you are running these pre-release distributions you should
ensure that you are running version 3.0.2p1-8, a patched version which was
added to the unstable archive today, or a later version.</p>
