<p>The Secure Programming Group of the Oulu University did a study on
SNMP implementations and uncovered multiple problems which can
cause problems ranging from Denial of Service attacks to remote
exploits.</p>

<p>New UCD-SNMP packages have been prepared to fix these problems
as well as a few others. The complete list of fixed problems is:</p>

<ul>
<li> When running external programs snmpd used temporary files insecurely</li>
<li> snmpd did not properly reset supplementary groups after changing
  its uid and gid</li>
<li> Modified most code to use buffers instead of fixed-length strings to
  prevent buffer overflows</li>
<li> The ASN.1 parser did not check for negative lengths</li>
<li> The IFINDEX response handling in snmpnetstat did not do a sanity check
  on its input</li>
</ul>

<p>(thanks to Caldera for most of the work on those patches)</p>

<p>The new version is 4.1.1-2.1 and we recommend you upgrade your
snmp packages immediately.</p>
