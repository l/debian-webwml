<p>Rüdiger Kuhlmann, upstream developer of mICQ, a text based ICQ client,
discovered a problem in mICQ.  Receiving certain ICQ message types
that do not contain the required 0xFE separator causes all versions to
crash.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.4.9-0woody3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 0.4.3-4.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.4.9.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your micq package.</p>
