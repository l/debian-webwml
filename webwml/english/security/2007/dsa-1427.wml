<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
Alin Rad Pop discovered that Samba, a LanManager-like file and printer server
for Unix, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the nmbd code which handles
GETDC mailslot requests, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
</p>

<p>
For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in version
samba 3.0.14a-3sarge11. Packages for m68k will be provided later.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
3.0.24-6etch9.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.
