<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba, a free
implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0452">CVE-2007-0452</a>

    <p>It was discovered that incorrect handling of deferred file open calls
    may lead to an infinite loop, which results in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0454">CVE-2007-0454</a>

    <p>"zybadawg333" discovered that the AFS ACL mapping VFS plugin performs
    insecure format string handling, which may lead to the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14a-3sarge4.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.0.23d-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.23d-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba package.</p>
