<p>Kazuhiro Nishiyama found a vulnerability in hiki, a Wiki engine written
in Ruby, which could allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary files
which are writable to the Hiki user, via a specially crafted session
parameter.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.6-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.7-1.</p>
