<define-tag moreinfo>
                 
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2172">CVE-2007-2172</a>

    <p>Thomas Graf reported a typo in the IPv4 protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    The DECnet counterpart of this issue was already fixed in DSA-1356.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2875">CVE-2007-2875</a>

    <p>iDefense reported a potential integer underflow in the cpuset filesystem
    which may permit local attackers to gain access to sensitive kernel
    memory. This vulnerability is only exploitable if the cpuset filesystem
    is mounted.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3105">CVE-2007-3105</a>

    <p>The PaX Team discovered a potential buffer overflow in the random number
    generator which may permit local users to cause a denial of service or
    gain additional privileges. This issue is not believed to effect default
    Debian installations where only root has sufficient privileges to exploit
    it.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3843">CVE-2007-3843</a>

    <p>A coding error in the CIFS subsystem permits the use of unsigned messages
    even if the client has configured the system to enforce
    signing by passing the sec=ntlmv2i mount option. This may allow remote
    attackers to spoof CIFS network traffic.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4308">CVE-2007-4308</a>

    <p>Alan Cox reported an issue in the aacraid driver that allows unprivileged
    local users to make ioctl calls which should be restricted to admin
    privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch2.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>          <th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>     <td>1.17+etch5</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td> <td>2.6.18-1um-2etch4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
