<p>It was discovered that the PostgreSQL database performs insufficient
validation of variables passed to privileged SQL statement called
<q>security definers</q>, which could lead to SQL privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.4.7-6sarge5. A powerpc build is not yet available due to
problems with the build host. It will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.4.17-0etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.4.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.</p>
