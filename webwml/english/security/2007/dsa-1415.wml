<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Tk, a cross-platform graphical toolkit for Tcl
performs insufficient input validation in the code used to load GIF
images, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 8.4.9-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.12-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tk8.4 packages. Updated packages for
sparc will be provided later.</p>
