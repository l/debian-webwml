<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>poppler includes a copy of the xpdf code and required an update as well.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include poppler.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.5-5.1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.</p>
