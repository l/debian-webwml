<define-tag description>authentication bypass</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that reprepro, a tool to create a repository of Debian
packages, only checks the validity of known signatures when updating
from a remote site, and thus does not reject packages with only unknown
signatures. This allows an attacker to bypass this authentication
mechanism.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1+1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your reprepro package.</p>
