<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aaron Plattner discovered a buffer overflow in the Composite extension
of the X.org X server, which can lead to local privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-21etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.</p>
