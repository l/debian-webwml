<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam
anti-virus toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6335">CVE-2007-6335</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the decompression code
    for MEW archives may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6336">CVE-2007-6336</a>

    <p>It was discovered that on off-by-one in the MS-ZIP decompression
    code may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.
However, since the clamav version from Sarge cannot process all current
Clam malware signatures any longer, support for the ClamAV in Sarge is
now discontinued. We recommend to upgrade to the stable distribution
or run a backport of the stable version.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.90.1-3etch8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
