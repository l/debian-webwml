<define-tag description>off-by-one error/buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An off-by-one error has been identified in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers()
routine in the libssl library from OpenSSL, an implementation of Secure
Socket Layer cryptographic libraries and utilities.  This error could
allow an attacker to crash an application making use of OpenSSL's libssl
library, or potentially execute arbitrary code in the security context
of the user running such an application.</p>

<p>
For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in version
0.9.7e-3sarge5.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable and testing distributions (sid and lenny, respectively),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.9.8e-9.
</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
