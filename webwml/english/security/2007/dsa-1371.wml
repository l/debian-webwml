<p>
Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpWiki, a wiki engine
written in PHP. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:
</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2024">CVE-2007-2024</a>

    <p>
    It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name 
    validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2025">CVE-2007-2025</a>

    <p>
    It was discovered that phpWiki performs insufficient file name 
    validation, which allows unrestricted file uploads.
    </p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3193">CVE-2007-3193</a>

    <p>
    If the configuration lacks a nonzero PASSWORD_LENGTH_MINIMUM,
    phpWiki might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via
    an empty password, which causes ldap_bind to return true when used
    with certain LDAP implementations.
    </p></li>

</ul>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain phpwiki packages.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12p3-5etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12p3-6.1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your phpwiki package.
