<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby, an object-oriented
scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5162">CVE-2007-5162</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient
    validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle
    attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5770">CVE-2007-5770</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which
    may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.1.4a-1sarge1. Packages for sparc will be provided later.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) no longer contains libopenssl-ruby.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libopenssl-ruby packages.</p>
