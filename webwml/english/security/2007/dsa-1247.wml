<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An off-by-one error leading to a heap-based buffer overflow has been
identified in libapache-mod-auth-kerb, an Apache module for Kerberos
authentication.  The error could allow an attacker to trigger an
application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code by sending a
specially crafted kerberos message.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.996-5.0-rc6-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the forthcoming stable distribution
(etch), this problem has been fixed in version 5.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-auth-kerb package.</p>
