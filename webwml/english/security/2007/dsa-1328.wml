<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that
unicon-imc2, a Chinese input method library, makes unsafe use of
an environmental variable, which may be exploited to execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.4-11etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unicon-imc2 package.</p>
