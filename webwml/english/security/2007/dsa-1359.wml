<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
It was discovered that dovecot, a secure mail server that supports mbox
and maildir mailboxes, when configured to use non-system-user spools
and compressed folders, may allow directory traversal in mailbox names.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem was not present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.rc15-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot package.</p>
