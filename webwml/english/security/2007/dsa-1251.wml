<define-tag description>insufficient escaping</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that netrik, a text mode WWW browser with vi like
keybindings, doesn't properly sanitize temporary filenames when editing
textareas which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands via
shell metacharacters.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in version
1.15.4-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.3-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in version
1.15.3-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netrik package.</p>
