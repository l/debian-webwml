<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Cornelius and Reimar Doeffinger discovered that the MPlayer movie
player performs insufficient boundary checks when accessing CDDB data,
which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include MPlayer packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0~rc1-12etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0~rc1-14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer package.</p>
