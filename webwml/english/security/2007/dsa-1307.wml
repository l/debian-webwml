<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>John Heasman discovered a heap overflow in the routines of OpenOffice.org
that parse RTF files.  A specially crafted RTF file could cause the
filter to overwrite data on the heap, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1~rc1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
