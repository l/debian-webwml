<p>It was discovered that ruby-gnome2, the GNOME-related bindings for the Ruby
language, didn't properly sanitize input prior to constructing dialogs.
This could allow the execution of arbitrary code if untrusted input
is displayed within a dialog.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.0-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.15.0-1.1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.0-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-gnome2 package.</p>
