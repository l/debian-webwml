<p>John Heasman from Next Generation Security Software discovered a heap
overflow in the handling of Windows Metafiles in OpenOffice.org, the
free office suite, which could lead to a denial of service and
potentially execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-1.</p>
