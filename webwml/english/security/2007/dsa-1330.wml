<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1399">CVE-2007-1399</a>
    
    <p>Stefan Esser discovered that a buffer overflow in the zip extension
    allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1864">CVE-2007-1864</a>
    
    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the xmlrpc extension
    allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>
    
<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include php5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.0-8+etch7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the littleendian Mips architecture are not yet available, due to problems on the
build host. They will be provided later.</p>
