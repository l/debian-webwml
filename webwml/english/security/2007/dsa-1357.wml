<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>koffice includes a copy of the xpdf code and required an update as well.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) will be fixed later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your koffice packages.</p>
