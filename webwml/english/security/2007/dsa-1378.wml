<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3731">CVE-2007-3731</a>

    <p>Evan Teran discovered a potential local denial of service (oops) in
    the handling of PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3739">CVE-2007-3739</a>

    <p>Adam Litke reported a potential local denial of service (oops) on
    powerpc platforms resulting from unchecked VMA expansion into address
    space reserved for hugetlb pages.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3740">CVE-2007-3740</a>

    <p>Matt Keenan reported that CIFS filesystems with CAP_UNIX enabled 
    were not honoring a process' umask which may lead to unintentionally
    relaxed permissions.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4573">CVE-2007-4573</a>

    <p>Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited
    by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems.
    This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers
    during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant
    to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run
    the amd64 linux-image flavour.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4849">CVE-2007-4849</a>

    <p>Michael Stone reported an issue with the JFFS2 filesystem. Legacy
    modes for inodes that were created with POSIX ACL support enabled
    were not being written out to the medium, resulting in incorrect
    permissions upon remount.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch3.</p>

<p>This advisory has been updated to include a build for the arm
architecture, which was not yet available at the time of DSA-1378-1.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>          <th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>     <td>1.17+etch.13etch3</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td> <td>2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch3</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
