<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hamid Ebadi discovered a buffer overflow in the
intT1_Env_GetCompletePath routine in t1lib, a Type 1 font rasterizer
library.  This flaw could allow an attacker to crash an application
using the t1lib shared libraries, and potentially execute arbitrary code
within such an application's security context.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-2etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your t1lib package.</p>
