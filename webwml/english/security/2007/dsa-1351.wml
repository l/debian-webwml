<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that bochs, a highly portable IA-32 PC emulator,
is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the emulated NE2000 network device
driver, which may lead to privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1+20041109-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3+20070705-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bochs packages.</p>
