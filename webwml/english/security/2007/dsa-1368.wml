<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow of the library for secure RPC
communication over the rpcsec_gss protocol allows the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain librpcsecgss.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your librpcsecgss packages.</p>
