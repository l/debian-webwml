<p>Omer Singer of the DigiTrust Group discovered several vulnerabilities in
phpMyAdmin, an application to administrate MySQL over the WWW. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5589">CVE-2007-5589</a>

    <p>phpMyAdmin allows a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script
    or HTML in the context of a logged in user's session (cross site
    scripting).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5386">CVE-2007-5386</a>

    <p>phpMyAdmin, when accessed by a browser that does not URL-encode
    requests, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script
    or HTML via the query string.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.6.2-3sarge6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.9.1.1-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:2.11.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
