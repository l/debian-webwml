<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in
open-iscsi, a transport-independent iSCSI implementation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3099">CVE-2007-3099</a>

    <p>Olaf Kirch discovered that due to a programming error access to the
    management interface socket was insufficiently protected, which allows
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3100">CVE-2007-3100</a>

    <p>Olaf Kirch discovered that access to a semaphore used in the logging
    code was insufficiently protected, allowing denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include open-iscsi.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.730-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.865-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your open-iscsi packages.</p>
