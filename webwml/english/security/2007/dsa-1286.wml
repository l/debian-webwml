<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0005">CVE-2007-0005</a>

    <p>Daniel Roethlisberger discovered two buffer overflows in the cm4040
    driver for the Omnikey CardMan 4040 device. A local user or malicious
    device could exploit this to execute arbitrary code in kernel space.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0958">CVE-2007-0958</a>

    <p>Santosh Eraniose reported a vulnerability that allows local users to read
    otherwise unreadable files by triggering a core dump while using PT_INTERP.
    This is related to <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-1073">CVE-2004-1073</a>.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1357">CVE-2007-1357</a>

    <p>Jean Delvare reported a vulnerability in the appletalk subsystem.
    Systems with the appletalk module loaded can be triggered to crash
    by other systems on the local network via a malformed frame.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1592">CVE-2007-1592</a>

    <p>Masayuki Nakagawa discovered that flow labels were inadvertently
    being shared between listening sockets and child sockets. This defect
    can be exploited by local users to cause a DoS (Oops).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This problem has been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-12etch1.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th></th>                	<th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>	<td>1.17etch1</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td>	<td>2.6.18-1um-2etch1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>

<p>Updated packages for the mips and mipsel architectures are not yet available.
They will be provided later.</p>
