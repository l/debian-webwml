<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Qt GUI
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3388">CVE-2007-3388</a>

    <p>Tim Brown and Dirk Müller discovered several format string
    vulnerabilities in the handling of error messages, which might lead
    to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4137">CVE-2007-4137</a>

    <p>Dirk Müller discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in the Unicode
    handling, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed
in version 3:3.3.4-3sarge3. Packages for m68k will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3:3.3.7-4etch1.</p>
