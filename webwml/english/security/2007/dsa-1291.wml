<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been identified in Samba, the SMB/CIFS
file- and print-server implementation for GNU/Linux.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2444">CVE-2007-2444</a>
    <p>When translating SIDs to/from names using Samba local list of user and
    group accounts, a logic error in the smbd daemon's internal security
    stack may result in a transition to the root user id rather than the
    non-root user.  The user is then able to temporarily issue SMB/CIFS
    protocol operations as the root user.  This window of opportunity may
    allow the attacker to establish addition means of gaining root access to
    the server.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2446">CVE-2007-2446</a>
    <p>Various bugs in Samba's NDR parsing can allow a user to send specially
    crafted MS-RPC requests that will overwrite the heap space with user
    defined data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2447">CVE-2007-2447</a>
    <p>Unescaped user input parameters are passed as arguments to /bin/sh
    allowing for remote command execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.24-6etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing and unstable distributions (lenny and sid,
respectively), these problems have been fixed in version 3.0.25-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba package.</p>
