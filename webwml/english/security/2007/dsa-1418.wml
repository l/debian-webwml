<p>It was discovered that Cacti, a tool to monitor systems and networks,
performs insufficient input sanitising, which allows SQL injection.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6c-7sarge5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6i-3.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
