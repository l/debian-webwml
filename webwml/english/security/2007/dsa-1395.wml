<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that xen-utils,
a collection of XEN administrative tools, used temporary files insecurely
within the xenmon tool allowing local users to truncate arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in version
3.0.3-0-4.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this package was not present.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen-3.0 (3.0.3-0-4) package.</p>
