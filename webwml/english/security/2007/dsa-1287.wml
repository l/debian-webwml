<p>Two vulnerabilities have been identified in the version of
ldap-account-manager shipped with Debian 3.1 (sarge).</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-7191">CVE-2006-7191</a>
    <p>An untrusted PATH vulnerability could allow a local attacker to execute
    arbitrary code with elevated privileges by providing a malicious rm
    executable and specifying a PATH environment variable referencing this
    executable.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1840">CVE-2007-1840</a>
    <p>Improper escaping of HTML content could allow an attacker to execute a
    cross-site scripting attack (XSS) and execute arbitrary code in the
    victim's browser in the security context of the affected web site.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.9-2sarge1.  Newer versions of Debian (etch, lenny, and sid),
are not affected.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldap-account-manager package.</p>
