<p>
Bas van Schaik discovered that the agentd process of Zabbix, a network
monitor system, may run user-supplied commands as group id root, not
zabbix, which may lead to a privilege escalation.
</p>

<p>
zabbix is not included in the oldstable distribution (sarge).
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.1.4-10etch1
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.
