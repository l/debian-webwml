<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
Henning Pingel discovered that TYPO3, a web content management framework,
performs insufficient input sanitising, making it vulnerable to SQL
injection by logged-in backend users.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain typo3-src.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2+debian-4.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid) and for the testing distribution
(lenny), this problem has been fixed in version 4.1.5-1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.
