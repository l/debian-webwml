<p>It was discovered that the Bind name server daemon is vulnerable to denial
of service by triggering an assertion through a crafted DNS query. This
only affects installations which use the DNSSEC extentions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.2.4-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 package.</p>
