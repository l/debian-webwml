<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1496">CVE-2007-1496</a>

    <p>Michal Miroslaw reported a DoS vulnerability (crash) in netfilter.
    A remote attacker can cause a NULL pointer dereference in the
    nfnetlink_log function.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1497">CVE-2007-1497</a>

    <p>Patrick McHardy reported an vulnerability in netfilter that may
    allow attackers to bypass certain firewall rules. The nfctinfo
    value of reassembled IPv6 packet fragments were incorrectly initialized
    to 0 which allowed these packets to become tracked as ESTABLISHED.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1861">CVE-2007-1861</a>

    <p>Jaco Kroon reported a bug in which NETLINK_FIB_LOOKUP packages were
    incorrectly routed back to the kernel resulting in an infinite
    recursion condition. Local users can exploit this behavior
    to cause a DoS (crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-12etch2.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th></th>                	<th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>	<td>1.17+etch2</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td>	<td>2.6.18-1um-2etch2</td></tr>
<tr><td>kernel-patch-openvz</td><td>028.18.1etch1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
