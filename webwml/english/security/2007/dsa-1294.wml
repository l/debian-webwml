<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window System,
which may lead to privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1003">CVE-2007-1003</a>

    <p>Sean Larsson discovered an integer overflow in the XC-MISC extension,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1351">CVE-2007-1351</a>

    <p>Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1352">CVE-2007-1352</a>

    <p>Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in the font handling,
    which might lead to denial of service or local privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1667">CVE-2007-1667</a>

    <p>Sami Leides discovered an integer overflow in the libx11 library
    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
    This update introduces tighter sanity checking of input passed to
    XCreateImage(). To cope with this an updated rdesktop package is
    delivered along with this security update. Another application
    reported to break is the proprietary Opera browser, which isn't
    part of Debian. The vendor has released updated packages, though.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge4. This update lacks builds for the Sparc
architecture, due to problems on the build host. Packages will be released
once this problem has been resolved.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected by these problems, as the
vulnerabilities have already been fixed during the Etch preparation
freeze phase.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your XFree86 packages.</p>
