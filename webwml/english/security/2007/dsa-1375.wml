<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the TIFF parsing
code of the OpenOffice.org suite.  The parser uses untrusted values
from the TIFF file to calculate the number of bytes of memory to
allocate.  A specially crafted TIFF image could trigger an integer
overflow and subsequently a buffer overflow that could cause the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-9.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0~src680m224-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
