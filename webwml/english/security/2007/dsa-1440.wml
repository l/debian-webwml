<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the filename processing of
the inotify-tools, a command-line interface to inotify, may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code. This only affects the internal 
library and none of the frontend tools shipped in Debian.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) does not provide inotify-tools.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3-2.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.11-1.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your inotify-tools package.
