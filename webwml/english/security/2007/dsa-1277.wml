<p>Multiple errors have been found in the skin handling routines in xmms,
the X Multimedia System.  These vulnerabilities could allow an
attacker to run arbitrary code as the user running xmms by inducing
the victim to load specially crafted interface skin files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.10+cvs20050209-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distrubution (etch) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in versions
1:1.2.10+20061101-1etch1 and 1:1.2.10+20070401-1, respectively.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmms packages.</p>
