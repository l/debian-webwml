<p>Michael Skibbe discovered that htdig, a WWW search system for an intranet
or small internet, did not adequately quote values submitted to the search
script, allowing remote attackers to inject arbitrary script or HTML
into specially crafted links.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem was not present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1:3.2.0b6-3.1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1:3.2.0b6-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your htdig package.</p>
