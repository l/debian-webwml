<p>Fixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there
will be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't
have the resources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla
products. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.0.4-0etch1. A build for the Alpha architecture is not yet available, it will
be provided later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.0.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
