<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>tetex-bin includes a copy of the xpdf code and required an update as
well.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-30sarge5.</p>

<p>The package from the stable distribution (etch) links dynamically
against libpoppler and doesn't require a separate update.</p>

<p>The package from the unstable distribution (sid) links dynamically
against libpoppler and doesn't require a separate update.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tetex-bin packages.</p>
