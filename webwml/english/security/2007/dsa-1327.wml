<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that gsambad,
a GTK+ configuration tool for samba, uses temporary files in an unsafe
manner which may be exploited to truncate arbitary files from the local system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gsambad package.</p>
