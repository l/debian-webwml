<p>Alin Rad Pop discovered that link-grammar, Carnegie Mellon University's
link grammar parser for English, performed insufficient validation within
its tokenizer, which could allow a malicious input file to execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
4.2.2-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this package was not present.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was fixed in version
4.2.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your link-grammar package.</p>
