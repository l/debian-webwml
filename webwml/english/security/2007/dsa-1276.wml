<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference
implementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0956">CVE-2007-0956</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the krb5 telnet daemon performs insufficient
    validation of usernames, which might allow unauthorized logins or
    privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0957">CVE-2007-0957</a>

    <p>iDefense discovered that a buffer overflow in the logging code of the
    KDC and the administration daemon might lead to arbitrary code
    execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1216">CVE-2007-1216</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a double free in the RPCSEC_GSS part of the 
    GSS library code might lead to arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge4.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.4-7etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.</p>
