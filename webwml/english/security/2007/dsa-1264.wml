<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a server-side,
HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0906">CVE-2007-0906</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the str_replace()
    function could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0907">CVE-2007-0907</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a buffer underflow in the sapi_header_op()
    function could crash the PHP interpreter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0908">CVE-2007-0908</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered that a programming error in the wddx
    extension allows information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0909">CVE-2007-0909</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a format string vulnerability in the
    odbc_result_all() functions allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0910">CVE-2007-0910</a>

    <p>It was discovered that super-global variables could be overwritten
    with session data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-0988">CVE-2007-0988</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered that the zend_hash_init() function could
    be tricked into an endless loop, allowing denial of service through
    resource consumption until a timeout is triggered.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.3.10-19.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 6:4.4.4-9 of php4 and version 5.2.0-9 of php5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php4 packages.</p>
