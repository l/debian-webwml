identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5162">CVE-2007-5162</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient
    validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.2-7sarge6. Packages for sparc will be provided later.</p>
