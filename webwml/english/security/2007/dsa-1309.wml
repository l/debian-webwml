<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in libexif, a library to parse EXIF
files, which allows denial of service and possible execution of arbitary
code via malformed EXIF data.</p>

<p>For the old-stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.6.9-6sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libexif (0.6.9-6sarge1) package.</p>
