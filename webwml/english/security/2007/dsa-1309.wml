<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the PostgreSQL database performs insufficient
validation of variables passed to privileged SQL statements, so called
"security definers", which could lead to SQL privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain PostgreSQL 8.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1.9-0etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.</p>
