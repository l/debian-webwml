<p>It was discovered that the image loading code in the GTK+ graphical user
interface library performs insufficient error handling when loading
malformed images, which may lead to denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.4-3.2. This update lacks builds for the Motorola 680x0
architecture, which had build problems. Packages will be released once
this problem has been resolved.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.8.20-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.20-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your GTK packages.</p>
