<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been dicovered in the man command that could
allow an attacker to execute code as the man user by providing
specially crafted arguments to the -H flag.  This is likely to be an
issue only on machines with the man and mandb programs installed
setuid.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-21sarge1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.3-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your man-db package.</p>
