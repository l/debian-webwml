<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the ftp extension of PHP, a server-side,
HTML-embedded scripting language performs insufficient input sanitising,
which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary FTP commands. This
requires the attacker to already have access to the FTP server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed
in version 4.3.10-21.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed
in version 4.4.4-8+etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem won't be fixed, as php4
will be removed from sid; thus you are strongly advised to migrate to
php5 if you prefer to follow the unstable distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the Sparc
architectures are not yet available, due to problems on the build host. They
will be provided later.</p>
