<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sumit I. Siddharth discovered that Gforge, a collaborative development
tool performs insufficient input sanitising, which allows SQL injection. </p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1-31sarge2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.14-22etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge package.</p>
