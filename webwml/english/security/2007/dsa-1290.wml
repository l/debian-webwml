<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the webmail package Squirrelmail performs
insufficient sanitising inside the HTML filter, which allows the
injection of arbitrary web script code during the display of HTML
email messages.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.10a-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
