<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceape internet
suite, an unbranded version of the Seamonkey Internet Suite. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1362">CVE-2007-1362</a>

    <p>Nicolas Derouet discovered that Iceape performs insufficient 
    validation of cookies, which could lead to denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1558">CVE-2007-1558</a>

    <p>Gatan Leurent discovered a cryptographical weakness in APOP
    authentication, which reduces the required efforts for an MITM attack
    to intercept a password. The update enforces stricter validation, which
    prevents this attack.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2867">CVE-2007-2867</a>
 
    Boris Zbarsky, Eli Friedman, Georgi Guninski, Jesse Ruderman, Martijn
    Wargers and Olli Pettay discovered crashes in the layout engine, which
    might allow the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2868">CVE-2007-2868</a>

    <p>Brendan Eich, Igor Bukanov, Jesse Ruderman, moz_bug_r_a4 and Wladimir Palant
    discovered crashes in the javascript engine, which might allow the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2870">CVE-2007-2870</a>

    <p>"moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that adding an event listener through the
     addEventListener() function allows cross-site scripting.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2871">CVE-2007-2871</a>

    <p>Chris Thomas discovered that XUL popups can can be abused for spoofing or
    phishing attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Fixes for the oldstable distribution (sarge) are not available. While there
will be another round of security updates for Mozilla products, Debian doesn't
have the ressources to backport further security fixes to the old Mozilla
products. You're strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable as soon as possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.0.9-0etch1. A build for the arm architecture is not yet available, it will
be provided later.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceape packages.</p>
