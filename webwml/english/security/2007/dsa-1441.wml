<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
Luigi Auriemma discovered that PeerCast, a P2P audio and video streaming
server, is vulnerable to a heap overflow in the HTTP server code, which
allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
arbitrary code via a long SOURCE request.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain peercast.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1217.toots.20060314-1etch0.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1218+svn20071220+2.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your peercast packages.
