<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
A problem was discovered with freetype, a FreeType2 font engine, which
could allow the execution of arbitary code via an integer overflow in
specially crafted TTF files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in 
version 2.1.7-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype package.</p>
