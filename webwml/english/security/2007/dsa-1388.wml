<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that dhcp, a DHCP server for automatic IP address assignment,
didn't correctly allocate space for network replies.  This could potentially
allow a malicious DHCP client to execute arbitary code upon the DHCP server.</p>

<p>
For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0pl5-19.1sarge3.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0pl5-19.5etch1.
</p>

<p>
For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp package.
