<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Clam anti-virus
toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4510">CVE-2007-4510</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the RTF and RFC2397 parsers can be tricked
    into dereferencing a NULL pointer, resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4560">CVE-2007-4560</a>

    <p>It was discovered that clamav-milter performs insufficient input
    sanitising, resulting in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) is only affected by a subset of 
the problems. An update will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.90.1-3etch7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.91.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages. </p>
