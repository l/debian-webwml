<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that the original patch for a buffer overflow in
svc_auth_gss.c in the RPCSEC_GSS RPC library in MIT Kerberos 5
(<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3999">CVE-2007-3999</a>,
<a href="dsa-1368">DSA-1368-1</a>) was insufficient to protect from arbitrary
code execution in some environments.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) does not contain a librpcsecgss
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14-2etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your librpcsecgss package.</p>
