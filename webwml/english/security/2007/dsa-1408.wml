<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alin Rad Pop discovered a buffer overflow in kpdf, which could allow
the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is displayed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.5.5-3etch2. Builds for arm and sparc are not yet available.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) will be fixed later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdegraphics packages.</p>
