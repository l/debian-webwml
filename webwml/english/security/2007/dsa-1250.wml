<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that cacti, a frontend to rrdtool, performs insufficient
validation of data passed to the <q>cmd</q> script, which allows SQL
injection and the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6c-7sarge4.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.8.6i-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6i-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.</p>
