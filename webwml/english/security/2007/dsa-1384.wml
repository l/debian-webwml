<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor
packages which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4993">CVE-2007-4993</a>

   <p>By use of a specially crafted grub configuration file a domU user
  may be able to execute arbitary code upon the dom0 when pygrub is
  being used.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1320">CVE-2007-1320</a>

   <p>Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the Cirrus VGA extension,
  provided by QEMU, may allow local users to execute arbitrary code
  via "bitblt" heap overflow.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
3.0.3-0-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen-utils package.</p>
