<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
An integer overflow in the BigInteger data type implementation has been
discovered in the free .NET runtime Mono.
</p>

<p>
The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain mono.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2.1-1etch1. A powerpc build will be provided later.
</p>

<p>
The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.
