<p>This update provides fixed packages for the oldstable distribution (sarge).
For reference the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Amit Klein discovered that the BIND name server generates predictable 
DNS query IDs, which may lead to cache poisoning attacks.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.2.4-1sarge3. An update for mips, powerpc and hppa is not yet
available, they will be released soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-2etch1. An update for mips is not yet available, it will
be released soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your BIND packages.</p>
