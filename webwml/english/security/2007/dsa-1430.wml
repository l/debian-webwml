<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was reported that a race condition exists in libnss-ldap, an
NSS module for using LDAP as a naming service, which could cause
denial of service attacks when applications use pthreads.</p>

<p>This problem was spotted in the dovecot IMAP/POP server but
potentially affects more programs.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
251-7.5etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 238-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 256-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libnss-ldap package.</p>
