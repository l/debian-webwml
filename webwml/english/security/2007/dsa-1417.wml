<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tilghman Lesher discovered that the logging engine of Asterisk, a free
software PBX and telephony toolkit, performs insufficient sanitising of
call-related data, which may lead to SQL injection.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.0.7.dfsg.1-2sarge6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.13~dfsg-2etch2. Updated packages for ia64 will be provided
later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
