<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that rsync, a fast remote file copy program,
contains an off-by-one error which might allow remote attackers to execute
arbitary code via long directory names.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.9-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem is not presnt.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rsync package.</p>
