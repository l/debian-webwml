<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the vim editor. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2953">CVE-2007-2953</a>

    <p>Ulf Harnhammar discovered that a format string flaw in helptags_one() from
    src/ex_cmds.c (triggered through the <q>helptags</q> command) can lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2438">CVE-2007-2438</a>

    <p>Editors often provide a way to embed editor configuration commands (aka
    modelines) which are executed once a file is opened. Harmful commands
    are filtered by a sandbox mechanism. It was discovered that function
    calls to writefile(), feedkeys() and system() were not filtered, allowing
    shell command execution with a carefully crafted file opened in vim.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 6.3-071+1sarge2. Sarge is not affected by <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2438">CVE-2007-2438</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0-122+1etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.1-056+1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vim packages.</p>
