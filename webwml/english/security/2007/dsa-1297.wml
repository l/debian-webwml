<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bernhard R. Link discovered that the CVS browsing interface of Gforge, a
collaborative development tool, performs insufficient escaping of URLs,
which allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands with the privileges
of the www-data user.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.14-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.14-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge-plugin-scmcvs package.</p>
