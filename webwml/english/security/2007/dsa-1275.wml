<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability in zope, a web application
server, could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and/or
JavaScript into the victim's web browser.  This code would run within
the security context of the web browser, potentially allowing the
attacker to access private data such as authentication cookies, or to
affect the rendering or behavior of zope web pages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.5-2sarge4.</p>

<p>The upcoming stable distribution (etch) and the unstable distribution
(sid) include zope2.9, and this vulnerability is fixed in version
2.9.6-4etch1 for etch and 2.9.7-1 for sid.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zope2.7 package.</p>
