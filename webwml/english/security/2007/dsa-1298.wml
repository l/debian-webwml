<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Open Ticket Request System performs
insufficient input sanitising for the Subaction parameter, which allows
the injection of arbitrary web script code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include otrs2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4p01-18.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) isn't affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 package.</p>
