<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MIT reference
implementation of the Kerberos network authentication protocol suite,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2442">CVE-2007-2442</a>

    <p>Wei Wang discovered that the free of an uninitialised pointer in the
    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2443">CVE-2007-2443</a>

    <p>Wei Wang discovered that insufficient input sanitising in the
    Kerberos RPC library may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2798">CVE-2007-2798</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the  Kerberos
    administration daemon may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge5. Packages for hppa, mips and powerpc are not yet
available. They will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7etch2. Packages for hppa and mips are not yet available.
They will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Kerberos packages.</p>
