<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Tk, a cross-platform graphical toolkit for Tcl
performs insufficient input validation in the code used to load GIF
images, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Due to the technical limitation in the Debian archive scripts the update
for the old stable distribution (sarge) cannot be released in sync with
the update for the stable distribution. It will be provided in the next
days.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3.5-6etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tk8.3 packages.</p>
