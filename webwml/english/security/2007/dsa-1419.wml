<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in HSQLDB, the default database
engine shipped with OpenOffice.org.  This could result in the
execution of arbitrary Java code embedded in a OpenOffice.org database
document with the user's privilege.  This update requires an update of
both openoffice.org and hsqldb.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch4 of OpenOffice.org and in version
1.8.0.7-1etch1 of hsqldb.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1-1 of OpenOffice.org and in version 1.8.0.9-2 of hsqldb.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1~rc1-1 of OpenOffice.org and in version 1.8.0.9-1 of
hsqldb.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org and hsqldb packages.</p>
