<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3390">CVE-2007-3390</a>

    <p>Off-by-one overflows were discovered in the iSeries dissector.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3392">CVE-2007-3392</a>

    <p>The MMS and SSL dissectors could be forced into an infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3393">CVE-2007-3393</a>

    <p>An off-by-one overflow was discovered in the DHCP/BOOTP dissector.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) is not affected by these problems.
(In Sarge Wireshark used to be called Ethereal).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.4-5.etch.0. Packages for the big endian MIPS architecture
are not yet available. They will be provided later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.6pre1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Wireshark packages.</p>
