<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer underflow bug has been found in the file_printf function in
file, a tool to determine file types based analysis of file content.
The bug could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by inducing a
local user to examine a specially crafted file that triggers a buffer
overflow.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.12-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.17-5etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
4.20-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your file package.</p>
