<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in centericq,
a text-mode multi-protocol instant messenger client, which could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitary code due to insufficient bounds-testing.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
4.21.0-18etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.20.0-1sarge5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your centericq package.</p>
