<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0207">CVE-2006-0207</a>
    <p>Stefan Esser discovered HTTP response splitting vulnerabilities
    in the session extension. This only affects Debian 3.1 (Sarge).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4486">CVE-2006-4486</a>
    <p>Stefan Esser discovered that an integer overflow in memory allocation
    routines allows the bypass of memory limit restrictions. This only
    affects Debian 3.1 (Sarge) on 64 bit architectures.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1864">CVE-2007-1864</a>
    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the xmlrpc extension
    allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>
    
</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.10-22.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 4.4.4-8+etch4.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains php4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Sarge packages for
hppa, mips and powerpc are not yet available, due to problems on the
build hosts. They will be provided later.</p>
