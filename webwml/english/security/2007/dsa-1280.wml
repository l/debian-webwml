<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that aircrack-ng, a WEP/WPA security analysis tool,
performs insufficient validation of 802.11 authentication packets, which
allows the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain aircrack-ng packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.2-7etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your aircrack-ng packages. Packages for
the arm, sparc, mips and mipsel architectures are not yet available. They
will be provided later.</p>
