<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ktorrent, a BitTorrent client for KDE, was vulnerable
to a directory traversal bug which potentially allowed remote users to
overwrite arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this package was not present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.3+dfsg1-2.2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
2.2.1.dfsg.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ktorrent package.</p>
