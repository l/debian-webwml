<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Ruby, an object-oriented
scripting language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5162">CVE-2007-5162</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby HTTP(S) module performs insufficient
    validation of SSL certificates, which may lead to man-in-the-middle
    attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5770">CVE-2007-5770</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Ruby modules for FTP, Telnet, IMAP, POP
    and SMTP perform insufficient validation of SSL certificates, which
    may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (sarge) doesn't contain ruby1.9 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch1. Updated packages for hppa and sparc will
be provided later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9 packages.</p>
