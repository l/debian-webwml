<p>
It was discovered that postfix-policyd, an anti-spam plugin for postfix,
didn't correctly bounds-test incoming SMTP commands potentially allowing
the remote exploitation of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.80-2.1etch1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this package was not present.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was fixed in version
1.80-2.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postfix-policyd package.</p>
