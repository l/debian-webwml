<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Gimp, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4519">CVE-2006-4519</a>

    <p>Sean Larsson discovered several integer overflows in the processing
    code for DICOM, PNM, PSD, RAS, XBM and XWD images, which might lead
    to the execution of arbitrary code if a user is tricked into opening
    such a malformed media file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2949">CVE-2007-2949</a>

    <p>Stefan Cornelius discovered an integer overflow in the processing
    code for PSD images, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code if a user is tricked into opening such a malformed media file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.6-1sarge4. Packages for mips and mipsel are not yet
available.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.13-1etch4. Packages for mips are not yet available.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.</p>
