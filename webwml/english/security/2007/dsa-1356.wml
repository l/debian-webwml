Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-1353">CVE-2007-1353</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that kernel memory could be leaked via the
    Bluetooth setsockopt call due to an uninitialized stack buffer. This
    could be used by local attackers to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2172">CVE-2007-2172</a>

    <p>Thomas Graf reported a typo in the DECnet protocol handler that could
    be used by a local attacker to overrun an array via crafted packets,
    potentially resulting in a Denial of Service (system crash).
    A similar issue exists in the IPV4 protocol handler and will be fixed
    in a subsequent update.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2453">CVE-2007-2453</a>

    <p>A couple of issues with random number generation were discovered.
    Slightly less random numbers resulted from hashing a subset of the
    available entropy. zero-entropy systems were seeded with the same
    inputs at boot time, resulting in repeatable series of random numbers.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2525">CVE-2007-2525</a>

    <p>Florian Zumbiehl discovered a memory leak in the PPPOE subsystem caused
    by releasing a socket before PPPIOCGCHAN is called upon it. This could
    be used by a local user to DoS a system by consuming all available memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-2876">CVE-2007-2876</a>

    <p>Vilmos Nebehaj discovered a NULL pointer dereference condition in the
    netfilter subsystem. This allows remote systems which communicate using
    the SCTP protocol to crash a system by creating a connection with an
    unknown chunk type.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3513">CVE-2007-3513</a>

    <p>Oliver Neukum reported an issue in the usblcd driver which, by not
    limiting the size of write buffers, permits local users with write access
    to trigger a DoS by consuming all available memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3642">CVE-2007-3642</a>

    <p>Zhongling Wen reported an issue in nf_conntrack_h323 where the lack of
    range checking may lead to NULL pointer dereferences. Remote attackers
    could exploit this to create a DoS condition (system crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3848">CVE-2007-3848</a>

    <p>Wojciech Purczynski discovered that pdeath_signal was not being reset
    properly under certain conditions which may allow local users to gain
    privileges by sending arbitrary signals to suid binaries.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3851">CVE-2007-3851</a>
                 
    <p>Dave Airlie reported that Intel 965 and above chipsets have relocated
    their batch buffer security bits. Local X server users may exploit this
    to write user data to arbitrary physical memory addresses.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch1.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>          <th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kerner</td>      <td>1.17+etch4</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td> <td>2.6.18-1um-2etch3</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
