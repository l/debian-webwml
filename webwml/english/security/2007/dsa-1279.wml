<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that WebCalendar, a PHP-based calendar application,
performs insufficient sanitising in the exports handler, which allows
injection of web script.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.45-4sarge7.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) no longer contains WebCalendar packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webcalendar package.</p>
