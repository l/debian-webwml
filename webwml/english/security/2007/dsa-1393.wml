<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that xfce-terminal, a terminal emulator for the xfce 
environment, did not correctly escape arguments passed to the processes
spawned by <q>Open Link</q>.  This allowed malicious links to execute arbitrary
commands upon the local system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.2.5.6rc1-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
0.2.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xfce4-terminal package.</p>
