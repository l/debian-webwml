<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that xfce-terminal, a terminal emulater for the xfce 
environment, did not correctly escape arguments passed to the processes
spawned by "Open Link".  This allowed malicious links to execute arbitary
commands upon the local system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.2.5.6rc1-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
0.2.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xfce4-terminal package.</p>
