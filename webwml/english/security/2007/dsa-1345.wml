<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xulrunner, a
runtime environment for XUL applications. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3844">CVE-2007-3844</a>

    <p><q>moz_bug_r_a4</q> discovered that a regression in the handling of
    <q>about:blank</q> windows used by addons may lead to an attacker being
    able to modify the content of web sites.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3845">CVE-2007-3845</a>

    <p>Jesper Johansson discovered that missing sanitising of double-quotes
    and spaces in URIs passed to external programs may allow an attacker
    to pass arbitrary arguments to the helper program if the user is
    tricked into opening a malformed web page.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include xulrunner.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.0.13~pre070720-0etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version
