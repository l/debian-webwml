<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>iDefense reported several integer overflow bugs in libwpd, a library
for handling WordPerfect documents.  Attackers were able to exploit
these with carefully crafted Word Perfect files that could cause an
application linked with libwpd to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libwpd package.</p>
