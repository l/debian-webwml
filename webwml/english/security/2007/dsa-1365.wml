<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nikolaus Schulz discovered that a programming error in id3lib, an ID3 Tag
Library, may lead to denial of service through symlink attacks.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-4.1sarge1.</p>

<p>Due to a technical limitation in the archive management scripts the fix
for the stable distribution (etch) can only be released in a few days.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.3-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your id3lib3.8.3 packages.</p>
