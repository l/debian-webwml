<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<p>CVE-2006-5755</p>

<p>    The NT bit maybe leaked into the next task which can local attackers
    to cause a Denial of Service (crash) on systems which run the <q>amd64</q>
    flavour kernel. The stable distribution (<q>etch</q>) was not believed to
    be vulnerable to this issue at the time of release, however Bastian
    Blank discovered that this issue still applied to the <q>xen-amd64</q> and
    <q>xen-vserver-amd64</q> flavours, and is resolved by this DSA.</p>

<p>CVE-2007-4133</p>

<p>    Hugh Dickins discovered a potential local DoS (panic) in hugetlbfs.
    A misconversion of hugetlb_vmtruncate_list to prio_tree may allow
    local users to trigger a BUG_ON() call in exit_mmap.</p>

<p>CVE-2007-4573</p>

<p>    Wojciech Purczynski discovered a vulnerability that can be exploited
    by a local user to obtain superuser privileges on x86_64 systems.
    This resulted from improper clearing of the high bits of registers
    during ia32 system call emulation. This vulnerability is relevant
    to the Debian amd64 port as well as users of the i386 port who run
    the amd64 linux-image flavour.</p>

<p>    DSA-1378 resolved this problem for the <q>amd64</q> flavour kernels, but
    Tim Wickberg and Ralf Hemmenst&auml;dt reported an outstanding issue with
    the <q>xen-amd64</q> and <q>xen-vserver-amd64</q> issues that is resolved by
    this DSA.</p>

<p>CVE-2007-5093</p>

<p>    Alex Smith discovered an issue with the pwc driver for certain webcam
    devices. If the device is removed while a userspace application has it
    open, the driver will wait for userspace to close the device, resulting
    in a blocked USB subsystem. This issue is of low security impact as
    it requires the attacker to either have physical access to the system
    or to convince a user with local access to remove the device on their
    behalf.
    
<p>
These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch4.</p>

<p>This is an update to DSA-1381-1 which included only amd64 binaries for
linux-2.6. Builds for all other architectures are now available, as well as
rebuilds of ancillary packages that make use of the included linux source.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<p>                                 Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                 1.17+etch.13etch4
     kernel-patch-openvz         028.18.1etch5
     user-mode-linux             2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch4</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot</p>
