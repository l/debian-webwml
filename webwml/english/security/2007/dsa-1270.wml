<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in
OpenOffice.org, the free office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0002">CVE-2007-0002</a>

    <p>iDefense reported several integer overflow bugs in libwpd, a
    library for handling WordPerfect documents that is included in
    OpenOffice.org.  Attackers are able to exploit these with
    carefully crafted WordPerfect files that could cause an
    application linked with libwpd to crash or possibly execute
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0238">CVE-2007-0238</a>

    <p>Next Generation Security discovered that the StarCalc parser in
    OpenOffice.org contains an easily exploitable stack overflow that
    could be used exploited by a specially crafted document to execute
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0239">CVE-2007-0239</a>

    <p>It has been reported that OpenOffice.org does not escape shell
    meta characters and is hence vulnerable to execute arbitrary shell
    commands via a specially crafted document after the user clicked
    to a prepared link.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-5etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.</p>
