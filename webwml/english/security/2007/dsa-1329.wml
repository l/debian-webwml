<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that
gfax, a GNOME frontend for fax programs, uses temporary files in an
unsafe manner which may be exploited to execute arbitrary commands
with the privileges of the root user.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed
in version 0.4.2-11sarge1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gfax package.</p>
