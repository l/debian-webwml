<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that gforge,
a collaborative development tool, used temporary files insecurely which
could allow local users to truncate files upon the system with the privileges
of the gforge user, or create a denial of service attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
4.5.14-22etch3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1-31sarge4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge package.</p>
