<p>It has been discovered that the GnuTLS certificate verification methods
implemented in libcurl-gnutls, a solid, usable, and portable multi-protocol
file transfer library, did not check for expired or invalid dates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.15.5-1etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcurl3-gnutls package.</p>
