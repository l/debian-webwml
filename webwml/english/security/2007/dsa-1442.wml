<p>
Rubert Buchholz discovered that libsndfile, a library for reading / 
writing audio files performs insufficient boundary checks when
processing FLAC files, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.
</p>

<p>
The old stable distribution (sarge) is not affected by this problem.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.16-2.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.
