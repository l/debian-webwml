<p>It was discovered that a specially-crafted packet sent to the racoon
ipsec key exchange server could cause a tunnel to crash, resulting in
a denial of service.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) isn't affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.6.6-3.1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your racoon package.</p>
