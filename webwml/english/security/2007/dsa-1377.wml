<define-tag description>null pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matthias Andree discovered that fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3, APOP 
and IMAP mail gatherer/forwarder, can under certain circumstances 
attempt to dereference a NULL pointer and crash.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), this problem was not present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.6-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.</p>
