<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that 
fireflier-server, an interactive firewall rule creation tool, uses temporary 
files in an unsafe manner which may be exploited to remove arbitary files from 
the local system.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6-3etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fireflier-server package.</p>
