<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in the processing of chat messages.
Overly long messages are truncated by the server to a fixed length,
without paying attention to the multibyte characters.  This leads to
invalid UTF-8 on clients and causes an uncaught exception.  Note that
both wesnoth and the wesnoth server are affected.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-6 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo31+1 of sarge-backports.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-2 and in version 1.2.7-1~bpo40+1 of etch-backports.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-1.</p>

<p>Packages for the oldstable mips architecture will be added to the
archive later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.</p>
