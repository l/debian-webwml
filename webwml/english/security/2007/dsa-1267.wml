<p>It was discovered that WebCalendar, a PHP-based calendar application,
insufficiently protects an internal variable, which allows remote file
inclusion.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.45-4sarge6.</p>

<p>The upcoming stable distribution (etch) no longer contains webcalendar
packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webcalendar package.</p>
