<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
Alin Rad Pop discovered that the Common UNIX Printing System is
vulnerable to an off-by-one buffer overflow in the code to process IPP
packets, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
</p>

<p>
For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4etch1. Updated packages for the arm architecure will be
provided later.
</p>

<p>
The cupsys version in the old stable distribution (sarge) is not
vulnerable to arbitrary code execution.
</p>

<p>
We recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.
