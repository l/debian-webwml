<define-tag description>arbitary shell command execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Thor Larholm discovered that libphp-phpmailer, an email transfer class
for PHP, performs insufficient input validition if configured to use
Sendmail. This allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands.
</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version 1.73-2etch1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer (1.73-2etch1) package.</p>
