<define-tag description>missing input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Thor Larholm discovered that libphp-phpmailer, an email transfer class
for PHP, performs insufficient input validition if configured to use
Sendmail. This allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (sarge) doesn't include libphp-phpmailer.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.73-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.73-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-phpmailer package.</p>
