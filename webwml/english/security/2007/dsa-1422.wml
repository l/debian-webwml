<define-tag description>integer overfows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Rafal Wojtczuk of McAfee AVERT Research discovered that e2fsprogs,
ext2 file system utilities and libraries, contained multiple
integer overflows in memory allocations, based on sizes taken directly 
from filesystem information.  These could result in heap-based
overflows potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.39+1.40-WIP-2006.11.14+dfsg-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your e2fsprogs package.</p>
