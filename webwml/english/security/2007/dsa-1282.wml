<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1286">CVE-2007-1286</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered an overflow in the object reference handling
    code of the unserialize() function, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code if malformed input is passed from an application.</p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1380">CVE-2007-1380</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered that the session handler performs
    insufficient validation of variable name length values, which allows
    information disclosure through a heap information leak.</p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1521">CVE-2007-1521</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the
    session_regenerate_id() function, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code. </p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1711">CVE-2007-1711</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered a double free vulnerability in the session
    management code, which allows the execution of arbitrary code. </p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1718">CVE-2007-1718</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered that the mail() function performs
    insufficient validation of folded mail headers, which allows mail
    header injection.</p>

<p><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1777">CVE-2007-1777</a>
    Stefan Esser discovered that the extension to handle ZIP archives
    performs insufficient length checks, which allows the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.10-20.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 4.4.4-8+etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.6-1. php4 will be removed from sid; thus you are strongly
advised to migrate to php5 if you prefer to follow the unstable
distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PHP packages. Packages for the arm,
m68k, mips and mipsel architectures are not yet available. They will be
provided later.</p>
