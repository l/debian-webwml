<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two problems were discovered with lighttpd, a fast webserver with
minimal memory footprint, which could allow denial of service.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1869">CVE-2007-1869</a>

  <p>Remote attackers could cause denial of service by disconnecting
  partway through making a request.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1870">CVE-2007-1870</a>

  <p>A NULL pointer dereference could cause a crash when serving files
  with a mtime of 0.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd package.</p>
