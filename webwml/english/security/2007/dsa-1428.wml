<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-3104">CVE-2007-3104</a>

    <p>Eric Sandeen provided a backport of Tejun Heo's fix for a local denial
    of service vulnerability in sysfs. Under memory pressure, a dentry
    structure maybe reclaimed resulting in a bad pointer dereference causing
    an oops during a readdir.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-4997">CVE-2007-4997</a>

    <p>Chris Evans discovered an issue with certain drivers that make use of the
    Linux kernel's ieee80211 layer. A remote user could generate a malicious
    802.11 frame that could result in a denial of service (crash). The ipw2100
    driver is known to be affected by this issue, while the ipw2200 is
    believed not to be.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5500">CVE-2007-5500</a>

    <p>Scott James Remnant diagnosed a coding error in the implementation of
    ptrace which could be used by a local user to cause the kernel to enter
    an infinite loop.
    
These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch5.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

                                 <p>Debian 4.0 (etch)
     fai-kernels                 1.17+etch.13etch5
     user-mode-linux             2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch5</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
