<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>gpdf includes a copy of the xpdf code and requires an update as well.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge6.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) no longer contains gpdf.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains gpdf.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf packages.</p>
