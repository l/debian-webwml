<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>libextractor includes a copy of the xpdf code and required an update
as well.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge6.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (etch) isn't affected by this problem.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) isn't affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor packages.</p>
