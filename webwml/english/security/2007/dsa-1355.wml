<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the xpdf PDF viewer may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>kpdf includes a copy of the xpdf code and required an update as well.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-2sarge5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-3etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.7-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf packages.</p>
