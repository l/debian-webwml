<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6058">CVE-2006-6058</a>

    <p>LMH reported an issue in the minix filesystem that allows local users
    with mount privileges to create a DoS (printk flood) by mounting a
    specially crafted corrupt filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5966">CVE-2007-5966</a>

    <p>Warren Togami discovered an issue in the hrtimer subsystem that allows
    a local user to cause a DoS (soft lockup) by requesting a timer sleep
    for a long period of time leading to an integer overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6063">CVE-2007-6063</a>

    <p>Venustech AD-LAB discovered a buffer overflow in the isdn ioctl
    handling, exploitable by a local user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6206">CVE-2007-6206</a>

    <p>Blake Frantz discovered that when a core file owned by a non-root user
    exists, and a root-owned process dumps core over it, the core file
    retains its original ownership. This could be used by a local user to
    gain access to sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-6417">CVE-2007-6417</a>

    <p>Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the tmpfs filesystem where, under
    a rare circumstance, a kernel page may be improperly cleared, leaking
    sensitive kernel memory to userspace or resulting in a DoS (crash).</p></li>
    
</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in the stable distribution in version 
2.6.18.dfsg.1-13etch6.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>                  <th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>             <td>1.17+etch.13etch6</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td>         <td>2.6.18-1um-2etch.13etch6</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
