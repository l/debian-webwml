<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>This update fixes all currently known regressions introduced with
the previous two revisions of DSA-1409.
The original text is reproduced below:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Several local/remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in samba,
a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5398">CVE-2007-5398</a>

   <p>Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly
   check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS
   server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting
   in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4572">CVE-2007-4572</a>
   <p>Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer
   during the processing of GETDC logon server requests.  When samba is
   configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker
   could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of
   service.</p>
</li>

</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>For the old stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14a-3sarge10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.24-6etch8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.27-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
