<define-tag description>missing input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that in lftp, a command-line HTTP/FTP client, there is
no proper validation of the filename provided by the server through the
Content-Disposition header; attackers can use this flaw by suggesting a
filename they wish to overwrite on the client machine, and then possibly
execute arbitrary code (for instance if the attacker elects to write a
dotfile in a home directory).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.3-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lftp packages.</p>
