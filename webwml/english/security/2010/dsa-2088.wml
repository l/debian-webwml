<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that wget, a command line tool for downloading files
from the WWW, uses server-provided file names when creating local
files.  This may lead to code execution in some scenarios.</p>

<p>After this update, wget will ignore server-provided file names.  You
can restore the old behavior in cases where it is not desirable by
invoking wget with the new --use-server-file-name option.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.4-2+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wget package.</p>
