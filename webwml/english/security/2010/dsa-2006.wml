<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo, a program
designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0426">CVE-2010-0426</a>

<p>It was discovered that sudo when a pseudo-command is enabled, permits a
match between the name of the pseudo-command and the name of an
executable file in an arbitrary directory, which allows local users to
gain privileges via a crafted executable file.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0427">CVE-2010-0427</a>

<p>It was discovered that sudo when the runas_default option is used, does
not properly set group memberships, which allows local users to gain privileges
via a sudo command.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9p17-2+lenny1</p>

<p>For the  unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.2p1-1.2, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.</p>
