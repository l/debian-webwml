<p>Jukka Taimisto, Tero Rontti and Rauli Kaksonen discovered that the embedded Expat copy
in the interpreter for the Python language, does not properly process malformed or
crafted XML files. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3560">CVE-2009-3560</a> <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3720">CVE-2009-3720</a>)
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service while parsing
a malformed XML file.</p>

<p>In addition, this update fixes an integer overflow in the hashlib module in python2.5.
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to defeat cryptographic digests. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2316">CVE-2008-2316</a>)
It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.4-3+etch3 for python2.4 and version 2.5-5+etch2 for python2.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-1+lenny1 for python2.4 and version 2.5.2-15+lenny1 for python2.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.4-3.1 for python2.5, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.
python2.4 has been removed from the testing distribution (squeeze), and it will
be removed from the unstable distribution soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python packages.</p>
