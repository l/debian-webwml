<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in BIND, an
implementation of the DNS protocol suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3762">CVE-2010-3762</a>
	<p>When DNSSEC validation is enabled, BIND does not properly
	handle certain bad signatures if multiple trust anchors exist
	for a single zone, which allows remote attackers to cause a
	denial of service (server crash) via a DNS query.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3614">CVE-2010-3614</a>
	<p>BIND does not properly determine the security status of an NS
	RRset during a DNSKEY algorithm rollover, which may lead to
	zone unavailability during rollovers.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3613">CVE-2010-3613</a>
	<p>BIND does not properly handle the combination of signed
	negative responses and corresponding RRSIG records in the
	cache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
	service (server crash) via a query for cached data.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, this security update improves compatibility with
previously installed versions of the bind9 package.  As a result, it
is necessary to initiate the update with "apt-get dist-upgrade"
instead of "apt-get update".</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.6.ESV.R3+dfsg-0+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
1:9.7.2.dfsg.P3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
