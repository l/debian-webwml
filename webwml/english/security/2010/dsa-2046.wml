<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpgroupware, a
Web based groupware system written in PHP. The Common Vulnerabilities 
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0403">CVE-2010-0403</a>

<p>A local file inclusion vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary PHP code and include arbitrary local files.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0404">CVE-2010-0404</a> 

<p>Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities allows remote attackers to execute
arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.9.16.012+dfsg-8+lenny2</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpgroupware package.</p>
