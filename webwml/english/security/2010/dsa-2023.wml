<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Wesley Miaw discovered that libcurl, a multi-protocol file transfer
library, is prone to a buffer overflow via the callback function when
an application relies on libcurl to automatically uncompress data. Note
that this only affects applications that trust libcurl's maximum limit
for a fixed buffer size and do not perform any sanity checks themselves.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.18.2-8lenny4.</p>

<p>Due to a problem with the archive software, we are unable to release all
architectures simultaneously. Binaries for the hppa, ia64, mips, mipsel
and s390 architectures will be provided once they are available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 7.20.0-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
