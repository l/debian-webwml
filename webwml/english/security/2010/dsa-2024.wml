<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Jamie Strandboge discovered that moin, a python clone of WikiWiki, does
not sufficiently sanitize the page name in "Despam" action, allowing remote
attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>

<p>In addition, this update fixes a minor issue in the "textcha" protection, it
could be trivially bypassed by blanking the "textcha-question" and "textcha-answer"
form fields.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.1-3+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these problems
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your moin package.</p>
