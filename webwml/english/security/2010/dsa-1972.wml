<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Kellermann discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the handling
of ADPCM WAV files in libaudiofile. This flaw could result in a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly execution of arbitrary code
via a crafted WAV file.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in
version 0.2.6-6+etch1.</p>

<p>The packages for the oldstable distribution are not included in this
advisory. An update will be released soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.6-7+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.6-7.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your audiofile packages.</p>
