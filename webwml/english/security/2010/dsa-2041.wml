<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that mediawiki, a website engine for collaborative
work, is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery login attack, which
could be used to conduct phishing or similar attacks to users via
affected mediawiki installations.</p>

<p>Note that the fix used breaks the login API and may require clients using it to 
be updated.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.12.0-2lenny5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1:1.15.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.</p>
