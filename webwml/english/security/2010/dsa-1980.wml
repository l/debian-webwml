<define-tag description>integer underflow/denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>David Leadbeater discovered an integer underflow that could be triggered
via the LINKS command and can lead to a denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4016">CVE-2009-4016</a>). This issue affects both,
ircd-hybrid and ircd-ratbox.</p>

<p>It was discovered that the ratbox IRC server is prone to a denial of
service attack via the HELP command. The ircd-hybrid package is not
vulnerable to this issue (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0300">CVE-2010-0300</a>).</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:7.2.2.dfsg.2-4+lenny1 of the ircd-hybrid package and in
version 2.2.8.dfsg-2+lenny1 of ircd-ratbox.</p>

<p>Due to a bug in the archive software it was not possible to release the
fix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. The packages
will be released as version 7.2.2.dfsg.2-3+etch1 once they become
available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ircd-hybrid/ircd-ratbox packages.</p>
