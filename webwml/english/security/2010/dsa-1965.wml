<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that phpLDAPadmin, a web based interface for administering
LDAP servers, doesn't sanitize an internal variable, which allows remote
attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.0.5-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.0.7-1.1</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin package.</p>
