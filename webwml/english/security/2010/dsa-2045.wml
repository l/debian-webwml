<p>Bob Clary, Dan Kaminsky and David Keeler discovered that in libtheora, a
video library part of the Ogg project, several flaws allow 
context-dependent attackers via a large and specially crafted media
file, to cause a denial of service (crash of the player using this
library), and possibly arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0~beta3-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtheora packages.</p>
