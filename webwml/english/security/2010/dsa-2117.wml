<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>APR-util is part of the Apache Portable Runtime library which is used
by projects such as Apache httpd and Subversion.</p>

<p>Jeff Trawick discovered a flaw in the apr_brigade_split_line() function
in apr-util. A remote attacker could send crafted http requests to
cause a greatly increased memory consumption in Apache httpd, resulting
in a denial of service.</p>

<p>This upgrade fixes this issue. After the upgrade, any running apache2
server processes need to be restarted.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.9+dfsg-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apr-util packages.</p>
