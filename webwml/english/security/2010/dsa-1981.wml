<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Christoph Anton Mitterer discovered that maildrop, a mail delivery agent
with filtering abilities, is prone to a privilege escalation issue that
grants a user root group privileges.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-11+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your maildrop packages.</p>
