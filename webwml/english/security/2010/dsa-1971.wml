<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Tim Starling discovered that libthai, a set of Thai language support routines,
is vulnerable of integer/heap overflow.
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to run arbitrary code by sending a very
long string.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.6-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.9-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libthai package.</p>
