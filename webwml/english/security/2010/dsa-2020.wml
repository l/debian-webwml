<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivan Shmakov discovered that the htmlscrubber component of ikiwiki, a wiki
compiler, performs insufficient input sanitization on data:image/svg+xml
URIs.  As these can contain script code this can be used by an attacker
to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.53.5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20100312.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20100312.</p>
