<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities (SA-CORE-2010-001) have been discovered in
drupal6, a fully-featured content management framework.</p>


<h3>Installation cross site scripting</h3>

<p>A user-supplied value is directly output during installation allowing a
malicious user to craft a URL and perform a cross-site scripting attack.
The exploit can only be conducted on sites not yet installed.</p>


<h3>Open redirection</h3>

<p>The API function drupal_goto() is susceptible to a phishing attack.
An attacker could formulate a redirect in a way that gets the Drupal site
to send the user to an arbitrarily provided URL.
No user submitted data will be sent to that URL.</p>


<h3>Locale module cross site scripting</h3>

<p>Locale module and dependent contributed modules do not sanitize the display
of language codes, native and English language names properly.
While these usually come from a preselected list, arbitrary administrator
input is allowed.
This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that the attacker must have a
role with the 'administer languages' permission.</p>


<h3>Blocked user session regeneration</h3>

<p>Under certain circumstances, a user with an open session that is blocked
can maintain his/her session on the Drupal site, despite being blocked.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.6-3lenny5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.16-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 package.</p>
