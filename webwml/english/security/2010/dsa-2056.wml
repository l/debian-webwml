<define-tag description>missing input sanitizing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that in zonecheck, a tool to check DNS configurations,
the CGI does not perform sufficient sanitation of user input; an
attacker can take advantage of this and pass script code in order to
perform cross-site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-13lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zonecheck packages.</p>
