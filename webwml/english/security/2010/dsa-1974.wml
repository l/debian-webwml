<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in gzip, the GNU compression
utilities. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2624">CVE-2009-2624</a>

<p>Thiemo Nagel discovered a missing input sanitation flaw in the way gzip
used to decompress data blocks for dynamic Huffman codes, which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code when trying to decompress a
crafted archive. This issue is a reappearance of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4334">CVE-2006-4334</a> and only
affects the lenny version.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0001">CVE-2010-0001</a>

<p>Aki Helin discovered an integer underflow when decompressing files that
are compressed using the LZW algorithm. This could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code when trying to decompress a crafted LZW compressed
gzip archive.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.12-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-15+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gzip packages.</p>
