<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that pmount, a wrapper around the standard mount
program which permits normal users to mount removable devices without a
matching /etc/fstab entry, creates files in /var/lock insecurely.
A local attacker could overwrite arbitrary files utilising a symlink attack.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.18-2+lenny1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.23-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pmount package.</p>
