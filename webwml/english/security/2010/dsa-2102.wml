<define-tag description>unchecked return value</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that in barnowl, a curses-based instant-messaging
client, the return codes of calls to the ZPending and ZReceiveNotice
functions in libzephyr were not checked, allowing attackers to cause a
denial of service (crash of the application), and possibly execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your barnowl packages.</p>
