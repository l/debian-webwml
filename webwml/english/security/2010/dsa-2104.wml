<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the BGP
implementation of Quagga, a routing daemon.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2948">CVE-2010-2948</a>
	<p>When processing a crafted Route Refresh message received
	from a configured, authenticated BGP neighbor, Quagga
	may crash, leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2949">CVE-2010-2949</a>
  <p>When processing certain crafted AS paths, Quagga would crash
	with a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a denial of
	service.  In some configurations, such crafted AS paths could
	be relayed by intermediate BGP routers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, this update contains a reliability fix:  Quagga will no
longer advertise confederation-related AS paths to non-confederation
peers, and reject unexpected confederation-related AS paths by
resetting the session with the BGP peer which is advertising them.
(Previously, such AS paths would trigger resets of unrelated BGP
sessions.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.10-1lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.</p>
