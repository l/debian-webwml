<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in ffmpeg, a multimedia 
player, server and encoder, which also provides a range of multimedia
libraries used in applications like MPlayer:</p>

<p>Various programming errors in container and codec implementations
may lead to denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code
if the user is tricked into opening a malformed media file or stream.</p>

<p>Affected and updated have been the implementations of the following
codecs and container formats:</p>

<ul>
<li>the Vorbis audio codec</li>
<li>the Ogg container implementation</li>
<li>the FF Video 1 codec</li>
<li>the MPEG audio codec</li>
<li>the H264 video codec</li>
<li>the MOV container implementation</li>
<li>the Oggedc container implementation</li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.svn20080206-18+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:0.5+svn20090706-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
