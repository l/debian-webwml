<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP&nbsp;5, an hypertext
preprocessor.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1917">CVE-2010-1917</a>

    <p>The fnmatch function can be abused to conduct denial of service attacks
    (by crashing the interpreter) by the means of a stack overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2225">CVE-2010-2225</a>

    <p>The SplObjectStorage unserializer allows attackers to execute arbitrary
    code via serialized data by the means of a use-after-free
    vulnerability.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3065">CVE-2010-3065</a>

    <p>The default sessions serializer does not correctly handle a special
    marker, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary variables into the
    session and possibly exploit vulnerabilities in the unserializer.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1128">CVE-2010-1128</a>

    <p>For this vulnerability (predictable entropy for the Linear Congruential
    Generator used to generate session ids) we do not consider upstream's
    solution to be sufficient.  It is recommended to uncomment the
    <q>session.entropy_file</q> and <q>session.entropy_length</q> settings in the php.ini
    files.  Further improvements can be achieved by setting
    <q>session.hash_function</q> to 1 (one) and incrementing the value of
    <q>session.entropy_length</q>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
