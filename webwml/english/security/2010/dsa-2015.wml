<p>A local vulnerability has been discovered in drbd8.</p>

<p>Philipp Reisner fixed an issue in the drbd kernel module that allows
local users to send netlink packets to perform actions that should be
restricted to users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN privileges. This is a similar
issue to those described by <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3725">CVE-2009-3725</a>.</p>

<p>This update also fixes an ABI compatibility issue which was introduced
by linux-2.6 (2.6.26-21lenny3). The prebuilt drbd module packages listed
in this advisory require a linux-image package version 2.6.26-21lenny3
or greater.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
drbd8 (2:8.0.14-2+lenny1).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drbd8 packages.</p>

<p>The linux-modules-extra-2.6 package has been rebuilt against the updated
drbd8 package to provide fixed prebuilt drbd8-modules packages. If,
instead of using the prebuilt drbd8-modules packages, you have built and
installed a local copy of the drbd module from the drbd8-source package
(e.g., using module-assistant), you will need to follow the same steps
you originally used to rebuild your module after upgrading the
drbd8-source package.</p>

<p>Note: After upgrading a kernel module you must reload the module
for the changes to take effect:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Shutdown all services that make use of the drbd module</li>
 <li>Unload the previous drbd module (modprobe -r drbd)</li>
 <li>Load the updated drbd module (modprobe drbd)</li>
 <li>Restart any services that make use of the drbd module</li>
</ol>

<p>A system reboot will also cause the updated module to be used.</p>
