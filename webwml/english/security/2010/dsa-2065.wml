<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security issues have been discovered in the DCC protocol support
code of kvirc, a KDE-based next generation IRC client, which allow
the overwriting of local files through directory traversal and the
execution of arbitrary code through a format string attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.0-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.0~svn4340+rc3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvirc packages.</p>
