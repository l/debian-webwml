<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tim Bunce discovered that PostgreSQL, a database server software, does
not properly separate interpreters for server-side stored procedures
which run in different security contexts. As a result, non-privileged
authenticated database users might gain additional privileges.</p>

<p>Note that this security update may impact intended communication through
global variables between stored procedures.  It might be necessary to
convert these functions to run under the plperlu or pltclu languages,
with database superuser privileges.</p>

<p>This security update also includes unrelated bug fixes from PostgreSQL
8.3.12.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3_8.3.12-0lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.5-1 of the postgresql-8.4 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.</p>
