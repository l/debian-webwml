<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in polipo, a
small, caching web proxy. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3305">CVE-2009-3305</a>

    <p>A malicous remote sever could cause polipo to crash by sending an
    invalid Cache-Control header.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4143">CVE-2009-4143</a>

    <p>A malicous client could cause polipo to crash by sending a large
    Content-Length value.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This upgrade also fixes some other bugs that could lead to a daemon crash
or an infinite loop and may be triggerable remotely.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.4-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polipo packages.</p>
