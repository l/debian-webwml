<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that libxerces2-java, a validating XML parser for Java,
does not properly process malformed XML files.
This vulnerability could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service while parsing
a malformed XML file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.1-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.1-4.1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxerces2-java package.</p>
