<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security issues have been discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL
PostScript/PDF interpreter. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4897">CVE-2009-4897</a>

  <p>A buffer overflow was discovered that allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service via a crafted PDF
  document containing a long name.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1628">CVE-2010-1628</a>

  <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that ghostscript incorrectly handled certain
  recursive Postscript files. An attacker could execute arbitrary code
  via a PostScript file containing unlimited recursive procedure
  invocations, which trigger memory corruption in the stack of the
  interpreter.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.62.dfsg.1-3.2lenny5</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 8.71~dfsg2-4</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript package.</p>
