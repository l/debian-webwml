<define-tag description>null pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Shawn Emery discovered that in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5), a system for
authenticating users and services on a network, a null pointer
dereference flaw in the Generic Security Service Application Program
Interface (GSS-API) library could allow an authenticated remote attacker
to crash any server application using the GSS-API authentication
mechanism, by sending a specially-crafted GSS-API token with a missing
checksum field.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.1+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.1+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
