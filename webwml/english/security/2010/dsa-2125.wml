<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw has been found in the OpenSSL TLS server extension code parsing
which on affected servers can be exploited in a buffer overrun attack.
This allows an attacker to cause an appliation crash or potentially to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>However, not all OpenSSL based SSL/TLS servers are vulnerable: A server
is vulnerable if it is multi-threaded and uses OpenSSL's internal caching
mechanism.  In particular the Apache HTTP server (which never uses OpenSSL
internal caching) and Stunnel (which includes its own workaround) are NOT
affected.</p>

<p>This upgrade fixes this issue. After the upgrade, any services using the
openssl libraries need to be restarted. The checkrestart script from the
debian-goodies package or lsof can help to find out which services need
to be restarted.</p>

<p>A note to users of the tor packages from the Debian backports or Debian
volatile: This openssl update causes problems with some versions of tor.
You need to update to tor 0.2.1.26-4~bpo50+1 or 0.2.1.26-1~lennyvolatile2,
respectively. The tor package version 0.2.0.35-1~lenny2 from Debian stable
is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
openssl version 0.9.8g-15+lenny9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.9.8o-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
