<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4329">CVE-2010-4329</a>

  <p>Cross site scripting was possible in search, that allowed
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4480">CVE-2010-4480</a>

  <p>Cross site scripting was possible in errors, that allowed
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4481">CVE-2010-4481</a>

  <p>Display of PHP's phpinfo() function was available to world, but only
  if this functionality had been enabled (defaults to off). This may
  leak some information about the host system.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 3.3.7-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
