<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1169">CVE-2010-1169</a>

    <p>Tim Bunce discovered that the implementation of the procedural
    language PL/Perl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed
    code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary
    Perl code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1170">CVE-2010-1170</a>

    <p>Tom Lane discovered that the implementation of the procedural
    language PL/Tcl insufficiently restricts the subset of allowed
    code, which allows authenticated users the execution of arbitrary
    Tcl code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-1975">CVE-2010-1975</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an unprivileged user could reset
    superuser-only parameter settings.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.3.11-0lenny1. This update also introduces a fix for 
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0442">CVE-2010-0442</a>, which was originally scheduled for the next Lenny point
update.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.4.4-1 of postgresql-8.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.3 packages.</p>
