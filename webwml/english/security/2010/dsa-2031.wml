<p>Sol Jerome discovered that kadmind service in krb5, a system for authenticating
users and services on a network, allows remote authenticated users to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via a request from a kadmin client that sends
an invalid API version number.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny3.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid) are
not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.</p>
