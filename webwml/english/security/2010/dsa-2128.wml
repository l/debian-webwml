<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bui Quang Minh discovered that libxml2, a library for parsing and
handling XML data files, does not well process a malformed XPATH,
causing crash and allowing arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32.dfsg-5+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
has been fixed in version 2.7.8.dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 package.</p>
