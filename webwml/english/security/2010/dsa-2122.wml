<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ben Hawkes and Tavis Ormandy discovered that the dynamic loader in GNU
libc allows local users to gain root privileges using a crafted
LD_AUDIT environment variable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny6.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.11.2-6+squeeze1 of the eglibc package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your glibc packages.</p>
