<p>Two issues have been found in the Apache HTTPD web server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0408">CVE-2010-0408</a>

<p>mod_proxy_ajp would return the wrong status code if it encountered an
error, causing a backend server to be put into an error state until the
retry timeout expired. A remote attacker could send malicious requests
to trigger this issue, resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0434">CVE-2010-0434</a>

<p>A flaw in the core subrequest process code was found, which could lead
to a daemon crash (segfault) or disclosure of sensitive information
if the headers of a subrequest were modified by modules such as
mod_headers.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.9-10+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.2.15-1.</p>

<p>This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which
have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 and apache2-mpm-itk packages.</p>
