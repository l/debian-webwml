<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that in squidguard, a URL redirector/filter/ACL plugin
for squid, several problems in src/sgLog.c and src/sgDiv.c allow remote
users to either:</p>

<ul>

  <li>cause a denial of service, by requesting long URLs containing many
  slashes; this forces the daemon into emergency mode, where it does not
  process requests anymore.</li>

  <li>bypass rules by requesting URLs whose length is close to predefined
  buffer limits, in this case 2048 for squidguard and 4096 or 8192 for squid
  (depending on its version).</li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-8.4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squidguard package.</p>
