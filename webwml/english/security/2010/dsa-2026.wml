<define-tag description>stack-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Marc Schoenefeld discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the XPM reader
implementation in netpbm-free, a suite of image manipulation utilities.
An attacker could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code via an XPM image file that contains a crafted header
field associated with a large color index value.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:10.0-12+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:10.0-12.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>Due to a problem with the archive system it is not possible to release
all architectures. The missing architectures will be installed into the
archive once they become available.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm-free package.</p>
