<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Phil Oester discovered that squid3, a fully featured Web Proxy cache, is
prone to a denial of service attack via a specially crafted request that
includes empty strings.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.STABLE8-3+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
