<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in
squid and squid3, a web proxy. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2855">CVE-2009-2855</a>

<p>Bastian Blank discovered that it is possible to cause a denial of
service via a crafted auth header with certain comma delimiters.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0308">CVE-2010-0308</a>

<p>Tomas Hoger discovered that it is possible to cause a denial of service
via invalid DNS header-only packets.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.STABLE3-4.1lenny1 of the squid package and version
3.0.STABLE8-3+lenny3 of the squid3 package.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.5-6etch5 of the squid package and version 3.0.PRE5-5+etch2
of the squid3 package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid/squid3 packages.</p>
