<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Charlie Miller has discovered two vulnerabilities in OpenOffice.org
Impress, which can be exploited by malicious people to compromise a
user's system and execute arbitrary code.</p>

<ul>

   <li><p>An integer truncation error when parsing certain content can be
   exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
   crafted file.</p></li>

   <li><p>A short integer overflow error when parsing certain content can
   be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially
   crafted file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny8.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions these
problems have been fixed in version 3.2.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
