<define-tag description>integer underflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aki Helin discovered an integer underflow in ncompress, the original
Lempel-Ziv compress/uncompress programs.
This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code when trying to decompress
a crafted LZW compressed gzip archive.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4.2-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this
problem has been fixed in version 4.2.4.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ncompress package.</p>
