<p>Alasdair Kergon discovered that the cluster logical volume manager daemon
(clvmd) in LVM2, The Linux Logical Volume Manager, does not verify client
credentials upon a socket connection, which allows local users to cause a
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.02.39-8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 2.02.66-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lvm2 package.</p>
