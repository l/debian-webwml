<define-tag description>integer underflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that krb5, a system for authenticating users and services on a
network, is prone to integer underflow in the AES and RC4 decryption operations of
the crypto library. A remote attacker can cause crashes, heap corruption, or,
under extraordinarily unlikely conditions, arbitrary code execution.</p>


<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7etch8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8+dfsg~alpha1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 package.</p>
