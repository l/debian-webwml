<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU C Library (aka
glibc) and its derivatives. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures 
project identifies the following problems:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1391">CVE-2008-1391</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4880">CVE-2009-4880</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4881">CVE-2009-4881</a>

    <p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not
    correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon family of 
    functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into 
    processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker 
    could crash applications, leading to a denial of service.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0296">CVE-2010-0296</a>

    <p>Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did
    not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If
    a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry 
    through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the 
    system or possibly gain root privileges.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0830">CVE-2010-0830</a>

    <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly
    validate certain ELF program headers.  If a user or automated system
    were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a 
    remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7-18lenny4 of the glibc package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems has been fixed in
version 2.1.11-1 of the eglibc package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your glibc or eglibc packages.</p>
