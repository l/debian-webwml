<define-tag description>macro execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that OpenOffice.org, a full-featured office productivity
suite that provides a near drop-in replacement for Microsoft&reg; Office, is
not properly handling python macros embedded in an office document.  This
allows an attacker to perform user-assisted execution of arbitrary code in
certain use cases of the python macro viewer component.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
