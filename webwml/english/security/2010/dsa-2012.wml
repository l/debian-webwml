<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3725">CVE-2009-3725</a>

    <p>Philipp Reisner reported an issue in the connector subsystem
    which allows unprivileged users to send netlink packets. This
    allows local users to manipulate settings for uvesafb devices
    which are normally reserved for privileged users.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0622">CVE-2010-0622</a>

    <p>Jermome Marchand reported an issue in the futex subsystem that
    allows a local user to force an invalid futex state which results
    in a denial of service (oops).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also includes fixes for regressions introduced by previous
updates. See the referenced Debian bug pages for details.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-21lenny4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were
rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
