<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in kvm, a full
virtualization system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0298">CVE-2010-0298</a> &amp; <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0306">CVE-2010-0306</a>

    <p>Gleb Natapov discovered issues in the KVM subsystem where missing
    permission checks (CPL/IOPL) permit a user in a guest system to
    denial of service a guest (system crash) or gain escalated
    privileges with the guest.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0309">CVE-2010-0309</a>

    <p>Marcelo Tosatti fixed an issue in the PIT emulation code in the
    KVM subsystem that allows privileged users in a guest domain to
    cause a denial of service (crash) of the host system.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-0419">CVE-2010-0419</a>

    <p>Paolo Bonzini found a bug in KVM that can be used to bypass proper
    permission checking while loading segment selectors. This
    potentially allows privileged guest users to execute privileged
    instructions on the host system.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 72+dfsg-5~lenny5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be addressed within the linux-2.6 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvm package.</p>
