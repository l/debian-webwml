<define-tag description>path traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>William Grant discovered that the dpkg-source component of dpkg, the
low-level infrastructure for handling the installation and removal of
Debian software packages, is vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
A specially crafted Debian source package can lead to file modification
outside of the destination directory when extracting the package content.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14.29.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
