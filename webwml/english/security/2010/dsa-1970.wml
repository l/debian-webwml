<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a significant memory leak could occur in OpenSSL,
related to the reinitialization of zlib. This could result in a remotely
exploitable denial of service vulnerability when using the Apache httpd
server in a configuration where mod_ssl, mod_php5, and the php5-curl
extension are loaded.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny6.</p>

<p>The packages for the arm architecture are not included in this advisory.
They will be released as soon as they become available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon. The issue does not seem to be
exploitable with the apache2 package contained in squeeze/sid.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages. You also need to
restart your Apache httpd server to make sure it uses the updated
libraries.</p>
