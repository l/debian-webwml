<define-tag description>missing input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jeremy James discovered that in LDAPUserFolder, a Zope extension
used to authenticate against an LDAP server, the authentication code
does not verify the password provided for the emergency user. Malicious
users that manage to get the emergency user login can use this flaw to
gain administrative access to the Zope instance, by providing an
arbitrary password.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>The package no longer exists in the upcoming stable distribution
(squeeze) or the unstable distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zope-ldapuserfolder package.</p>
