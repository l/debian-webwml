<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Anders Kaseorg and Evan Broder discovered a vulnerability in sudo, a
program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to
users, that allows a user with sudo permissions on certain programs to
use those programs with an untrusted value of PATH.
This could possibly lead to certain intended restrictions being bypassed,
such as the secure_path setting.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.9p17-3</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.2p7-1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.</p>
