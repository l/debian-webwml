<define-tag description>sql injection</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that otrs2, the Open Ticket Request System, does not
properly sanitise input data that is used on SQL queries, which might be
used to inject arbitrary SQL to, for example, escalate privileges on a
system that uses otrs2.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.7-2lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), the problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), the problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.</p>
