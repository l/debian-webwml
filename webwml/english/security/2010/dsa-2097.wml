<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3055">CVE-2010-3055</a>

  <p>The configuration setup script does not properly sanitise its output
  file, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via
  a crafted POST request. In Debian, the setup tool is protected through
  Apache HTTP basic authentication by default.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3056">CVE-2010-3056</a>

  <p>Various cross site scripting issues have been discovered that allow
  a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid), these problems
have been fixed in version 3.3.5.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
