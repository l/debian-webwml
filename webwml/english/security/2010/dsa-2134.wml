<define-tag description>upcoming changes in advisory format</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Traditionally Debian Security Advisories have included MD5 check sums
of the updated packages. This was introduced at a time when apt didn't
exist yet and BIND was at version 4.</p>

<p>Since apt cryptographically enforces the integrity of the archive for
quite some time now, we've decided to finally drop the hash values
from our advisory mails.</p>

<p>We'll also change some details of the advisory format in the upcoming
months.</p>
