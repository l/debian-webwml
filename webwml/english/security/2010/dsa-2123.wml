<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Mozilla's Network
Security Services (NSS) library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3170">CVE-2010-3170</a>
	<p>NSS recognizes a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common
	Name field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow
	man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via
	a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
	Authority.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3173">CVE-2010-3173</a>
	<p>NSS does not properly set the minimum key length for
	Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral (DHE) mode, which makes it easier for
	remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms
	via a brute-force attack.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
3.12.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your NSS packages.</p>
