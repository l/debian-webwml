<define-tag description>incorrect user-input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A stack overflow vulnerability was found in socat that allows an 
attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the socat
process.</p>

<p>This vulnerability can only be exploited when an attacker is able to 
inject more than 512 bytes of data into socat's argument.</p>

<p>A vulnerable scenario would be a CGI script that reads data from 
clients and uses (parts of) this data as argument for a socat 
invocation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in 
version 1.6.0.1-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.1.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your socat package.</p>
