<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>tixxDZ (DZCORE labs) discovered a vulnerability in vlc, the multimedia
player and streamer.  Missing data validation in vlc's real data transport
(RDT) implementation enable an integer underflow and consequently an
unbounded buffer operation.  A maliciously crafted stream could thus enable
an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>No Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifier is available for
this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
0.8.6.h-4+lenny2.3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem was fixed in version
1.0.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
