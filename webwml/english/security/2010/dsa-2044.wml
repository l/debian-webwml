<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>tixxDZ (DZCORE labs) discovered a vulnerability in the mplayer movie
player.  Missing data validation in mplayer's real data transport (RDT)
implementation enable an integer underflow and consequently an unbounded
buffer operation.  A maliciously crafted stream could thus enable an
attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>No Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifier is available for
this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
1.0~rc2-17+lenny3.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mplayer packages.</p>
