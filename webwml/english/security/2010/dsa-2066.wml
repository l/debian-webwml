<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer. It was discovered that null pointer
dereferences, buffer overflows and infinite loops in the SMB, SMB
PIPE, ASN1.1 and SigComp dissectors could lead to denial of service
or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny9.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable 
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 
1.2.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.</p>
