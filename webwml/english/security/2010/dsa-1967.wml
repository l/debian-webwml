<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that Transmission, a lightwight client for
the Bittorrent filesharing protocol, performs insufficient sanitising
of file names specified in .torrent files. This could lead to the
overwrite of local files with the privileges of the user running
Transmission if the user is tricked into opening a malicious torrent
file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.22-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.77-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your transmission packages.</p>
