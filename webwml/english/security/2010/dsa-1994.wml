<define-tag description>weak session IDs</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Ajaxterm, a web-based terminal, generates weak
and predictable session IDs, which might be used to hijack a session or
cause a denial of service attack on a system that uses Ajaxterm.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), the problem has been fixed in
version 0.9-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), the problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ajaxterm package.</p>
