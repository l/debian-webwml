<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in aria2, a download client. The "name"
attribute of the "file" element of metalink files is not properly
sanitised before using it to download files. If a user is tricked into
downloading from a specially crafted metalink file, this can be
exploited to download files to directories outside of the intended
download directory.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14.0-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your aria2 package.</p>
