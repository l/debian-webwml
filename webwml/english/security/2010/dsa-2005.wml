<p>NOTE: This kernel update marks the final planned kernel security
update for the 2.6.24 kernel in the Debian release 'etch'.  Although
security support for 'etch' officially ended on Feburary 15th, 2010,
this update was already in preparation before that date.</p>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege
escalation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2691">CVE-2009-2691</a>

    <p>Steve Beattie and Kees Cook reported an information leak in the
    maps and smaps files available under /proc. Local users may be
    able to read this data for setuid processes while the ELF binary
    is being loaded.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2695">CVE-2009-2695</a>

    <p>Eric Paris provided several fixes to increase the protection
    provided by the mmap_min_addr tunable against NULL pointer
    dereference vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3080">CVE-2009-3080</a>

    <p>Dave Jones reported an issue in the gdth SCSI driver. A missing
    check for negative offsets in an ioctl call could be exploited by
    local users to create a denial of service or potentially gain
    elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3726">CVE-2009-3726</a>

    <p>Trond Myklebust reported an issue where a malicious NFS server
    could cause a denial of service condition on its clients by
    returning incorrect attributes during an open call.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3889">CVE-2009-3889</a>

    <p>Joe Malicki discovered an issue in the megaraid_sas driver.
    Insufficient permissions on the sysfs dbg_lvl interface allow
    local users to modify the debug logging behavior.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4005">CVE-2009-4005</a>

    <p>Roel Kluin discovered an issue in the hfc_usb driver, an ISDN
    driver for Colognechip HFC-S USB chip. A potential read overflow
    exists which may allow remote users to cause a denial of service
    condition (oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4020">CVE-2009-4020</a>

    <p>Amerigo Wang discovered an issue in the HFS filesystem that would
    allow a denial of service by a local user who has sufficient
    privileges to mount a specially crafted filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4021">CVE-2009-4021</a>

    <p>Anana V. Avati discovered an issue in the fuse subsystem. If the
    system is sufficiently low on memory, a local user can cause the
    kernel to dereference an invalid pointer resulting in a denial of
    service (oops) and potentially an escalation of privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4138">CVE-2009-4138</a>

    <p>Jay Fenlason discovered an issue in the firewire stack that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (oops or crash) by making
    a specially crafted ioctl call.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4308">CVE-2009-4308</a>

    <p>Ted Ts'o discovered an issue in the ext4 filesystem that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference).  For this to be exploitable, the local user must
    have sufficient privileges to mount a filesystem.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4536">CVE-2009-4536</a>
    <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4538">CVE-2009-4538</a>

    <p>Fabian Yamaguchi reported issues in the e1000 and e1000e drivers
    for Intel gigabit network adapters which allow remote users to
    bypass packet filters using specially crafted Ethernet frames.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0003">CVE-2010-0003</a>

    <p>Andi Kleen reported a defect which allows local users to gain read
    access to memory reachable by the kernel when the
    print-fatal-signals option is enabled. This option is disabled by
    default.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0007">CVE-2010-0007</a>

    <p>Florian Westphal reported a lack of capability checking in the
    ebtables netfilter subsystem. If the ebtables module is loaded,
    local users can add and modify ebtables rules.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0291">CVE-2010-0291</a>

    <p>Al Viro reported several issues with the mmap/mremap system calls
    that allow local users to cause a denial of service (system panic)
    or obtain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0410">CVE-2010-0410</a>

     <p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered an issue in the netlink connector
     subsystem that permits local users to allocate large amounts of
     system memory resulting in a denial of service (out of memory).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0415">CVE-2010-0415</a>

    <p>Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered an issue in the sys_move_pages
    interface, limited to amd64, ia64 and powerpc64 flavors in Debian.
    Local users can exploit this issue to cause a denial of service
    (system crash) or gain access to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0622">CVE-2010-0622</a>

    <p>Jermome Marchand reported an issue in the futex subsystem that
    allows a local user to force an invalid futex state which results
    in a denial of service (oops).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.9etch3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.</p>
