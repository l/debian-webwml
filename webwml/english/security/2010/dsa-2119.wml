<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joel Voss of Leviathan Security Group discovered two vulnerabilities in
the Poppler PDF rendering library, which may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.</p>
