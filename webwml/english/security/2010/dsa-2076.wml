<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that GnuPG 2 uses a freed pointer when verifying a
signature or importing a certificate with many Subject Alternate Names,
potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.9-3.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version  2.0.14-2.</p>

<p>GnuPG 1 (in the gnupg package) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 packages.</p>
