<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that imlib2, a library to load and process several image
formats, did not properly process various image file types.</p>

<p>Several heap and stack based buffer overflows - partly due to integer
overflows - in the ARGB, BMP, JPEG, LBM, PNM, TGA and XPM loaders can
lead to the execution of arbitrary code via crafted image files.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-1.2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.</p>
