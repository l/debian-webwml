<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mediawiki, a web-based wiki
engine.  The following issues have been identified:</p>

<p>Insufficient input sanitization in the CSS validation code allows editors
to display external images in wiki pages.  This can be a privacy concern
on public wikis as it allows attackers to gather IP addresses and other
information by linking these images to a web server under their control.</p>

<p>Insufficient permission checks have been found in thump.php which can lead
to disclosure of image files that are restricted to certain users
(e.g. with img_auth.php).</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.0-2lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.15.2-1.</p>
