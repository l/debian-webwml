<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered that cacti, a front-end to rrdtool for monitoring
systems and services, is not properly validating input passed to the rra_id
parameter of the graph.php script.  Due to checking the input of $_REQUEST
but using $_GET input in a query an unauthenticated attacker is able to
perform SQL injections via a crafted rra_id $_GET value and an additional
valid rra_id $_POST or $_COOKIE value.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7b-2.1+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7e-4.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.</p>
