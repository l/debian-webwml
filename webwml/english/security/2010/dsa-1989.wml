<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered a race condition in FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace.
A local attacker, with access to use FUSE, could unmount arbitrary
locations, leading to a denial of service.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3-4.4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.4-1.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.1-1.2, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
