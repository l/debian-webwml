<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print,
and login server for Unix.</p>

<p>The sid_parse() function does not correctly check its input lengths
when reading a binary representation of a Windows SID (Security ID).
This allows a malicious client to send a sid that can overflow the
stack variable that is being used to store the SID in the Samba smbd
server. (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2010-3069">CVE-2010-3069</a>)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.5-4lenny13.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed in version 3.5.5~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages. The packages for the
mips architecture are not included in this upgrade. They will be released
as soon as they become available.</p>
