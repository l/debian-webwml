<p>Stefan Goebel discovered that the Debian version of trac-git, the Git
add-on for the Trac issue tracking system, contains a flaw which
enables attackers to execute code on the web server running trac-git
by sending crafted HTTP queries.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain a trac-git package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20080710-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 0.0.20090320-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trac-git package.</p>
