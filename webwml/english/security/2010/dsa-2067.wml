<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids identify them:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1667">CVE-2010-1667</a>

    <p>Multiple pages performed insufficient input sanitising, making them
    vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1668">CVE-2010-1668</a>

    <p>Multiple forms lacked protection against cross-site request forgery
    attacks, therefore making them vulnerable.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1670">CVE-2010-1670</a>

    <p>Gregor Anzelj discovered that it was possible to accidentally
    configure an installation of mahara that allows access to another
    user's account without a password.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2479">CVE-2010-2479</a>

    <p>Certain Internet Explorer-specific cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities were discovered in HTML Purifier, of which a copy
    is included in the mahara package.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), the problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), the problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.5.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
