<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2042">CVE-2009-2042</a>

<p>libpng does not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images with width values
that are not divisible by 8, which causes libpng to include
uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file and might allow remote
attackers to read portions of sensitive memory via "out-of-bounds
pixels" in the file.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0205">CVE-2010-0205</a>

<p>libpng does not properly handle compressed ancillary-chunk data that has
a disproportionately large uncompressed representation, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU
consumption, and  application hang) via a crafted PNG file</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these
problems have been fixed in version 1.2.43-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng package.</p>
