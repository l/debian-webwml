<define-tag description>arbitrary code execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in exim4 that allow a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code as root user. Exploits for these
issues have been seen in the wild.</p>

<p>This update fixes a memory corruption issue that allows a remote
attacker to execute arbitrary code as the Debian-exim user
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4344">CVE-2010-4344</a>).</p>

<p>A fix for an additional issue that allows the Debian-exim user to
obtain root privileges (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4345">CVE-2010-4345</a>) is currently being checked for
compatibility issues. It is not yet included in this upgrade but will
released soon in an update to this advisory.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.69-9+lenny1.</p>

<p>This advisory only contains the packages for the alpha, amd64, hppa,
i386, ia64, powerpc, and s390 architectures. The packages for the
arm, armel, mips, mipsel, and sparc architectures will be released
as soon as they are built.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.70-1.</p>

<p>We strongly recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
