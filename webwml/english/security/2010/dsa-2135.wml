<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joel Voss of Leviathan Security Group discovered two vulnerabilities
in xpdf rendering engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code if a malformed PDF file is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.02-1.4+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable 
distribution (sid), these problems don't apply, since xpdf has been 
patched to use the Poppler PDF library.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.</p>
