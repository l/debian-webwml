<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenLDAP.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0211">CVE-2010-0211</a>

    <p>The slap_modrdn2mods function in modrdn.c in OpenLDAP 2.4.22 does
    not check the return value of a call to the smr_normalize
    function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (segmentation fault) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a modrdn call with an RDN string containing invalid UTF-8
    sequences.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0212">CVE-2010-0212</a>

    <p>OpenLDAP 2.4.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (crash) via a modrdn call with a zero-length RDN
    destination string.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.11-1+lenny2.  (The missing update for the mips
architecture will be provided soon.)</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.23-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.</p>
