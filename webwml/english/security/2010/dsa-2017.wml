<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that the PulseAudio sound server creates a
temporary directory with a predictable name. This allows a local attacker
to create a Denial of Service condition or possibly disclose sensitive
information to unprivileged users.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.10-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pulseaudio package.</p>
