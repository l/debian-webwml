<define-tag description>missing input sanitizing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that in lxr-cvs, a code-indexing tool with a
web frontend, not enough sanitation of user input is performed; an
attacker can take advantage of this and pass script code in order to
perform cross-site scripting attacks.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5+cvs20071020-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.5+cvs20071020-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lxr-cvs packages.</p>
