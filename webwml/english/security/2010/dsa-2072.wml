<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libpng, a library for
reading and writing PNG files. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1205">CVE-2010-1205</a>

    <p>It was discovered a buffer overflow in libpng which allows remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a PNG image that triggers 
    an additional data row.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2249">CVE-2010-2249</a>

    <p>It was discovered a memory leak in libpng which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and
    application crash) via a PNG image containing malformed Physical
    Scale (aka sCAL) chunks</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.27-2+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, these
problems have been fixed in version 1.2.44-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng package.</p>
