<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4537">CVE-2009-4537</a>

    <p>Fabian Yamaguchi reported a missing check for Ethernet frames larger
    than the MTU in the r8169 driver. This may allow users on the local
    network to crash a system, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0727">CVE-2010-0727</a>

    <p>Sachin Prabhu reported an issue in the GFS2 filesystem. Local users
    can trigger a BUG() altering the permissions on a locked file,
    resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1083">CVE-2010-1083</a>

    <p>Linus Torvalds reported an issue in the USB subsystem, which may allow
    local users to obtain portions of sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1084">CVE-2010-1084</a>

    <p>Neil Brown reported an issue in the Bluetooth subsystem that may
    permit remote attackers to overwrite memory through the creation
    of large numbers of sockets, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1086">CVE-2010-1086</a>

    <p>Ang Way Chuang reported an issue in the DVB subsystem for Digital
    TV adapters. By creating a specially-encoded MPEG2-TS frame, a remote
    attacker could cause the receiver to enter an endless loop, resulting
    in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1087">CVE-2010-1087</a>

    <p>Trond Myklebust reported an issue in the NFS filesystem. A local
    user may cause an oops by sending a fatal signal during a file
    truncation operation, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1088">CVE-2010-1088</a>

    <p>Al Viro reported an issue where automount symlinks may not
    be followed when LOOKUP_FOLLOW is not set. This has an unknown
    security impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1162">CVE-2010-1162</a>

    <p>Catalin Marinas reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows
    local attackers to cause a kernel memory leak, possibly resulting
    in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1173">CVE-2010-1173</a>

    <p>Chris Guo from Nokia China and Jukka Taimisto and Olli Jarva from
    Codenomicon Ltd reported an issue in the SCTP subsystem that allows
    a remote attacker to cause a denial of service using a malformed init
    package.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1187">CVE-2010-1187</a>

    <p>Neil Hormon reported an issue in the TIPC subsystem. Local users can
    cause a denial of service by way of a NULL pointer dereference by
    sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1437">CVE-2010-1437</a>

    <p>Toshiyuki Okajima reported a race condition in the keyring subsystem.
    Local users can cause memory corruption via keyctl commands that
    access a keyring in the process of being deleted, resulting in a
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1446">CVE-2010-1446</a>

    <p>Wufei reported an issue with kgdb on the PowerPC architecture,
    allowing local users to write to kernel memory. Note: this issue
    does not affect binary kernels provided by Debian. The fix is
    provided for the benefit of users who build their own kernels
    from Debian source.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1451">CVE-2010-1451</a>

    <p>Brad Spengler reported an issue on the SPARC architecture that allows
    local users to execute non-executable pages.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This update also includes fixes a regression introduced by a previous
update. See the referenced Debian bug page for details.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-22lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>The user-mode-linux source package was additional rebuilt for
compatibility to take advantage of this update. The updated version of
the package is 2.6.26-1um-2+22lenny1.</p>
