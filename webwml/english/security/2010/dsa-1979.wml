<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in lintian,
a Debian package checker. The following Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project ids have been assigned to identify them:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4013">CVE-2009-4013</a>: missing control files sanitation

    <p>Control field names and values were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.</p>

    <p>Patch systems' control files were not sanitised before using them
    in certain operations that could lead to directory traversals.</p>

    <p>An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to overwrite
    arbitrary files or disclose system information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4014">CVE-2009-4014</a>: format string vulnerabilities

    <p>Multiple check scripts and the Lintian::Schedule module were using
    user-provided input as part of the sprintf/printf format string.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4015">CVE-2009-4015</a>: arbitrary command execution

    <p>File names were not properly escaped when passing them as arguments
    to certain commands, allowing the execution of other commands as
    pipes or as a set of shell commands.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.23.28+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24.2.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.2</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lintian packages.</p>
