<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in qt4-x11, a cross-platform
C++ application framework.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0945">CVE-2009-0945</a>

<p>Array index error in the insertItemBefore method in WebKit, as used in qt4-x11,
allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1687">CVE-2009-1687</a>

<p>The JavaScript garbage collector in WebKit, as used in qt4-x11 does not
properly handle allocation failures, which allows remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption
and application crash) via a crafted HTML document that triggers write
access to an "offset of a NULL pointer.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1690">CVE-2009-1690</a>

<p>Use-after-free vulnerability in WebKit, as used in qt4-x11, allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory
corruption and application crash) by setting an unspecified property of
an HTML tag that causes child elements to be freed and later accessed
when an HTML error occurs.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1698">CVE-2009-1698</a>

<p>WebKit in qt4-x11 does not initialize a pointer during handling of a
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attr function call with a large numerical
argument, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via
a crafted HTML document.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1699">CVE-2009-1699</a>

<p>The XSL stylesheet implementation in WebKit, as used in qt4-x11 does
not properly handle XML external entities, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary files via a crafted DTD.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1711">CVE-2009-1711</a>

<p>WebKit in qt4-x11 does not properly initialize memory for Attr DOM objects,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
of service (application crash) via a crafted HTML document.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1712">CVE-2009-1712</a>

<p>WebKit in qt4-x11 does not prevent remote loading of local Java applets,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, gain privileges, or
obtain sensitive information via an APPLET or OBJECT element.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1713">CVE-2009-1713</a>

<p>The XSLT functionality in WebKit, as used in qt4-x11 does not properly
implement the document function, which allows remote attackers to read
arbitrary local files and files from different security zones.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1725">CVE-2009-1725</a>

<p>WebKit in qt4-x11 does not properly handle numeric character references,
which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a
denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a
crafted HTML document.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2700">CVE-2009-2700</a>

<p>qt4-x11 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the
Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.4.3-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qt4-x11 packages.</p>
