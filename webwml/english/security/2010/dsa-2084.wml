<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kevin Finisterre discovered that several integer overflows in the TIFF
library could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.2-11.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
