<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Robert Swiecki discovered several vulnerabilities in the FreeType font 
library, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed font file is processed.</p>

<p>Also, several buffer overflows were found in the included demo programs.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.7-2+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
