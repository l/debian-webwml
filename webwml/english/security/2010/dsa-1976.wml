<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dokuwiki, a standards compliant
simple to use wiki.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>


<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0287">CVE-2010-0287</a>

<p>It was discovered that an internal variable is not properly sanitized before
being used to list directories. This can be exploited to list contents of
arbitrary directories.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0288">CVE-2010-0288</a>

<p>It was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't properly check the
administrator permissions. This allow an attacker to introduce arbitrary ACL
rules and thus gaining access to a closed Wiki.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0289">CVE-2010-0289</a>

<p>It was discovered that the ACL Manager plugin doesn't have protections against
cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). This can be exploited to change the
access control rules by tricking a logged in administrator into visiting
a malicious web site.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.0.20080505-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.0.20090214b-3.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dokuwiki package.</p>
