<define-tag description>untrusted search path</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Rosenberg discovered that in couchdb, a distributed,
fault-tolerant and schema-free document-oriented database, an insecure
library search path is used. A local attacker could execute arbitrary
code by first dumping a maliciously crafted shared library in some
directory, and then having an administrator run couchdb from this same
directory.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.0-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your couchdb package.</p>
