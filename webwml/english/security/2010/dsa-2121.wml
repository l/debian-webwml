<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in TYPO3.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3714">CVE-2010-3714</a>
	<p>Multiple remote file disclosure vulnerabilities in the jumpUrl
	mechanism and the Extension Manager allowed attackers to read
	files with the privileges of the account under which the web
	server was running.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3715">CVE-2010-3715</a>
	<p>The TYPO3 backend contained several cross-site scripting
	vulnerabilities, and the RemoveXSS function did not filter
	all Javascript code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3716">CVE-2010-3716</a>
	<p>Malicious editors with user creation permission could escalate
	their privileges by creating new users in arbitrary groups, due
	to lack of input validation in the taskcenter.</p></li>
	
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3717">CVE-2010-3717</a>
	<p>TYPO3 exposed a crasher bug in the PHP filter_var function,
	enabling attackers to cause the web server process to crash
	and thus consume additional system resources.</p></li>
	
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1+lenny6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the upcoming stable
distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in version
4.3.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.</p>
