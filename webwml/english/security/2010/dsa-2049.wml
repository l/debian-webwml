<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that barnowl, a curses-based tty Jabber, IRC, AIM
and Zephyr client, is prone to a buffer overflow via its "CC:" handling,
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.5.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your barnowl packages.</p>
