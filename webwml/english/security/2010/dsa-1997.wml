<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>


<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4019">CVE-2009-4019</a>

<p>Domas Mituzas discovered that mysqld does not properly handle errors during
execution of certain SELECT statements with subqueries, and does not preserve
certain null_value flags during execution of statements that use the
GeomFromWKB function, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a
denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted statement.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4030">CVE-2009-4030</a>

<p>Sergei Golubchik discovered that MySQL allows local users to bypass certain
privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified
DATA DIRECTORY or INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are originally associated
with pathnames without symlinks, and that can point to tables created at
a future time at which a pathname is modified to contain a symlink to a
subdirectory of the MySQL data home directory.</p></li>


<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4484">CVE-2009-4484</a>

<p>Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the CertDecoder::GetName function
in src/asn.cpp in TaoCrypt in yaSSL before 1.9.9, as used in mysqld, allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service
(memory corruption and daemon crash) by establishing an SSL connection and
sending an X.509 client certificate with a crafted name field.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch12</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny3</p>

<p>The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5 anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.</p>
