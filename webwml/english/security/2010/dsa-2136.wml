<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Willem Pinckaers discovered that Tor, a tool to enable online anonymity,
does not correctly handle all data read from the network.  By supplying
specially crafted packets a remote attacker can cause Tor to overflow its
heap, crashing the process. Arbitrary code execution has not been
confirmed but there is a potential risk.</p>

<p>In the stable distribution (lenny), this update also includes an update of
the IP address for the Tor directory authority gabelmoo and addresses
a weakness in the package's postinst maintainer script.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1.26-1~lenny+4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.2.1.26-6.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
