<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2539">CVE-2010-2539</a>

  <p>A stack-based buffer overflow in the msTmpFile function might lead to
  arbitrary code execution under some conditions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2540">CVE-2010-2540</a>

  <p>It was discovered that the CGI debug command-line arguments which are
  enabled by default are insecure and may allow a remote attacker to
  execute arbitrary code. Therefore they have been disabled by default.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.4-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.4-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.</p>
