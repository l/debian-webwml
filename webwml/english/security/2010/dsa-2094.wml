<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4895">CVE-2009-4895</a>

    <p>Kyle Bader reported an issue in the tty subsystem that allows local
    users to create a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2226">CVE-2010-2226</a>

    <p>Dan Rosenberg reported an issue in the xfs filesystem that allows local
    users to copy and read a file owned by another user, for which they
    only have write permissions, due to a lack of permission checking in the
    XFS_SWAPEXT ioctl.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2240">CVE-2010-2240</a>

    <p>Rafal Wojtczuk reported an issue that allows users to obtain escalated
    privileges. Users must already have sufficient privileges to execute or
    connect clients to an Xorg server.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2248">CVE-2010-2248</a>

    <p>Suresh Jayaraman discovered an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A malicious
    file server can set an incorrect "CountHigh" value, resulting in a
    denial of service (BUG_ON() assertion).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2521">CVE-2010-2521</a>

    <p>Neil Brown reported an issue in the NFSv4 server code. A malicious client
    could trigger a denial of service (Oops) on a server due to a bug in
    the read_buf() routine.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2798">CVE-2010-2798</a>

    <p>Bob Peterson reported an issue in the GFS2 file system. A file system
    user could cause a denial of service (Oops) via certain rename
    operations.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2803">CVE-2010-2803</a>

    <p>Kees Cook reported an issue in the DRM (Direct Rendering Manager)
    subsystem. Local users with sufficient privileges (local X users
    or members of the 'video' group on a default Debian install) could
    acquire access to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2959">CVE-2010-2959</a>

    <p>Ben Hawkes discovered an issue in the AF_CAN socket family. An integer
    overflow condition may allow local users to obtain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-3015">CVE-2010-3015</a>

    <p>Toshiyuki Okajima reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users
    could trigger a denial of service (BUG assertion) by generating a specific
    set of filesystem operations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This update also includes fixes a regression introduced by a previous
update. See the referenced Debian bug page for details.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-24lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were
rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>         <th>Debian 5.0 (lenny)</th></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td> <td>2.6.26-1um-2+24lenny1</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>Updates for arm and mips will be released as they become
available.</p>
