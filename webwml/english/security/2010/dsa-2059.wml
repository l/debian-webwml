<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that PCSCD, a daemon to access smart cards, was vulnerable
to a buffer overflow allowing a local attacker to elevate his privileges
to root.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
1.4.102-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-1.</p>
