<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Matt Giuca discovered a buffer overflow in python-cjson, a fast JSON
encoder/decoder for Python.
This allows a remote attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash)
through a specially-crafted Python script.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.5-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and the unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
has been fixed in version 1.0.5-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-cjson package.</p>
