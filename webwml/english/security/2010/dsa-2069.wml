<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ZNC, an IRC bouncer, is vulnerable to denial
of service attacks via a NULL pointer dereference when traffic
statistics are requested while there is an unauthenticated connection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), the problem has been fixed in
version 0.058-2+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
the problem has been fixed in version 0.090-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your znc packages.</p>
