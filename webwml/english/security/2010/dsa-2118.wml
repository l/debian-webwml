<define-tag description>logic flaw</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kamesh Jayachandran and C. Michael Pilat discovered that the mod_dav_svn
module of Subversion, a version control system, is not properly enforcing
access rules which are scope-limited to named repositories.  If the
SVNPathAuthz option is set to <q>short_circuit</q> set this may enable an
unprivileged attacker to bypass intended access restrictions and disclose
or modify repository content.</p>

<p>As a workaround it is also possible to set SVNPathAuthz to <q>on</q> but be
advised that this can result in a performance decrease for large
repositories.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1dfsg1-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
