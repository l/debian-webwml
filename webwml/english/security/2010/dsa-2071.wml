<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dyon Balding discovered buffer overflows in the MikMod sound library, 
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a user is 
tricked into opening malformed Impulse Tracker or Ultratracker sound 
files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.11-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.11-6.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmikmod packages.</p>
