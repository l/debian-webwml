<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a buffer overflow in the internal 
string routines of the KDE core libraries, which could lead to the 
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-0lenny4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs packages.</p>
