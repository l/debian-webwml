<define-tag description>checksum verification weakness</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been found in krb5, the MIT implementation of
Kerberos.</p>

<p>MIT krb5 clients incorrectly accept an unkeyed checksums in the SAM-2
preauthentication challenge: An unauthenticated remote attacker could
alter a SAM-2 challenge, affecting the prompt text seen by the user or
the kind of response sent to the KDC. Under some circumstances, this
can negate the incremental security benefit of using a single-use
authentication mechanism token.</p>

<p>MIT krb5 incorrectly accepts RFC 3961 key-derivation checksums using
RC4 keys when verifying KRB-SAFE messages: An unauthenticated remote
attacker has a 1/256 chance of forging KRB-SAFE messages in an
application protocol if the targeted pre-existing session uses an RC4
session key. Few application protocols use KRB-SAFE messages.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project has assigned
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1323">CVE-2010-1323</a> to these issues.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny6.</p>

<p>The builds for the mips architecture are not included in this advisory.
They will be released as soon as they are available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problem have been fixed in version 1.8.3+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
