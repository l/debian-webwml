<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1626">CVE-2010-1626</a>

<p>MySQL allows local users to delete the data and index files of another
user's MyISAM table via a symlink attack in conjunction with the DROP
TABLE command.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1848">CVE-2010-1848</a>

<p>MySQL failed to check the table name argument of a COM_FIELD_LIST
command packet for validity and compliance to acceptable table name
standards. This allows an authenticated user with SELECT privileges on
one table to obtain the field definitions of any table in all other
databases and potentially of other MySQL instances accessible from the
server's file system.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1849">CVE-2010-1849</a>

<p>MySQL could be tricked to read packets indefinitely if it received a
packet larger than the maximum size of one packet.
This results in high CPU usage and thus denial of service conditions.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-1850">CVE-2010-1850</a>

<p>MySQL was susceptible to a buffer-overflow attack due to a
failure to perform bounds checking on the table name argument of a
COM_FIELD_LIST command packet. By sending long data for the table
name, a buffer is overflown, which could be exploited by an
authenticated user to inject malicious code.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny4</p>

<p>The testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution do not contain
mysql-dfsg-5.0 anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 package.</p>
