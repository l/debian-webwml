<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Streibelt reported a directory traversal flaw in the way the
Mailing List Managing Made Joyful mailing list manager processed
users' requests originating from the administrator web interface
without enough input validation. A remote, authenticated attacker could
use these flaws to write and/or delete arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.15-1.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.17-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mlmmj package.</p>
