<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Julien Cristau discovered that hybserv, a daemon running IRC services
for IRCD-Hybrid, is prone to a denial of service attack via the commands
option.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>Due to a bug in the archive system, it is not possible to release the
fix for the oldstable distribution (etch) simultaneously. Therefore,
etch will be fixed in version 1.9.2-4+etch1 as soon as it becomes
available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.2-4.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hybserv packages.</p>
