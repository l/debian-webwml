<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that sendmail, a Mail Transport Agent, does not properly handle
a '\0' character in a Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate.</p>

<p>This allows an attacker to spoof arbitrary SSL-based SMTP servers via a crafted server
certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, and to bypass intended
access restrictions via a crafted client certificate issued by a legitimate
Certification Authority.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.8-3+etch1</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.14.3-5+lenny1</p>

<p>For the  unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.14.3-9.1, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sendmail package.</p>
