<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in KPDF, a PDF viewer
for KDE, which allow the execution of arbitrary code or denial of 
service if a user is tricked into opening a crafted PDF document.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:3.5.9-3+lenny3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) no longer contains kpdf. It's replacement,
Okular, links against the poppler PDF library.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdegraphics packages.</p>
