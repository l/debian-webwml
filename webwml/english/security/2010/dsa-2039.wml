<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Cacti, a frontend to rrdtool for monitoring
systems and services missed input sanitising, making an SQL injection
attack possible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7b-2.1+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti package.</p>
