<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mikolaj Izdebski has discovered an integer overflow flaw in the 
BZ2_decompress function in bzip2/libbz2. An attacker could use a 
crafted bz2 file to cause a denial of service (application crash)
or potentially to execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0405">CVE-2010-0405</a>)</p>

<p>After the upgrade, all running services that use libbz2 need to be
restarted.</p>

<p>This update also provides rebuilt dpkg packages, which are statically
linked to the fixed version of libbz2. Updated packages for clamav,
which is also affected by this issue, will be provided on debian-volatile.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.5-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem in bzip2 will be fixed soon. Updated dpkg packages are not
necessary for testing/unstable.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bzip2 / dpkg packages.</p>
