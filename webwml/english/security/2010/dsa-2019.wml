<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Marc Schoenefeld discovered an improper input sanitization in Pango, a library
for layout and rendering of text, leading to array indexing error.
If a local user was tricked into loading a specially-crafted font file in an
application, using the Pango font rendering library, it could lead to denial
of service (application crash).</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.20.5-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 package.</p>
