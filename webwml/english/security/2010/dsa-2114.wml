<p>The Debian stable point release 5.0.6 included updated packages of
the Git revision control system in order to fix a security issue.
Unfortunately, the update introduced a regression which could make
it impossible to clone or create Git repositories.  This upgrade
fixes this regression, which is tracked as
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/595728">Debian bug #595728</a>.</p>

<p>The original security issue allowed an attacker to execute arbitrary
code if he could trick a local user to execute a git command in a
crafted working directory (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2542">CVE-2010-2542</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.6.5-3+lenny3.2.</p>

<p>The packages for the hppa architecture are not included in this
advisory.  However, the hppa architecture is not known to be affected
by the regression.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), the security issue has been fixed in version 1.7.1-1.1. These
distributions were not affected by the regression.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git-core packages.</p>
