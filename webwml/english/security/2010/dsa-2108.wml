<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that in cvsnt, a multi-platform version of the
original source code versioning system CVS, an error in the
authentication code allows a malicious, unprivileged user, through the
use of a specially crafted branch name, to gain write access to any
module or directory, including CVSROOT itself. The attacker can then
execute arbitrary code as root by modifying or adding administrative
scripts in that directory.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.03.2382-3.3+lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvsnt package.</p>
