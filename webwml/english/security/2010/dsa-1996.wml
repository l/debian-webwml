<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege
escalation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3939">CVE-2009-3939</a>

    <p>Joseph Malicki reported that the dbg_lvl sysfs attribute for the
    megaraid_sas device driver had world-writable permissions,
    permitting local users to modify logging settings.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4027">CVE-2009-4027</a>

    <p>Lennert Buytenhek reported a race in the mac80211 subsystem that
    may allow remote users to cause a denial of service (system crash)
    on a system connected to the same wireless network.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4536">CVE-2009-4536</a> <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4538">CVE-2009-4538</a>

    <p>Fabian Yamaguchi reported issues in the e1000 and e1000e drivers
    for Intel gigabit network adapters which allow remote users to
    bypass packet filters using specially crafted ethernet frames.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0003">CVE-2010-0003</a>

    <p>Andi Kleen reported a defect which allows local users to gain read
    access to memory reachable by the kernel when the
    print-fatal-signals option is enabled. This option is disabled by
    default.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0007">CVE-2010-0007</a>

    <p>Florian Westphal reported a lack of capability checking in the
    ebtables netfilter subsystem. If the ebtables module is loaded,
    local users can add and modify ebtables rules.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0291">CVE-2010-0291</a>

    <p>Al Viro reported several issues with the mmap/mremap system calls
    that allow local users to cause a denial of service (system panic)
    or obtain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0298">CVE-2010-0298</a> &amp; <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0306">CVE-2010-0306</a>

    <p>Gleb Natapov discovered issues in the KVM subsystem where missing
    permission checks (CPL/IOPL) permit a user in a guest system to
    denial of service a guest (system crash) or gain escalated
    privileges with the guest.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0307">CVE-2010-0307</a>

    <p>Mathias Krause reported an issue with the load_elf_binary code on
    the amd64 flavor kernels that allows local users to cause a denial
    of service (system crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0309">CVE-2010-0309</a>

    <p>Marcelo Tosatti fixed an issue in the PIT emulation code in the
    KVM subsystem that allows privileged users in a guest domain to
    cause a denial of service (crash) of the host system.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0410">CVE-2010-0410</a>

     <p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered an issue in the netlink connector
     subsystem that permits local users to allocate large amounts of
     system memory resulting in a denial of service (out of memory).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-0415">CVE-2010-0415</a>

    <p>Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered an issue in the sys_move_pages
    interface, limited to amd64, ia64 and powerpc64 flavors in Debian.
    Local users can exploit this issue to cause a denial of service
    (system crash) or gain access to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-21lenny3.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were
rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
