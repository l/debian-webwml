<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that smbind, a PHP-based tool for managing DNS zones
for BIND, does not properly validating input.
An unauthenticated remote attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands
or gain access to the admin account.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.7-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.7-5, and will migrate to the testing distribution (squeeze)
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smbind (0.4.7-3+lenny1) package.</p>
