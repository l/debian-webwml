<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A missing input sanitization in spamass-milter, a milter
used to filter mail through spamassassin, was discovered.
This allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-8+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution this problem
has been fixed in version 0.3.1-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spamass-milter package.</p>
