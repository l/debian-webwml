<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities related to XML processing were discovered in
PostgreSQL, an SQL database.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3488">CVE-2012-3488</a>

	<p>contrib/xml2's xslt_process() can be used to read and write
	external files and URLs.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3489">CVE-2012-3489</a>

	<p>xml_parse() fetches external files or URLs to resolve DTD and
	entity references in XML values.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update removes the problematic functionality, potentially
breaking applications which use it in a legitimate way.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of these vulnerabilities, it is possible that
attackers who have only indirect access to the database can supply
crafted XML data which exploits this vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.4.13-0squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.5-1 of the postgresql-9.1 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.</p>
