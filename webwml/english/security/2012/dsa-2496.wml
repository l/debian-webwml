<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>
   Due to the non-disclosure of security patch information from Oracle,
   we are forced to ship an upstream version update of MySQL 5.1.
   There are several known incompatible
   changes, which are listed in /usr/share/doc/mysql-server/NEWS.Debian.gz.
</p>

<p>Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream
version, 5.1.63, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements and corrections for data loss defects.  These changes are
described in the <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html">MySQL
release notes</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2122">CVE-2012-2122</a>,
an authentication bypass vulnerability, occurs only when
MySQL has been built in with certain optimisations enabled. The packages
in Debian stable (squeeze) are not known to be affected by this
vulnerability. It is addressed in this update nonetheless, so future
rebuilds will not become vulnerable to this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.63-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.1.62-1 of the mysql-5.1 package and version 5.5.24+dfsg-1
of the mysql-5.5 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your MySQL packages.</p>
