<define-tag description>authentication bypass</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An authentication bypass issue was discovered by the Codenomicon CROSS
project in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN solution. When using
RSA-based setups, a missing check in the gmp plugin could allow an
attacker presenting a forged signature to successfully authenticate
against a strongSwan responder.</p>

<p>The default configuration in Debian does not use the gmp plugin for
RSA operations but rather the OpenSSL plugin, so the packages as
shipped by Debian are not vulnerable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
