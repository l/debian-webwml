<define-tag description>insufficient filtering of rsync command line</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>James Clawson discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for OpenSSH to be used
with scp/sftp, rdist and cvs, was not correctly filtering command line options.
This could be used to force the execution of a remote script and thus allow
arbitrary command execution. Two CVE were assigned:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2251">CVE-2012-2251</a>

	<p>Incorrect filtering of command line when using rsync protocol. It was
	for example possible to pass dangerous options after a "--" switch. The rsync
	protocol support has been added in a Debian (and Fedora/Red Hat) specific
	patch, so this vulnerability doesn't affect upstream.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2252">CVE-2012-2252</a>

	<p>Incorrect filtering of the "--rsh" option: the filter preventing usage of the
	"--rsh=" option would not prevent passing "--rsh". This vulnerability affects
	upstream code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.</p>
