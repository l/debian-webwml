<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dave Love discovered that users who are allowed to submit jobs to a
Grid Engine installation can escalate their privileges to root because
the environment is not properly sanitized before creating processes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2u5-1squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2u5-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gridengine packages.</p>
