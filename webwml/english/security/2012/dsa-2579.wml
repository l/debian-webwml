<p>A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4557">CVE-2012-4557</a>

	<p>A flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend
	server that takes too long to respond. Given a specific
	configuration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,
	putting a backend server into an error state until the retry
	timeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of
	service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the
following issue:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929">CVE-2012-4929</a>

	<p>If using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection
	to a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain
	plaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the <q>CRIME</q>
	attack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by
	default. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported
	that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in
	environments where the <q>CRIME</q> attack is not an issue.
	For more information, please refer to the <a
	href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression">SSLCompression
	Directive documentation</a>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.16-6+squeeze10.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>
