<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Mahara, the portfolio, weblog, and resume builder,
had an insecure default with regards to SAML-based authentication used
with more than one SAML identity provider. Someone with control over one
IdP could impersonate users from other IdP's.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
