<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that PLIB, a library used by TORCS, contains a
buffer overflow in error message processing, which could allow remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.5-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.8.5-5.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your plib packages.</p>
