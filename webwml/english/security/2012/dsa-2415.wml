<p>Several vulnerabilities that can lead to the execution of arbitrary code
have been discovered in libmodplug, a library for MOD music based on
ModPlug.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1761">CVE-2011-1761</a>

    <p>epiphant discovered that the abc file parser is vulnerable to several
    stack-based buffer overflows that potentially lead to the execution
    of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2911">CVE-2011-2911</a>

    <p>Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadWav
    function is vulnerable to an integer overflow which leads to a
    heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to
    potentially execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening
    crafted WAV files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2912">CVE-2011-2912</a>

    <p>Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadS3M
    function is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow.  An attacker
    can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code by
    tricking a victim into opening crafted S3M files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2913">CVE-2011-2913</a>

    <p>Hossein Lotfi of Secunia discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS
    function suffers from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to
    memory corruption.  An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially
    execute arbitrary code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS
    files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2914">CVE-2011-2914</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadDSM function suffers
    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted DSM files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2915">CVE-2011-2915</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the CSoundFile::ReadAMS2 function suffers
    from an off-by-one vulnerability that leads to memory corruption.
    An attacker can exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary
    code by tricking a victim into opening crafted AMS files.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.1-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 1:0.8.8.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.</p>
