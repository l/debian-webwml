<define-tag description>privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Moin, a Python clone of WikiWiki, incorrectly
evaluates ACLs when virtual groups are involved. This may allow certain
users to have additional permissions (privilege escalation) or lack
expected permissions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.4-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your moin packages.</p>
