<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an
object-relational SQL database. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0866">CVE-2012-0866</a>

   <p>It was discovered that the permissions of a function called by a
   trigger are not checked. This could result in privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0867">CVE-2012-0867</a>

   <p>It was discovered that only the first 32 characters of a host name
   are checked when validating host names through SSL certificates.
   This could result in spoofing the connection in limited
   circumstances.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0868">CVE-2012-0868</a>

   <p>It was discovered that pg_dump did not sanitise object names.
   This could result in arbitrary SQL command execution if a
   malformed dump file is opened.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-0squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.</p>
