<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Mateusz Jurczyk from the Google Security Team discovered several
vulnerabilties in Freetype's parsing of BDF, Type1 and TrueType fonts,
which could result in the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
font file is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-2.1+squeeze4. The updated packages are already available
since yesterday, but the advisory text couldn't be send earlier.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
