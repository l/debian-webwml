<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in TYPO3, a content management
system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3527">CVE-2012-3527</a>

	<p>An insecure call to unserialize in the help system enables
	arbitrary code execution by authenticated users.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3528">CVE-2012-3528</a>

	<p>The TYPO3 backend contains several cross-site scripting
	vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3529">CVE-2012-3529</a>

	<p>Authenticated users who can access the configuration module
	can obtain the encryption key, allowing them to escalate their
	privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3530">CVE-2012-3530</a>

	<p>The RemoveXSS HTML sanitizer did not remove several HTML5
	JavaScript, thus failing to mitigate the impact of cross-site
	scripting vulnerabilities.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.5.19+dfsg1-1.</p>
