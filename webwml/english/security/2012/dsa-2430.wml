<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Markus Vervier discovered a double free in the Python interface to the
PAM library, which could lead to denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.2-12.2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.2-13.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-pam packages.</p>
