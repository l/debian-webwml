<p>De Eindbazen discovered that PHP, when run with mod_cgi, will
interpret a query string as command line parameters, allowing to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Additionally, this update fixes insufficient validation of upload
name which lead to corrupted $_FILES indices.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze9.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
