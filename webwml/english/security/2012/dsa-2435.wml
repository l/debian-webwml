<p>Several vulnerabilities have been identified in Gnash, the GNU Flash
player.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1175">CVE-2012-1175</a>

  <p>Tielei Wang from Georgia Tech Information Security Center discovered a
  vulnerability in GNU Gnash which is caused due to an integer overflow
  error and can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow by
  tricking a user into opening a specially crafted SWF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4328">CVE-2011-4328</a>

  <p>Alexander Kurtz discovered an unsafe management of HTTP cookies. Cookie
  files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the vulnerability
  allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files the users has
  write permissions for, and are also world-readable which may cause
  information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4337">CVE-2010-4337</a>

  <p>Jakub Wilk discovered an unsafe management of temporary files during the
  build process. Files are stored under /tmp and have predictable names, and the
  vulnerability allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files
  the users has write permissions for.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-5.</p>
