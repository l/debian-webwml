<p>Two security vulnerabilities affecting ISC dhcpd, a server for automatic
IP address assignment, in Debian have been discovered.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3571">CVE-2012-3571</a>

  <p>Markus Hietava of the Codenomicon CROSS project discovered that it is
  possible to force the server to enter an infinite loop via messages with
  malformed client identifiers.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3954">CVE-2012-3954</a>

  <p>Glen Eustace discovered that DHCP servers running in DHCPv6 mode
  and possibly DHCPv4 mode suffer of memory leaks while processing messages.
  An attacker can use this flaw to exhaust resources and perform denial
  of service attacks.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.</p>
