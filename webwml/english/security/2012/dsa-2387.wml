<p><q>timtai1</q> discovered that simpleSAMLphp, an authentication and federation
platform, is vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack, allowing a
remote attacker to access sensitive client data.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) does not contain a simplesamlphp
package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your simplesamlphp packages.</p>
