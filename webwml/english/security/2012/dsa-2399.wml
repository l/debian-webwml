<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1938">CVE-2011-1938</a>

  <p>The UNIX socket handling allowed attackers to trigger a buffer overflow
  via a long path name.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483">CVE-2011-2483</a>

  <p>The crypt_blowfish function did not properly handle 8-bit characters,
  which made it easier for attackers to determine a cleartext password
  by using knowledge of a password hash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4566">CVE-2011-4566</a>

  <p>When used on 32 bit platforms, the exif extension could be used to
  trigger an integer overflow in the exif_process_IFD_TAG function
  when processing a JPEG file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4885">CVE-2011-4885</a>

  <p>It was possible to trigger hash collisions predictably when parsing
  form parameters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
  service by sending many crafted parameters.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0057">CVE-2012-0057</a>

  <p>When applying a crafted XSLT transform, an attacker could write files
  to arbitrary places in the filesystem.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>NOTE: the fix for 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2483">CVE-2011-2483</a> 
required changing the behaviour of this function: it is now incompatible with 
some old (wrongly) generated hashes for passwords containing 8-bit characters. 
See the package NEWS entry for details. This change has not been applied to the 
Lenny version of PHP.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny15.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.3.3-7+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 5.3.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
