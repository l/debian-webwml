<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that tcsd (the TPM userspace daemon) was missing
input validation. Using carefully crafted input, it can lead to a denial of
service by making the daemon crash with a segmentation fault.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.5-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.9-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trousers packages.</p>
