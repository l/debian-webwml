<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0249">CVE-2012-0249</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in the
    OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a
    Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than
    the length specified in its header.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0250">CVE-2012-0250</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a
    Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a
    network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the
    data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length
    header field.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0255">CVE-2012-0255</a>

    <p>The BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers
    for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating
    a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion
    failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a
    malformed AS4 capability.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent
upstream release.  This release includes other corrections, such as
hardening against unknown BGP path attributes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.99.20.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
