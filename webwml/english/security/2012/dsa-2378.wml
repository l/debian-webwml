<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia 
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the decoders
for QDM2, VP5, VP6, VMD and SVQ1 files could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.5.6-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:0.7.3-1 of the libav source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
