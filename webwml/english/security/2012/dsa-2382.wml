<p>Several problems have been discovered in eCryptfs, a cryptographic
filesystem for Linux.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1831">CVE-2011-1831</a>

  <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading
  to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1832">CVE-2011-1832</a>

  <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs
  incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading
  to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1834">CVE-2011-1834</a>

  <p>Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly
  handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local
  attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly
  unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1835">CVE-2011-1835</a>

  <p>Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when
  setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use
  this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1837">CVE-2011-1837</a>

  <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled
  lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite
  arbitrary files.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>We acknowledge the work of the Ubuntu distribution in preparing patches
suitable for near-direct inclusion in the Debian package.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 68-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 83-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 95-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ecryptfs-utils packages.</p>
