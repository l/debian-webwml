<define-tag description>SSL certificate verification weakness</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ralf Paffrath reported that Radsecproxy, a RADIUS protocol proxy, mixed up 
pre- and post-handshake verification of clients. This vulnerability may
wrongly accept clients without checking their certificate chain under 
certain configurations.</p>

<p>Raphael Geissert spotted that the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4523">CVE-2012-4523</a> was incomplete, 
giving origin to <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4566">CVE-2012-4566</a>. Both vulnerabilities are fixed with this 
update.</p>

<p>Notice that this fix may make Radsecproxy reject some clients that are 
currently (erroneously) being accepted.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your radsecproxy packages.</p>
