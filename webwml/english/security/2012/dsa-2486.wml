<p>It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, can crash while processing
resource records containing no data bytes.  Both authoritative servers
and resolvers are affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
