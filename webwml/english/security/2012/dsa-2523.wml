<p>It was discovered that the GridFTP component from the Globus Toolkit, a
toolkit used for building Grid systems and applications, performed
insufficient validation of a name lookup, which could lead to privilege
escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.23-1+squeeze1 of the globus-gridftp-server source package
and in version 0.43-1+squeeze1 of the globus-gridftp-server-control
source package.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 6.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your globus-gridftp-server packages.</p>
