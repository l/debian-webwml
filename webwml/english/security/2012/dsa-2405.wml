<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3607">CVE-2011-3607</a>:

  <p>An integer overflow in ap_pregsub() could allow local attackers to
  execute arbitrary code at elevated privileges via crafted .htaccess
  files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3368">CVE-2011-3368</a> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3639">CVE-2011-3639</a> <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4317">CVE-2011-4317</a>:

  <p>The Apache HTTP Server did not properly validate the request URI for
  proxied requests. In certain reverse proxy configurations using the
  ProxyPassMatch directive or using the RewriteRule directive with the
  [P] flag, a remote attacker could make the proxy connect to an
  arbitrary server. This could allow the attacker to access internal
  servers that are not otherwise accessible from the outside.</p>

  <p>The three CVE ids denote slightly different variants of the same
  issue.</p>

  <p>Note that, even with this issue fixed, it is the responsibility of
  the administrator to ensure that the regular expression replacement
  pattern for the target URI does not allow a client to append arbitrary
  strings to the host or port parts of the target URI. For example, the
  configuration</p>

<pre>
  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(.*)  http://internal-host$1
</pre>

  <p>is still insecure and should be replaced by one of the following
  configurations:</p>

<pre>
  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail(/.*)  http://internal-host$1
  ProxyPassMatch ^/mail/(.*)  http://internal-host/$1
</pre>
</li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0031">CVE-2012-0031</a>:

  <p>An apache2 child process could cause the parent process to crash
  during shutdown. This is a violation of the privilege separation
  between the apache2 processes and could potentially be used to worsen
  the impact of other vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0053">CVE-2012-0053</a>:

  <p>The response message for error code 400 (bad request) could be used to
  expose <q>httpOnly</q> cookies. This could allow a remote attacker using
  cross site scripting to steal authentication cookies.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.9-10+lenny12.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version apache2 2.2.16-6+squeeze6</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>

<p>This update also contains updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which have
been recompiled against the updated apache2 packages. The new version
number for the oldstable distribution is 2.2.6-02-1+lenny7. In the
stable distribution, apache2-mpm-itk has the same version number as
apache2.</p>
