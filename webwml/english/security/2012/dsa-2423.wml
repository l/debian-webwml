<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Movable Type, a blogging
system:</p>

<p>Under certain circumstances, a user who has <q>Create Entries</q> or
<q>Manage Blog</q> permissions may be able to read known files on the local
file system.</p>

<p>The file management system contains shell command injection
vulnerabilities, the most serious of which may lead to arbitrary OS
command execution by a user who has a permission to sign-in to the
admin script and also has a permission to upload files.</p>

<p>Session hijack and cross-site request forgery vulnerabilities exist in
the commenting and the community script. A remote attacker could
hijack the user session or could execute arbitrary script code on
victim's browser under the certain circumstances.</p>

<p>Templates which do not escape variable properly and mt-wizard.cgi
contain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.3.8+dfsg-0+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 5.1.3+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.</p>
