<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Qualys Vulnerability &amp; Malware Research Labs discovered a vulnerability in
ModSecurity, a security module for the Apache webserver. In situations where
both <q>Content:Disposition: attachment</q> and <q>Content-Type: multipart</q> were
present in HTTP headers, the vulnerability could allow an attacker to bypass
policy and execute cross-site script (XSS) attacks through properly crafted
HTML documents.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.12-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-1.</p>

<p>In testing and unstable distribution, the source package has been renamed to
modsecurity-apache.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-security packages.</p>
