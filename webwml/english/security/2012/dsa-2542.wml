<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in KVM, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2652">CVE-2012-2652</a>:

    <p>The snapshot mode of QEMU (-snapshot) incorrectly handles temporary
    files used to store the current state, making it vulnerable to
    symlink attacks (including arbitrary file overwriting and guest
    information disclosure) due to a race condition.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3515">CVE-2012-3515</a>:

    <p>QEMU does not properly handle VT100 escape sequences when emulating
    certain devices with a virtual console backend. An attacker within a
    guest with access to the vulnerable virtual console could overwrite
    memory of QEMU and escalate privileges to that of the qemu process.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will been fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
