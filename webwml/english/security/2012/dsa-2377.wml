<define-tag description>NULL pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable mail system designed
for use in enterprise environments, is not properly parsing mail headers
when a client makes use of the IMAP threading feature.  As a result, a NULL
pointer is dereferenced which crashes the daemon.  An attacker can trigger
this by sending a mail containing crafted reference headers and access the
mail with a client that uses the server threading feature of IMAP.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-19+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem has been
fixed in cyrus-imapd-2.4 version 2.4.11-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.</p>
