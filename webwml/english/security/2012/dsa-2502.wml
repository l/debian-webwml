<p>It was discovered that that the ElGamal code in PythonCrypto, a
collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols for Python used
insecure insufficient prime numbers in key generation, which lead to a
weakened signature or public key space, allowing easier brute force
attacks on such keys.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto packages. After
installing this update, previously generated keys need to be regenerated.</p>
