<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jeroen Dekkers and others reported several vulnerabilities in Django,
a Python Web framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project defines the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3442">CVE-2012-3442</a>

    <p>Two functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,
    which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting
    (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3443">CVE-2012-3443</a>

    <p>The ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image
    validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (memory consumption) by uploading an image file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3444">CVE-2012-3444</a>

    <p>The get_image_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality
    uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,
    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process
    or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
