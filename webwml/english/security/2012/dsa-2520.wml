<define-tag description>Multiple heap-based buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Warns from PRE-CERT discovered multiple heap-based buffer overflows in
OpenOffice.org, an office productivity suite. The issues lies in the XML
manifest encryption tag parsing code. Using specially crafted files, an
attacker can cause application crash and could cause arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze7.</p>

<p>openoffice.org package has been replaced by libreoffice in testing (wheezy) and
unstable (sid) distributions.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
