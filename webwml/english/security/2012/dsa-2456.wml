<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Danny Fullerton discovered a use-after-free in the Dropbear SSH daemon,
resulting in potential execution of arbitrary code. Exploitation is
limited to users, who have been authenticated through public key
authentication and for which command restrictions are in place.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.52-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2012.55-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2012.55-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dropbear packages.</p>
