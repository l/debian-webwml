<define-tag description>remote stack overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that dhcpcd, a DHCP client, was vulnerable to a stack
overflow. A malformed DHCP message could crash the client, causing a denial of
service, and potentially remote code execution through properly designed
malicous DHCP packets.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.3-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.3-11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.3-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dhcpcd package.</p>
