<define-tag description>HTTP header injection</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the CGI module for Perl does not filter LF
characters in the Set-Cookie and P3P headers, potentially allowing
attackers to inject HTTP headers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.49-1squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.61-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcgi-pm-perl packages.</p>
