<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Helmut Hummel of the TYPO3 security team discovered that TYPO3, a web
content management system, is not properly sanitizing output of the
exception handler.  This allows an attacker to conduct cross-site
scripting attacks if either third-party extensions are installed that do
not sanitize this output on their own or in the presence of extensions
using the extbase MVC framework which accept objects to controller actions.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.</p>
