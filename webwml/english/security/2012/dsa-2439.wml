<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Glenn-Randers Pehrson discovered an buffer overflow in the libpng PNG 
library, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a 
malformed image is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze3. Packages for i386 are not yet available,
but will be provided shortly.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
