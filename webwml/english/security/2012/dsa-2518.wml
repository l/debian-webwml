<define-tag description>denial of service and remote code execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Emmanuel Bouillon from NCI Agency discovered multiple vulnerabilities in MIT
Kerberos, a daemon implementing the network authentication protocol.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1014">CVE-2012-1014</a>

	<p>By sending specially crafted AS-REQ (Authentication Service Request) to a KDC
	(Key Distribution Center), an attacker could make it free an uninitialized
	pointer, corrupting the heap.  This can lead to process crash or even arbitrary
	code execution.</p>

	<p>This CVE only affects testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1015">CVE-2012-1015</a>

	<p>By sending specially crafted AS-REQ to a KDC, an attacker could make it
	dereference an uninitialized pointer, leading to process crash or even
	arbitrary code execution</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In both cases, arbitrary code execution is believed to be difficult to achieve,
but might not be impossible.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
