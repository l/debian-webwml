<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple denial of service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,
an hypervisor. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3494">CVE-2012-3494</a>:

    <p>It was discovered that set_debugreg allows writes to reserved bits
    of the DR7 debug control register on amd64 (x86-64) paravirtualised
    guests, allowing a guest to crash the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3496">CVE-2012-3496</a>:

    <p>Matthew Daley discovered that XENMEM_populate_physmap, when called
    with the MEMF_populate_on_demand flag set, a BUG (detection routine)
    can be triggered if a translating paging mode is not being used,
    allowing a guest to crash the host.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
