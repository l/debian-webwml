<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been identified in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4540">CVE-2010-4540</a>

	<p>Stack-based buffer overflow in the load_preset_response
	function in plug-ins/lighting/lighting-ui.c in the <q>LIGHTING
	EFFECTS &amp; LIGHT</q> plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers
	to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly
	execute arbitrary code via a long <q>Position</q> field in a plugin
	configuration file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4541">CVE-2010-4541</a>

	<p>Stack-based buffer overflow in the loadit function in
	plug-ins/common/sphere-designer.c in the <q>SPHERE DESIGNER</q>
	plugin allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial
	of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
	code via a long <q>Number of lights</q> field in a plugin
	configuration file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4542">CVE-2010-4542</a>

	<p>Stack-based buffer overflow in the gfig_read_parameter_gimp_rgb
	function in the GFIG plugin allows user-assisted remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a long <q>Foreground</q> field in a
	plugin configuration file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4543">CVE-2010-4543</a>

	<p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the read_channel_data function in
	file-psp.c in the Paint Shop Pro (PSP) plugin allows remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
	possibly execute arbitrary code via a PSP_COMP_RLE (aka RLE
	compression) image file that begins a long run count at the end
	of the image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1782">CVE-2011-1782</a>

	<p>The correction for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-4543">\
	CVE-2010-4543</a> was incomplete.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2896">CVE-2011-2896</a>

	<p>The LZW decompressor in the LZWReadByte function in
	plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c does not properly handle code
	words that are absent from the decompression table when
	encountered, which allows remote attackers to trigger an
	infinite loop or a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly
	execute arbitrary code, via a crafted compressed stream.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.6.11-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.</p>
