<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Quagga, a routing daemon, contains a
vulnerability in processing the ORF capability in BGP OPEN messages.
A malformed OPEN message from a previously configured BGP peer could
cause bgpd to crash, causing a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.20.1-0+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.99.21-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
