<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Red Hat Security Response Team discovered that libproxy, a library
for automatic proxy configuration management, applied insufficient
validation to the Content-Length header sent by a server providing a
proxy.pac file. Such remote server could trigger an integer overflow
and consequently overflow an in-memory buffer.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.3.1-5.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libproxy packages.</p>
