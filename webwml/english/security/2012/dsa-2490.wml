<p>Kaspar Brand discovered that Mozilla's Network Security Services (NSS)
libraries did insufficient length checking in the QuickDER decoder,
allowing to crash a program using the libraries.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 2:3.13.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
