<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, an implementation
of TLS and related protocols.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4108">CVE-2011-4108</a>

	<p>The DTLS implementation performs a MAC check only if certain
	padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers
	to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4109">CVE-2011-4109</a> 

	<p>A double free vulnerability when X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is
	enabled, allows remote attackers to cause applications crashes
	and potentially allow execution of arbitrary code by
	triggering failure of a policy check.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4354">CVE-2011-4354</a>

	<p>On 32-bit systems, the operations on NIST elliptic curves
	P-256 and P-384 are not correctly implemented, potentially
	leaking the private ECC key of a TLS server.  (Regular
	RSA-based keys are not affected by this vulnerability.)</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4576">CVE-2011-4576</a>

	<p>The SSL 3.0 implementation does not properly initialize data
	structures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote
	attackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the
	padding data sent by an SSL peer.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4619">CVE-2011-4619</a>

	<p>The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL
	does not properly handle handshake restarts, unnecessarily
	simplifying CPU exhaustion attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8g-15+lenny15.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.9.8o-4squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.0.0f-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
