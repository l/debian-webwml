<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>cups-pk-helper, a PolicyKit helper to configure cups with fine-grained
privileges, wraps CUPS function calls in an insecure way. This could
lead to uploading sensitive data to a cups resource, or overwriting
specific files with the content of a cups resource. The user would have
to explicitly approve the action.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.0-3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups-pk-helper packages.</p>
