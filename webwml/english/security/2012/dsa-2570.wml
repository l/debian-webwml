<p>High-Tech Bridge SA Security Research Lab discovered multiple null-pointer
dereferences based vulnerabilities in OpenOffice which could cause
application crash or even arbitrary code execution using specially crafted
files. Affected file types are LWP (Lotus Word Pro), ODG, PPT (MS Powerpoint
2003) and XLS (MS Excel 2003).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze8.</p>

<p>openoffice.org package has been replaced by libreoffice in testing (wheezy)
and unstable (sid) distributions.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
