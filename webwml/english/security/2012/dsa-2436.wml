<define-tag description>inactive resource limits</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI implementation,
did not properly enforce the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass resource limit,
rendering this control ineffective and potentially allowing a virtual
host to consume excessive resources.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.</p>
