<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3377">CVE-2011-3377</a>

	<p>The IcedTea browser plugin included in the openjdk-6 package
	does not properly enforce the Same Origin Policy on web content
	served under a domain name which has a common suffix with the
	required domain name.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3563">CVE-2011-3563</a>

	<p>The Java Sound component did not properly check for array
	boundaries.  A malicious input or an untrusted Java application
	or applet could use this flaw to cause Java Virtual Machine to
	crash or disclose portion of its memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5035">CVE-2011-5035</a>

	<p>The OpenJDK embedded web server did not guard against an
	excessive number of a request parameters, leading to a denial
	of service vulnerability involving hash collisions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0497">CVE-2012-0497</a>

	<p>It was discovered that Java2D did not properly check graphics
	rendering objects before passing them to the native renderer.
	This could lead to JVM crash or Java sandbox bypass.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0501">CVE-2012-0501</a>

	<p>The ZIP central directory parser used by java.util.zip.ZipFile
	entered an infinite recursion in native code when processing a
	crafted ZIP file, leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0502">CVE-2012-0502</a>

	<p>A flaw was found in the AWT KeyboardFocusManager class that
	could allow untrusted Java applets to acquire keyboard focus
	and possibly steal sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0503">CVE-2012-0503</a>

	<p>The java.util.TimeZone.setDefault() method lacked a security
	manager invocation, allowing an untrusted Java application or
	applet to set a new default time zone.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0505">CVE-2012-0505</a>

	<p>The Java serialization code leaked references to serialization
	exceptions, possibly leaking critical objects to untrusted
	code in Java applets and applications.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0506">CVE-2012-0506</a>

	<p>It was discovered that CORBA implementation in Java did not
	properly protect repository identifiers (that can be obtained
	using _ids() method) on certain Corba objects.  This could
	have been used to perform modification of the data that should
	have been immutable.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0507">CVE-2012-0507</a>

	<p>The AtomicReferenceArray class implementation did not properly
	check if the array is of an expected Object[] type.  A
	malicious Java application or applet could use this flaw to
	cause Java Virtual Machine to crash or bypass Java sandbox
	restrictions.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b18-1.8.13-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6b24-1.11.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
