<define-tag description>null pointer dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marek Vavru≈°a and Lubos Slovak discovered that NSD, an authoritative
domain name server, is not properly handling non-standard DNS packets.
This can result in a NULL pointer dereference and crash the handling
process.  A remote attacker can abuse this flaw to perform denial of
service attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.5-1.squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nsd3 packages.</p>
