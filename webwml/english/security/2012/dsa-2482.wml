<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Vreixo Formoso discovered that libgdata, a library used to access various
Google services, wasn't validating certificates against trusted system
root CAs when using an HTTPS connection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.4-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgdata packages.</p>
