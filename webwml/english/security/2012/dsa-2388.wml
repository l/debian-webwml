<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in t1lib, a Postscript Type 1
font rasterizer library, some of which might lead to code execution
through the opening of files embedding bad fonts.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-2642">CVE-2010-2642</a>

	<p>A heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics parser
	potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0433">CVE-2011-0433</a>

	<p>Another heap-based buffer overflow in the AFM font metrics
	parser potentially leads to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-0764">CVE-2011-0764</a>

	<p>An invalid pointer dereference allows execution of arbitrary
	code using crafted Type 1 fonts.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1552">CVE-2011-1552</a>

	<p>Another invalid pointer dereference results in an application
	crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1553">CVE-2011-1553</a>

	<p>A use-after-free vulnerability results in an application
	crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1554">CVE-2011-1554</a>

	<p>An off-by-one error results in an invalid memory read and
	application crash, triggered by crafted Type 1 fonts.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-3.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your t1lib packages.</p>
