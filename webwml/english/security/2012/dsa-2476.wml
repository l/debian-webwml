<define-tag description>format string vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>intrigeri discovered a format string error in pidgin-otr, an Off-the-Record
Messaging plugin for Pidgin.</p>

<p>This could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause arbitrary code to
be executed on the user's machine.</p>

<p>The problem is only in pidgin-otr. Other applications which use libotr are
not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.0-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin-otr packages.</p>
