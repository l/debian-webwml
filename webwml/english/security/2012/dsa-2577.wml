<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libssh by Florian Weimer and Xi
Wang:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4559">CVE-2012-4559</a>:
multiple double free() flaws
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4561">CVE-2012-4561</a>:
multiple invalid free() flaws
</p></li>
<li><p>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4562">CVE-2012-4562</a>:
multiple improper overflow checks
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Those could lead to a denial of service by making an SSH client linked to
libssh crash, and maybe even arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.5-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libssh packages.</p>
