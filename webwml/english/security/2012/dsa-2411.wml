<p>It was discovered that Mumble, a VoIP client, does not properly manage
permissions on its user-specific configuration files, allowing other
local users on the system to access them.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-6+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.</p>
