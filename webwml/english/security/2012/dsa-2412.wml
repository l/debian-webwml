<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a heap overflow in the Vorbis audio compression
library could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
Ogg Vorbis file is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvorbis packages.</p>
