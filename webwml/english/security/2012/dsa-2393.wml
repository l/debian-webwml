<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Julien Tinnes reported a buffer overflow in the Bip multiuser IRC proxy
which may allow arbitrary code execution by remote users.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.2-1squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bip packages.</p>
