<p>Matthew Hall discovered that GNUTLS does not properly handle truncated
GenericBlockCipher structures nested inside TLS records, leading to
crashes in applications using the GNUTLS library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.18-1 of the gnutls26 package and version 3.0.17-2 of the
gnutls28 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
