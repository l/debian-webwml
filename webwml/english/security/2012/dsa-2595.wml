<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marc Schoenefeld discovered that an integer overflow in the ICC parsing
code of Ghostscript can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.71~dfsg2-9+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.05~dfsg-6.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.05~dfsg-6.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.</p>
