<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor, an online privacy
tool.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3518">CVE-2012-3518</a>

  <p>Avoid an uninitialised memory read when reading a vote or consensus
  document that has an unrecognized flavour name. This could lead to
  a remote crash, resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3519">CVE-2012-3519</a>

  <p>Try to leak less information about what relays a client is choosing to
  a side-channel attacker.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4419">CVE-2012-4419</a>

  <p>By providing specially crafted date strings to a victim tor instance,
  an attacker can cause it to run into an assertion and shut down.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally the update to stable includes the following fixes:
  when waiting for a client to renegotiate, don't allow it to add any
  bytes to the input buffer. This fixes a potential DoS issue
[<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/5934">tor-5934</a>, 
<a href="https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/6007">tor-6007</a>].
</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.2.39-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution, these problems have been fixed in version
0.2.3.22-rc-1.</p>
