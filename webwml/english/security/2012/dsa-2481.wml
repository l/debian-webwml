<define-tag description>fails to drop supplementary groups</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Grubb from Red Hat discovered that a patch for arpwatch (as shipped at
least in Red Hat and Debian distributions) in order to make it drop root
privileges would fail to do so and instead add the root group to the list of
the daemon uses.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1a15-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your arpwatch packages.</p>
