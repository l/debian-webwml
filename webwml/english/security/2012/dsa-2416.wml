<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Notmuch, an email indexer, did not sufficiently
escape Emacs MML tags. When using the Emacs interface, a user could
be tricked into replying to a maliciously formatted message which could
lead to files from the local machine being attached to the outgoing
message.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.11.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your notmuch packages.</p>
