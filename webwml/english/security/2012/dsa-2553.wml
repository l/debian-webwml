<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-18.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.7esr-2.</p>
