<define-tag description>UDP traffic amplification</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that spoofed <q>getstatus</q> UDP requests are being
sent by attackers to servers for use with games derived from the
Quake 3 engine (such as openarena).  These servers respond with a
packet flood to the victim whose IP address was impersonated by the
attackers, causing a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.5-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openarena packages.</p>
