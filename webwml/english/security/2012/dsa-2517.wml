<p>Einar Lonn discovered that under certain conditions bind9, a DNS server,
may use cached data before initialization.  As a result, an attacker can
trigger an assertion failure on servers under high query load that do
DNSSEC validation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.1.dfsg.P1-4.2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
