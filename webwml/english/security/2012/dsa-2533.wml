<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Performance Co-Pilot (pcp), a framework for
performance monitoring, contains several vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3418">CVE-2012-3418</a>

	<p>Multiple buffer overflows in the PCP protocol decoders can
	cause PCP clients and servers to crash or, potentially,
	execute arbitrary code while processing crafted PDUs.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3419">CVE-2012-3419</a>

	<p>The <q>linux</q> PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive
	information from the /proc file system to unauthenticated
	clients.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3420">CVE-2012-3420</a>

	<p>Multiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause
	pmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3421">CVE-2012-3421</a>

	<p>Incorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to
	prevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>To address the information disclosure vulnerability, 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3419">CVE-2012-3419</a>, a
new <q>proc</q> PMDA was introduced, which is disabled by default.  If you
need access to this information, you need to enable the <q>proc</q> PMDA.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pcp packages.</p>
