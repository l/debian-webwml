<define-tag description>unbounded memory allocation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Apache POI, a Java implementation of the
Microsoft Office file formats, would allocate arbitrary amounts of
memory when processing crafted documents.  This could impact the
stability of the Java virtual machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6+dfsg-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libjakarta-poi-java packages.</p>
