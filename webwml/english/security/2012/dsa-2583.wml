<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, the Debian web browser
based on Mozilla Firefox:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5829">CVE-2012-5829</a>

  <p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5842">CVE-2012-5842</a>

  <p>Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could allow remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application
  crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4207">CVE-2012-4207</a>

  <p>The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle a ~
  (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which allows remote
  attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted
  document.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4201">CVE-2012-4201</a>

  <p>The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during the
  handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href property, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or read
  arbitrary files by leveraging a sandboxed add-on.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4216">CVE-2012-4216</a>

  <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function allows
  remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap
  memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.16-20.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
