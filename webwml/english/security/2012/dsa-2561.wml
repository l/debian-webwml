<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in libtiff's parsing of files
using PixarLog compression could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.9.6-9 of the tiff3
source package and in version 4.0.2-4 of the tiff source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
