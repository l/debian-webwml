<p>It was discovered that Raptor, a RDF parser and serializer library,
allows file inclusion through XML entities, resulting in information
disclosure.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.21-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your raptor packages.</p>
