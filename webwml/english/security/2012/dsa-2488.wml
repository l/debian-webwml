<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web
browser based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides
rendering services for several other applications included in Debian.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1937">CVE-2012-1937</a>

  <p>Mozilla developers discovered several memory corruption bugs,
  which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1940">CVE-2012-1940</a>

  <p>Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem when working
  with column layout with absolute positioning in a container that
  changes size, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1947">CVE-2012-1947</a>

  <p>Abhishek Arya discovered a heap buffer overflow in utf16 to latin1
  character set conversion, allowing to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian
stable to consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended
Support Release) which is now available in Debian Backports.
Although Debian will continue to support Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with
security updates, this can only be done on a best effort base as
upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the 10.0
branch adds proactive security features to the browser.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-16.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.5esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
