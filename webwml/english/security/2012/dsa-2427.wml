<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Two security vulnerabilities related to EXIF processing were
discovered in ImageMagick, a suite of programs to manipulate images.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0247">CVE-2012-0247</a>

	<p>When parsing a maliciously crafted image with incorrect offset
	and count in the ResolutionUnit tag in EXIF IFD0, ImageMagick
	writes two bytes to an invalid address.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0248">CVE-2012-0248</a>

	<p>Parsing a maliciously crafted image with an IFD whose all IOP
	tags value offsets point to the beginning of the IFD itself
	results in an endless loop and a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 8:6.6.9.7-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
