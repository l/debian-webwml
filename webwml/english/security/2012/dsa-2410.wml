<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jueri Aedla discovered an integer overflow in the libpng PNG library,
which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
image is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.44-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
