<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that SQLAlchemy, an SQL toolkit and object relational
mapper for Python, is not sanitizing input passed to the limit/offset
keywords to select() as well as the value passed to select.limit()/offset().
This allows an attacker to perform SQL injection attacks against
applications using SQLAlchemy that do not implement their own filtering.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sqlalchemy packages.</p>
