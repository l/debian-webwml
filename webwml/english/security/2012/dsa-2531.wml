<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities have been discovered in Xen,
the popular virtualization software. The Common Vulnerabilities and 
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3432">CVE-2012-3432</a>

 <p>Guest mode unprivileged code, which has been granted the privilege to 
 access MMIO regions, may leverage that access to crash the whole guest.
 Since this can be used to crash a client from within, this vulnerability is
 considered to have low impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3433">CVE-2012-3433</a>

 <p>A guest kernel can cause the host to become unresponsive for a period
 of time, potentially leading to a DoS. Since an attacker with full
 control in the guest can impact the host, this vulnerability is
 considered to have high impact.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
