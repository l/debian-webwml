<define-tag description>packet loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ray Morris discovered that the PowerDNS authoritative server responds
to response packets.  An attacker who can spoof the source address of
IP packets can cause an endless packet loop between a PowerDNS
authoritative server and another DNS server, leading to a denial of
service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.21.2-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.22-8+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.</p>
