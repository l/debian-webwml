<define-tag description>missing bounds check</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matthew Hall discovered that many callers of the asn1_get_length_der
function did not check the result against the overall buffer length
before processing it further.  This could result in out-of-bounds
memory accesses and application crashes.  Applications using GNUTLS
are exposed to this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1+squeeze+1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.</p>
