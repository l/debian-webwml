<p>Nicholas Gregoire and Cris Neckar discovered several memory handling
bugs in libxslt, which could lead to denial of service or the execution
of arbitrary code if a malformed document is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.26-6+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.26-14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.</p>
