<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivano Cristofolini discovered that insufficient security checks in
Samba's handling of LSA RPC calls could lead to privilege escalation
by gaining the <q>take ownership</q> privilege.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
