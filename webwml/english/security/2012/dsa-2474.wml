<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ra√∫l Benencia discovered that ikiwiki, a wiki compiler, does not
properly escape the author (and its URL) of certain metadata, such as
comments. This might be used to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20100815.9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.20120516.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki packages.</p>
