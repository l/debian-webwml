<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Emanuel Bronshtein discovered that Mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder, contains multiple cross-site scripting
vulnerabilities due to missing sanitization and insufficient encoding
of user-supplied data.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.6-2+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
