<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>SÃ©bastien Bocahu discovered that the reverse proxy add forward module
for the Apache webserver is vulnerable to a denial of service attack
through a single crafted request with many headers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 0.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-rpaf packages.</p>
