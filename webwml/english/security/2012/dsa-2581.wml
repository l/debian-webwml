<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream version,
5.1.66, which includes additional changes, such as performance improvements and
corrections for data loss defects.  These changes are described in the 
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-66.html">\
MySQL release notes</a>.
</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), these
problems have been fixed in version 5.5.28+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>Additionally, <a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5611">CVE-2012-5611</a>
has been fixed in this upload. The vulnerability
(discovered independently by Tomas Hoger from the Red Hat Security Response
Team and <q>king cope</q>) is a stack-based buffer overflow in acl_get() when
checking user access to a database. Using a carefully crafted database name, an
already authenticated MySQL user could make the server crash or even execute
arbitrary code as the mysql system user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
5.1.66-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.</p>
