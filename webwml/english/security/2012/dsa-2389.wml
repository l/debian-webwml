<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2183">CVE-2011-2183</a>

    <p>Andrea Righi reported an issue in KSM, a memory-saving de-duplication
    feature. By exploiting a race with exiting tasks, local users can cause
    a kernel oops, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2213">CVE-2011-2213</a>

    <p>Dan Rosenberg discovered an issue in the INET socket monitoring interface.
    Local users could cause a denial of service by injecting code and causing
    the kernel to execute an infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-2898">CVE-2011-2898</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet reported an information leak in the raw packet socket
    implementation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3353">CVE-2011-3353</a>

    <p>Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a local denial of service issue in the FUSE
    (Filesystem in Userspace) support in the Linux kernel. Local users could
    cause a buffer overflow, leading to a kernel oops and resulting in a denial
    of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4077">CVE-2011-4077</a>

    <p>Carlos Maiolino reported an issue in the XFS filesystem. A local user
    with the ability to mount a filesystem could corrupt memory resulting
    in a denial of service or possibly gain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4110">CVE-2011-4110</a>

    <p>David Howells reported an issue in the kernel's access key retention
    system which allow local users to cause a kernel oops leading to a denial
    of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4127">CVE-2011-4127</a>

    <p>Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat reported an issue in the ioctl passthrough
    support for SCSI devices. Users with permission to access restricted
    portions of a device (e.g. a partition or a logical volume) can obtain
    access to the entire device by way of the SG_IO ioctl. This could be
    exploited by a local user or privileged VM guest to achieve a privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4611">CVE-2011-4611</a>

    <p>Maynard Johnson reported an issue with the perf support on POWER7 systems
    that allows local users to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4622">CVE-2011-4622</a>

    <p>Jan Kiszka reported an issue in the KVM PIT timer support. Local users
    with the permission to use KVM can cause a denial of service by starting
    a PIT timer without first setting up the irqchip.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4914">CVE-2011-4914</a>

    <p>Ben Hutchings reported various bounds checking issues within the ROSE
    protocol support in the kernel. Remote users could possibly use this
    to gain access to sensitive memory or cause a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-39squeeze1. Updates for issues impacting the oldstable distribution
(lenny) will be available soon.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
