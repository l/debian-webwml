<p>It was discovered that bacula, a network backup service, does not
properly enforce console ACLs. This could allow information about
resources to be dumped by an otherwise-restricted client.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-2.2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6+dfsg-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bacula packages.</p>
