<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several security vulnerabilities were discovered in MySQL, a database
management system.  The vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading
MySQL to a new upstream version, 5.1.61, which includes additional
changes, such as performance improvements and corrections for data
loss defects.  These changes are described in the MySQL release notes
at: <url http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/news-5-1-x.html>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.1.61-0+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.61-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.1 packages.</p>
