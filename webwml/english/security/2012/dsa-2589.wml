<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The tiff library for handling TIFF image files contained a stack-based
buffer overflow, potentially allowing attackers who can submit such
files to a vulnerable system to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.0.2-1 of the tiff
package, and version 3.9.6-10 of the tiff3 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
