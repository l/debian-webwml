<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Samba, the SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server,
contained a flaw in the remote procedure call (RPC) code which allowed
remote code execution as the super user from an unauthenticated
connection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.6.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
