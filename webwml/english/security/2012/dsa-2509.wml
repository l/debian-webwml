<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf H&auml;rnhammar found a buffer overflow in Pidgin, a multi protocol instant
messaging client. The vulnerability can be exploited by an incoming 
message in the MXit protocol plugin. A remote attacker may cause a crash,
and in some circumstances can lead to remote code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.3-1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.</p>
