<p>It was discovered that Beaker, a cache and session library for Python,
when using the python-crypto backend, is vulnerable to information
disclosure due to a cryptographic weakness related to the use of the
AES cipher in ECB mode.</p>

<p>Systems that have the python-pycryptopp package should not be
vulnerable, as this backend is preferred over python-crypto.</p>

<p>After applying this update, existing sessions will be invalidated.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.6.3-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your beaker packages.</p>
