<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management tool.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1053">CVE-2012-1053</a>

	<p>Puppet runs execs with an unintended group privileges,
	potentially leading to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1054">CVE-2012-1054</a>

	<p>The k5login type writes to untrusted locations,
	enabling local users to escalate their privileges
	if the k5login type is used.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6.2-5+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.7.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
