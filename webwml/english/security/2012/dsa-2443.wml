<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4307">CVE-2009-4307</a>

    <p>Nageswara R Sastry reported an issue in the ext4 filesystem. Local users
    with the privileges to mount a filesystem can cause a denial of service
    (BUG) by providing a s_log_groups_per_flex value greater than 31.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1833">CVE-2011-1833</a>

    <p>Vasiliy Kulikov of Openwall and Dan Rosenberg discovered an information
    leak in the eCryptfs filesystem. Local users were able to mount arbitrary
    directories.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4347">CVE-2011-4347</a>

    <p>Sasha Levin reported an issue in the device assignment functionality in
    KVM. Local users with permission to access /dev/kvm could assign unused pci
    devices to a guest and cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0045">CVE-2012-0045</a>

    <p>Stephan Barwolf reported an issue in KVM. Local users in a 32-bit guest
    running on a 64-bit system can crash the guest with a syscall instruction.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1090">CVE-2012-1090</a>

    <p>CAI Qian reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem. A reference count leak
    can occur during the lookup of special files, resulting in a denial of
    service (oops) on umount.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1097">CVE-2012-1097</a>

    <p>H. Peter Anvin reported an issue in the regset infrastructure. Local users
    can cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by triggering the
    write methods of readonly regsets.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-41squeeze2.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv">
    <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
        <tr>
            <th>&nbsp;</th>
            <th>Debian 6.0 (squeeze)</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>user-mode-linux</td>
            <td>2.6.32-1um-4+41squeeze2</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.</p>
