<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alexander Gavrun discovered an integer overflow in the TIFF library
in the parsing of the TileSize entry, which could result in the execution 
of arbitrary code if a malformed image is opened.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
