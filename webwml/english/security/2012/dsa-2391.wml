<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4107">CVE-2011-4107</a>

  <p>The XML import plugin allowed a remote attacker to read arbitrary
  files via XML data containing external entity references.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1940">CVE-2011-1940</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-3181">CVE-2011-3181</a>

  <p>Cross site scripting was possible in the table tracking feature,
  allowing a remote attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 4:3.3.7-7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 4:3.4.7.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin packages.</p>
