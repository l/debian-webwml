<p>Henrik Erkkonen discovered that rssh, a restricted shell for SSH, does
not properly restrict shell access.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-13squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rssh packages.</p>
