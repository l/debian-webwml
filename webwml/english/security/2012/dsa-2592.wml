<p>Marko Myllynen discovered that elinks, a powerful text-mode browser,
incorrectly delegates user credentials during GSS-Negotiate.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-2+squeeze1. Since the initial Squeeze release
Xulrunner needed to be updated and the version currently in the archive
is incompatible with Elinks. As such, Javascript support needed to be
disabled (only a small subset of typical functionality was supported
anyway). It will likely be re-enabled in a later point update.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12~pre5-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your elinks packages.</p>
