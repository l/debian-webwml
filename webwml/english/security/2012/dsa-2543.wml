<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in xen-qemu-dm-4.0, the Xen
QEMU Device Model virtual machine hardware emulator. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3515">CVE-2012-3515</a>:

    <p>The device model for HVM domains does not properly handle VT100
    escape sequences when emulating certain devices with a virtual
    console backend. An attacker within a guest with access to the
    vulnerable virtual console could overwrite memory of the device
    model and escalate privileges to that of the device model process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4411">CVE-2012-4411</a>:

    <p>The QEMU monitor was enabled by default, allowing administrators of
    a guest to access resources of the host, possibly escalate privileges
    or access resources belonging to another guest.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution (sid),
no longer contain this package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen-qemu-dm-4.0 packages.</p>
