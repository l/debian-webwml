<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4201">CVE-2012-4201</a>

  <p>The evalInSandbox implementation uses an incorrect context during
  the handling of JavaScript code that sets the location.href
  property, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site
  scripting (XSS) attacks or read arbitrary files by leveraging a
  sandboxed add-on.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4207">CVE-2012-4207</a>

  <p>The HZ-GB-2312 character-set implementation does not properly handle
  a ~ (tilde) character in proximity to a chunk delimiter, which
  allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS)
  attacks via a crafted document.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4216">CVE-2012-4216</a>

  <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in the gfxFont::GetFontEntry function
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial
  of service (heap memory corruption) via unspecified vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5829">CVE-2012-5829</a>

  <p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the nsWindow::OnExposeEvent function could
  allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5842">CVE-2012-5842</a>

  <p>Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine could
  allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory
  corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
  code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.11-1+squeeze15.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 10.0.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
