<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker, an issue
tracking system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4730">CVE-2012-4730</a>

	<p>Authenticated users can add arbitrary headers or content to
	mail generated by RT.	</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4732">CVE-2012-4732</a>

	<p>A CSRF vulnerability may allow attackers to toggle ticket
	bookmarks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4734">CVE-2012-4734</a>

	<p>If users follow a crafted URI and log in to RT, they may
	trigger actions which would ordinarily blocked by the CSRF
	prevention logic.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4735">CVE-2012-4735</a>

	<p>Several different vulnerabilities in GnuPG processing allow
	attackers to cause RT to improperly sign outgoing email.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4884">CVE-2012-4884</a>

	<p>If GnuPG support is enabled, authenticated users attackers can
	create arbitrary files as the web server user, which may
	enable arbitrary code execution.</p>

	<p>Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
	server, you must stop and start Apache manually.  The "restart"
	mechanism is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-2 of the request-tracker4 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.</p>
