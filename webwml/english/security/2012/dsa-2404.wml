<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nicolae Mogoraenu discovered a heap overflow in the emulated e1000e
network interface card of QEMU, which is used in the xen-qemu-dm-4.0
packages.  This vulnerability might enable to malicious guest systems
to crash the host system or escalate their privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (lenny) does not contain the
xen-qemu-dm-4.0 package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.1-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
will be fixed soon.</p>
