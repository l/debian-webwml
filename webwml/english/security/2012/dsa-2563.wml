<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in ViewVC, a web interface for CVS
and Subversion repositories.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-5024">CVE-2009-5024</a>:

    <p>Remote attackers can bypass the cvsdb row_limit
    configuration setting, and consequently conduct resource-consumption
    attacks via the limit parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3356">CVE-2012-3356</a>:

    <p>The remote SVN views functionality does not properly
    perform authorization, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended
    access restrictions.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3357">CVE-2012-3357</a>:

    <p>The SVN revision view does not properly handle log
    messages when a readable path is copied from an unreadable path, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4533">CVE-2012-4533</a>:

    <p>"function name" lines returned by diff are not properly
    escaped, allowing attackers with commit access to perform cross site
    scripting.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1.1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.5-1.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your viewvc packages.</p>
