<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ppm2tiff of the TIFF tools, a set of utilities
for TIFF manipulation and conversion, is not properly checking the return
value of an internal function used in order to detect integer overflows.
As a consequence, ppm2tiff suffers of a heap-based buffer overflow.
This allows attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code via a crafted
PPM image, especially in scenarios in which images are automatically
processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.9.4-5+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
