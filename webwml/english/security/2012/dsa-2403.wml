<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered that the implementation of the max_input_vars
configuration variable in a recent PHP security update was flawed such
that it allows remote attackers to crash PHP or potentially execute
code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.6.dfsg.1-1+lenny16.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
