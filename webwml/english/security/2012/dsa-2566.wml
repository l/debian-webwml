<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Exim, a mail transport agent, is not properly
handling the decoding of DNS records for DKIM.  Specifically, crafted
records can yield to a heap-based buffer overflow.  An attacker can
exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.72-6+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.80-5.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.80-5.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
