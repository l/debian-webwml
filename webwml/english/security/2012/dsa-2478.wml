<define-tag description>parsing error</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that sudo misparsed network masks used in Host and
Host_List stanzas. This allowed the execution of commands on hosts,
where the user would not be allowed to run the specified command.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.</p>
