<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Spring Framework contains an information
disclosure vulnerability in the processing of certain Expression
Language (EL) patterns, allowing attackers to access sensitive
information using HTTP requests.</p>

<p>NOTE: This update adds a springJspExpressionSupport context parameter
which must be manually set to false when the Spring Framework runs
under a container which provides EL support itself.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.6.SEC02-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-2.5-java packages.</p>
