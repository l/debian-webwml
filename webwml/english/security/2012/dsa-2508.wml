<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Rafal Wojtczuk from Bromium discovered that FreeBSD wasn't handling correctly
uncanonical return addresses on Intel amd64 CPUs, allowing privilege escalation
to kernel for local users.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1+dfsg-8+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.3-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-8 packages.</p>
