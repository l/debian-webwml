<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nicolae Mogoraenu discovered a heap overflow in the emulated e1000e
network interface card of KVM, a solution for full virtualization on 
x86 hardware, which could result in denial of service or privilege
escalation.</p>

<p>This update also fixes a guest-triggerable memory corruption in 
VNC handling.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5+dfsg-5+squeeze8. </p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0+dfsg-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
