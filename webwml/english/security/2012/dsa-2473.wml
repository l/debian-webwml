<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tielei Wang discovered that OpenOffice.org does not allocate a large
enough memory region when processing a specially crafted JPEG object,
leading to a heap-based buffer overflow and potentially arbitrary code
execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2.1-11+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.4.5-1 of the
libreoffice package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openoffice.org packages.</p>
