<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in Kerberos 5
crashes when processing certain crafted requests:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1528">CVE-2011-1528</a>

	<p>When the LDAP backend is used, remote users can trigger
	a KDC daemon crash and denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-1529">CVE-2011-1529</a>

	<p>When the LDAP or Berkeley DB backend is used, remote users
	can trigger a NULL pointer dereference in the KDC daemon
	and a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (lenny) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.10+dfsg~alpha1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
