<define-tag description>SQL injection</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Zabbix, a network monitoring solution, does not
properly validate user input used as a part of an SQL query. This may
allow unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands (SQL
injection) and possibly escalate privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.8.2-1squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.0.2+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.</p>
