<define-tag description>stack-based buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Warns discovered that the EAP-TLS handling of FreeRADIUS, a
high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server, is not properly
performing length checks on user-supplied input before copying to a local
stack buffer.  As a result, an unauthenticated attacker can exploit this
flaw to crash the daemon or execute arbitrary code via crafted
certificates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.10+dfsg-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.12+dfsg-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius packages.</p>
