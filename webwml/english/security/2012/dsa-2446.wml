<define-tag description>incorrect memory handling</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that incorrect memory handling in the png_set_text2()
function of the PNG library could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version libpng_1.2.44-1+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
