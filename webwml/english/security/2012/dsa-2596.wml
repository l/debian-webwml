<p>Thorsten Glaser discovered that the RSSReader extension for MediaWiki, a
website engine for collaborative work, does not properly escape tags in
feeds. This could allow a malicious feed to inject JavaScript into the
MediaWiki pages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki-extensions packages.</p>
