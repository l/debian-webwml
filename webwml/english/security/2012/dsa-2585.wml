<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in bogofilter, a software
package for classifying mail messages as spam or non-spam.  Crafted
mail messages with invalid base64 data could lead to heap corruption
and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.2+dfsg1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bogofilter packages.</p>
