<define-tag description>missing bounds checks</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The file type identification tool, file, and its associated library,
libmagic, do not properly process malformed files in the Composite
Document File (CDF) format, leading to crashes.</p>

<p>Note that after this update, file may return different detection
results for CDF files (well-formed or not).  The new detections are
believed to be more accurate.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.04-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.</p>
