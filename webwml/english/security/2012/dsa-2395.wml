<p>Laurent Butti discovered a buffer underflow in the LANalyzer dissector
of the Wireshark network traffic analyzer, which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code (<a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0068">CVE-2012-0068</a>).
</p>

<p>This update also addresses several bugs, which can lead to crashes of
Wireshark. These are not treated as security issues, but are fixed
nonetheless if security updates are scheduled: <a

<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-0067">CVE-2012-0067</a>.
