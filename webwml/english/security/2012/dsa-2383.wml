<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Robert Luberda discovered a buffer overflow in the syslog logging code of 
Super, a tool to execute scripts (or other commands) as if they were root.
The default Debian configuration is not affected.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-2+lenny1. Due to a technical limitation in the Debian
archive scripts this update cannot be released synchronously with the
stable update. It will be available shortly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.30.0-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your super packages.</p>
