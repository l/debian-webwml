<p>It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, hangs while constructing
the additional section of a DNS reply, when certain combinations of
resource records are present.  This vulnerability affects both
recursive and authoritative servers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
