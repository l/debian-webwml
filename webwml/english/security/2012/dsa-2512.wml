<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that the web server included in Mono performed
insufficient sanitising of requests, resulting in cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.7-5.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.8.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.</p>
