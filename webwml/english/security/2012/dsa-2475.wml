<define-tag description>integer underflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that openssl did not correctly handle explicit
Initialization Vectors for CBC encryption modes, as used in TLS 1.1,
1.2, and DTLS. An incorrect calculation would lead to an integer
underflow and incorrect memory access, causing denial of service
(application crash.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze13.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.1c-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
