<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web browser 
based on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides rendering services for 
several other applications included in Debian.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1948">CVE-2012-1948</a>

    <p>Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey
    identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the execution of 
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1950">CVE-2012-1950</a>

    <p>Mario Gomes and Code Audit Labs discovered that it is possible to force 
    Iceweasel to display the URL of the previous entered site through drag and 
    drop actions to the address bar. This can be abused to perform phishing 
    attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1954">CVE-2012-1954</a>

    <p>Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in 
    nsDocument::AdoptNode that may lead to the execution of arbitrary 
    code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1966">CVE-2012-1966</a>

    <p><q>moz_bug_r_a4</q> discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site
    scripting attacks through the context menu when using data: URLs.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1967">CVE-2012-1967</a>

    <p><q>moz_bug_r_a4</q> discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs can
    be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run
    with elevated privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Note: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian stable to 
consider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended Support Release) which 
is now available in Debian Backports. Although Debian will continue to support 
Iceweasel 3.5 in stable with security updates, this can only be done on a best 
effort basis as upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the 
10.0 branch adds proactive security features to the browser.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.16-17.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 10.0.6esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
