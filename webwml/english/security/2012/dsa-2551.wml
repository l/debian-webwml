<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Glen Eustace discovered that the ISC DHCP server, a server for automatic
IP address assignment, is not properly handling changes in the expiration
times of a lease.  An attacker may use this flaw to crash the service
and cause denial of service conditions, by reducing the expiration time
of an active IPv6 lease.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-P1-15+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.2.dfsg.1-5+deb70u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isc-dhcp packages.</p>
