OpenSSL, an implementation of TLS and related protocols.  A malicious
client can cause the DTLS server implementation to crash.  Regular,
TCP-based TLS is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny16.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze7.</p>
