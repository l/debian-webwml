<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Puppet, a centralized
configuration management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1906">CVE-2012-1906</a>

    <p>Puppet is using predictable temporary file names when downloading
    Mac OS X package files.  This allows a local attacker to either
    overwrite arbitrary files on the system or to install an arbitrary
    package.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1986">CVE-2012-1986</a>

    <p>When handling requests for a file from a remote filebucket, Puppet
    can be tricked into overwriting its defined location for filebucket
    storage.  This allows an authorized attacker with access to the Puppet
    master to read arbitrary files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1987">CVE-2012-1987</a>

    <p>Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket store requests.  This allows
    an attacker to perform denial of service attacks against Puppet by
    resource exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1988">CVE-2012-1988</a>

    <p>Puppet is incorrectly handling filebucket requests.  This allows an
    attacker with access to the certificate on the agent and an unprivileged
    account on Puppet master to execute arbitrary code via crafted file
    path names and making a filebucket request.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.13-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
