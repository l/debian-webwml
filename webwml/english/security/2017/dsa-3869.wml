<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that tnef, a tool used to unpack MIME attachments of
type "application/ms-tnef", did not correctly validate its input. An
attacker could exploit this by tricking a user into opening a
malicious attachment, which would result in a denial-of-service by
application crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.9-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.</p>
