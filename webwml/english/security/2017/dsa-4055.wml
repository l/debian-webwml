<p>Michael Eder and Thomas Kittel discovered that Heimdal, an
implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with MIT
Kerberos, did not correctly handle ASN.1 data. This would allow an
unauthenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (crash of
the KDC daemon) by sending maliciously crafted packets.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.1.0+dfsg-13+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of heimdal please refer to
its security tracker page at:
