<p>Marcin Noga discovered a buffer overflow in the JPEG loader of the GDK
Pixbuf library, which may result in the execution of arbitrary code if
a malformed file is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.31.1-2+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.36.5-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gdk-pixbuf packages.</p>
