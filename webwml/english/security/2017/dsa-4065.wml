<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3737">CVE-2017-3737</a>

    <p>David Benjamin of Google reported that OpenSSL does not properly
    handle SSL_read() and SSL_write() while being invoked in an error
    state, causing data to be passed without being decrypted or
    encrypted directly from the SSL/TLS record layer.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3738">CVE-2017-3738</a>

    <p>It was discovered that OpenSSL contains an overflow bug in the AVX2
    Montgomery multiplication procedure used in exponentiation with
    1024-bit moduli.</p>

<p>Details can be found in the upstream advisory:
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt">https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20171207.txt</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2l-2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl1.0 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of openssl1.0 please refer to its
