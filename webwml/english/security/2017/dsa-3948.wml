<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A read buffer overflow was discovered in the idtech3 (Quake III Arena)
family of game engines. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted packet.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.36+u20140802+gca9eebb-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.36+u20161101+dfsg1-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ioquake3 packages.</p>
