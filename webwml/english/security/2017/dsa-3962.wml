<p>A denial of service vulnerability was identified in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec
suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.</p>

<p>The gmp plugin in strongSwan had insufficient input validation when verifying
RSA signatures. This coding error could lead to a null pointer dereference,
leading to process crash.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.2.1-6+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.6.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
