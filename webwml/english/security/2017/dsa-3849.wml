<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in kde4libs, the core libraries
for all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6410">CVE-2017-6410</a>

    <p>Itzik Kotler, Yonatan Fridburg and Amit Klein of Safebreach Labs
    reported that URLs are not sanitized before passing them to
    FindProxyForURL, potentially allowing a remote attacker to obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8422">CVE-2017-8422</a>

    <p>Sebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that the KAuth framework
    contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking dbus is not
    properly checked. This flaw allows spoofing the identity of the
    caller and gaining root privileges from an unprivileged account.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.14.2-5+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.14.26-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.</p>
