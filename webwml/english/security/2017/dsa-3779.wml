<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They would allow remote attackers to hijack victims'
credentials, access sensitive information, execute arbitrary commands,
bypass read and post restrictions, or mount denial-of-service attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u12.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 4.7.1+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
