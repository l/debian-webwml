<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in rsync, a fast, versatile,
remote (and local) file-copying tool, allowing a remote attacker to
bypass intended access restrictions or cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.1.1-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.2-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rsync packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of rsync please refer to its security
tracker page at: <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rsync">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/rsync</a></p>
