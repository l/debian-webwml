<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that jhead, a tool to manipulate the non-image part of
EXIF compliant JPEG files, is prone to an out-of-bounds access
vulnerability, which may result in denial of service or, potentially,
the execution of arbitrary code if an image with specially crafted EXIF
data is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.97-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 1:3.00-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.00-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jhead packages.</p>
