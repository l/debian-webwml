<p>Francesco Sirocco discovered a flaw in otrs2, the Open Ticket Request
System, which could result in session information disclosure when cookie
support is disabled. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
to take over an agent's session if the agent is tricked into clicking a
link in a specially crafted mail.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.3.18-1+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.16-1+deb9u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of otrs2 please refer to its security
tracker page at: <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/otrs2">https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/otrs2</a></p>
