<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Exim, a mail transport
agent. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16943">CVE-2017-16943</a>

    <p>A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Exim's routines
    responsible for parsing mail headers. A remote attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Exim to crash, resulting in a denial
    of service, or potentially for remote code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16944">CVE-2017-16944</a>

    <p>It was discovered that Exim does not properly handle BDAT data
    headers allowing a remote attacker to cause Exim to crash, resulting
    in a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.89-2+deb9u2. Default installations disable advertising the
ESMTP CHUNKING extension and are not affected by these issues.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
