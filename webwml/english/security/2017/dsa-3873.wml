<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The cPanel Security Team reported a time of check to time of use
(TOCTTOU) race condition flaw in File::Path, a core module from Perl to
create or remove directory trees. An attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to set the mode on an attacker-chosen file to a attacker-chosen
value.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.20.2-3+deb8u7.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 5.24.1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.24.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
