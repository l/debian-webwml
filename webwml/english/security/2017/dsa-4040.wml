<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update fixes several vulnerabilities in imagemagick: Various memory
handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitising
may result in denial of service, memory disclosure or the execution of
arbitrary code if malformed image files are processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
