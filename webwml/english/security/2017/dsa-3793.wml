<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the shadow suite. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6252">CVE-2016-6252</a>

    <p>An integer overflow vulnerability was discovered, potentially
    allowing a local user to escalate privileges via crafted input to
    the newuidmap utility.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2616">CVE-2017-2616</a>

    <p>Tobias Stoeckmann discovered that su does not properly handle
    clearing a child PID. A local attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to send SIGKILL to other processes with root privileges,
    resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2-3+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your shadow packages.</p>
