<p>Hubert Kario discovered that GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and
SSL protocols, does not properly decode a status response TLS extension,
allowing a remote attacker to cause an application using the GnuTLS
library to crash (denial of service).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-6+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 3.5.8-5+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.8-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.</p>
