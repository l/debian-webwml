<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer
overflows and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, denial of service, bypass of the same-origin policy or
incorrect enforcement of CSP.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.3.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.3.0esr-1~deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.</p>
