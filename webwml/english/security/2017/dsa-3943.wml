<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gajim, a GTK+-based XMPP/Jabber client, unconditionally implements the
"XEP-0146: Remote Controlling Clients" extension, allowing a malicious
XMPP server to trigger commands to leak private conversations from
encrypted sessions. With this update XEP-0146 support has been disabled
by default and made opt-in via the <q>remote_commands</q> option.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.16-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed prior
to the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gajim packages.</p>
