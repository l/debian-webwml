<p>Ibrahim M. El-Sayed discovered an out-of-bounds heap read vulnerability
in the function Type_MLU_Read in lcms2, the Little CMS 2 color
management library, which can be triggered by an image with a specially
crafted ICC profile and leading to a heap memory leak or
denial-of-service for applications using the lcms2 library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.8-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lcms2 packages.</p>
