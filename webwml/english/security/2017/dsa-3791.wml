<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or have other
impacts.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6786">CVE-2016-6786</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6787">CVE-2016-6787</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the performance events subsystem does not
    properly manage locks during certain migrations, allowing a local
    attacker to escalate privileges.  This can be mitigated by
    disabling unprivileged use of performance events:
    <code>sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8405">CVE-2016-8405</a>

    <p>Peter Pi of Trend Micro discovered that the frame buffer video
    subsystem does not properly check bounds while copying color maps to
    userspace, causing a heap buffer out-of-bounds read, leading to
    information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9191">CVE-2016-9191</a>

    <p>CAI Qian discovered that reference counting is not properly handled
    within proc_sys_readdir in the sysctl implementation, allowing a
    local denial of service (system hang) or possibly privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2583">CVE-2017-2583</a>

    <p>Xiaohan Zhang reported that KVM for amd64 does not correctly
    emulate loading of a null stack selector.  This can be used by a
    user in a guest VM for denial of service (on an Intel CPU) or to
    escalate privileges within the VM (on an AMD CPU).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2584">CVE-2017-2584</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM for x86 does not correctly emulate
    memory access by the SGDT and SIDT instructions, which can result
    in a use-after-free and information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2596">CVE-2017-2596</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that KVM leaks page references when
    emulating a VMON for a nested hypervisor.  This can be used by a
    privileged user in a guest VM for denial of service or possibly
    to gain privileges in the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-2618">CVE-2017-2618</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an off-by-one in the handling of SELinux
    attributes in /proc/pid/attr could result in local denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5549">CVE-2017-5549</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the KLSI KL5KUSB105 serial USB device
    driver could log the contents of uninitialised kernel memory,
    resulting in an information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5551">CVE-2017-5551</a>

    <p>Jan Kara found that changing the POSIX ACL of a file on tmpfs never
    cleared its set-group-ID flag, which should be done if the user
    changing it is not a member of the group-owner. In some cases, this
    would allow the user-owner of an executable to gain the privileges
    of the group-owner.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5897">CVE-2017-5897</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov discovered an out-of-bounds read flaw in the
    ip6gre_err function in the IPv6 networking code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5970">CVE-2017-5970</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov discovered a denial-of-service flaw in the IPv4
    networking code.  This can be triggered by a local or remote
    attacker if a local UDP or raw socket has the IP_RETOPTS option
    enabled.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6001">CVE-2017-6001</a>

    <p>Di Shen discovered a race condition between concurrent calls to
    the performance events subsystem, allowing a local attacker to
    escalate privileges. This flaw exists because of an incomplete fix
    of <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-6786">CVE-2016-6786</a>.
    This can be mitigated by disabling unprivileged use of performance
    events: <code>sysctl kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3</code></p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-6074">CVE-2017-6074</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the
    DCCP networking code, which could result in denial of service or
    local privilege escalation.  On systems that do not already have
    the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated by disabling it:
    <code>echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false</code></p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.39-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
