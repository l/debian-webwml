<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libvncserver, a collection of libraries used to
implement VNC/RFB clients and servers, incorrectly processed incoming
network packets. This resulted in several heap-based buffer overflows,
allowing a rogue server to either cause a DoS by crashing the client,
or potentially execute arbitrary code on the client side.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.9+dfsg2-6.1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 0.9.11+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvncserver packages.</p>
