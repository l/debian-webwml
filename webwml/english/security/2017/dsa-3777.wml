<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation, which may result in
denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed file is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.2.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
