<p>Timo Schmid of ERNW GmbH discovered that the Git git-shell, a restricted
login shell for Git-only SSH access, allows a user to run an interactive
pager by causing it to spawn "git upload-pack --help".</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.11.0-3.</p>
