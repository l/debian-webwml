<p>Han Han of Red Hat discovered that augeas, a configuration editing
tool, improperly handled some escaped strings. A remote attacker could
leverage this flaw by sending maliciously crafted strings, thus
causing an augeas-enabled application to crash or potentially execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.0-0.2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.0-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your augeas packages.</p>
