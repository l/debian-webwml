<p>Jens Mueller discovered that an incorrect regular expression in rack-cors
may lead to insufficient restriction of CORS requests.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.0-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-rack-cors packages.</p>
