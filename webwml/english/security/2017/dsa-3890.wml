<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Emeric Boit of ANSSI reported that SPIP, a website engine for
publishing, insufficiently sanitises the value from the X-Forwarded-Host
HTTP header field. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of
this flaw to cause remote code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.4-3~deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.4-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spip packages.</p>
