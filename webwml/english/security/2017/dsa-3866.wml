<p>Two denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an
IKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9022">CVE-2017-9022</a>

    <p>RSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently
    before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might
    lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.
    A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer
    could be used for a denial-of-service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9023">CVE-2017-9023</a>

    <p>ASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when
    parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could
    lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted
    certificate.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>A fix for a build failure was additionally included in the 5.2.1-6+deb8u4
revision of the strongSwan package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.2.1-6+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 5.5.1-4</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
