<p>Dawid Golunski and Filippo Cavallarin discovered that squirrelmail, a
webmail application, incorrectly handled a user-supplied value. This
would allow a logged-in user to run arbitrary commands on the server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.</p>
