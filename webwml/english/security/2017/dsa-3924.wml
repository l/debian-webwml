<p>A denial of service vulnerability was discovered in Varnish, a state of
the art, high-performance web accelerator. Specially crafted HTTP
requests can cause the Varnish daemon to assert and restart, clearing
the cache in the process.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001.html">https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00001.html</a> for details.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.0.2-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.0-7+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.</p>
