<p>Guido Vranken discovered that incorrect memory management in libtirpc,
a transport-independent RPC library used by rpcbind and other programs
may result in denial of service via memory exhaustion (depending on
memory management settings).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5-1+deb8u1 of libtirpc and version 0.2.1-6+deb8u2 of rpcbind.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.2.5-1.2 and version 0.2.3-0.6 of rpcbind.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5-1.2 and version 0.2.3-0.6 of rpcbind.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtirpc packages.</p>
