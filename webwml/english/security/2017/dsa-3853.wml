<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that bitlbee, an IRC to other chat networks gateway,
contained issues that allowed a remote attacker to cause a denial of
service (via application crash), or potentially execute arbitrary
commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 3.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bitlbee packages.</p>
