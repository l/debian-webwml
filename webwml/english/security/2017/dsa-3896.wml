<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3167">CVE-2017-3167</a>

    <p>Emmanuel Dreyfus reported that the use of ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by
    third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to
    authentication requirements being bypassed.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3169">CVE-2017-3169</a>

    <p>Vasileios Panopoulos of AdNovum Informatik AG discovered that
    mod_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call
    ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port
    leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7659">CVE-2017-7659</a>

    <p>Robert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP/2 request
    could cause mod_http2 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the
    server process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7668">CVE-2017-7668</a>

    <p>Javier Jimenez reported that the HTTP strict parsing contains a
    flaw leading to a buffer overread in ap_find_token(). A remote
    attacker can take advantage of this flaw by carefully crafting a
    sequence of request headers to cause a segmentation fault, or to
    force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7679">CVE-2017-7679</a>

    <p>ChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod_mime can read one byte
    past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type
    response header.</p></li>
