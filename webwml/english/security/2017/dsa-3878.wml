<p>Agostino Sarubbo discovered multiple vulnerabilities in zziplib, a
library to access Zip archives, which could result in denial of service
and potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed archive
is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13.62-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.13.62-3.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.13.62-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zziplib packages.</p>
