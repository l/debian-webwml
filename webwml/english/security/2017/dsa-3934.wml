<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joern Schneeweisz discovered that git, a distributed revision control
system, did not correctly handle maliciously constructed ssh://
URLs. This allowed an attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for
instance via git submodules.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.</p>
