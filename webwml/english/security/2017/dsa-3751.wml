<p>A stack overflow vulnerability was discovered within the
gdImageFillToBorder function in libgd2, a library for programmatic
graphics creation and manipulation, triggered when invalid colors are
used with truecolor images. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to cause a denial-of-service against an application using the
libgd2 library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5+deb8u8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2.2-29-g3c2b605-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-29-g3c2b605-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
