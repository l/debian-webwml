<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0898">CVE-2017-0898</a>

    <p>aerodudrizzt reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the sprintf
    method of the Kernel module resulting in heap memory corruption or
    information disclosure from the heap.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0903">CVE-2017-0903</a>

    <p>Max Justicz reported that RubyGems is prone to an unsafe object
    deserialization vulnerability. When parsed by an application which
    processes gems, a specially crafted YAML formatted gem specification
    can lead to remote code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10784">CVE-2017-10784</a>

    <p>Yusuke Endoh discovered an escape sequence injection vulnerability
    in the Basic authentication of WEBrick. An attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to inject malicious escape sequences to the
    WEBrick log and potentially execute control characters on the
    victim's terminal emulator when reading logs.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14033">CVE-2017-14033</a>

    <p>asac reported a buffer underrun vulnerability in the OpenSSL
    extension. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to
    cause the Ruby interpreter to crash leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby2.3 packages.</p>
