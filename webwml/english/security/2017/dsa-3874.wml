<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Agostino Sarubbo and AromalUllas discovered that ettercap, a network
security tool for traffic interception, contains vulnerabilities that
allowed an attacker able to provide maliciously crafted filters to
cause a denial-of-service via application crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.1-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 1:0.8.2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ettercap packages.</p>
