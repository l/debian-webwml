<p>Calum Hutton reported that the XML-RPC server in supervisor, a system
for controlling process state, does not perform validation on requested
XML-RPC methods, allowing an authenticated client to send a malicious
XML-RPC request to supervisord that will run arbitrary shell commands on
the server as the same user as supervisord.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been fixed by disabling nested namespace lookup
entirely. supervisord will now only call methods on the object
registered to handle XML-RPC requests and not any child objects it may
contain, possibly breaking existing setups. No publicly available
plugins are currently known that use nested namespaces. Plugins that use
a single namespace will continue to work as before. Details can be found
on the upstream issue at
<a href="https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964">https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964</a> .</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.0r1-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.1-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your supervisor packages.</p>
