<p>Michal Marek discovered that ruby-archive-tar-minitar, a Ruby library
that provides the ability to deal with POSIX tar archive files, is prone
to a directory traversal vulnerability. An attacker can take advantage
of this flaw to overwrite arbitrary files during archive extraction via
a .. (dot dot) in an extracted filename.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-archive-tar-minitar packages.</p>
