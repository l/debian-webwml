<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in tomcat8, a servlet and JSP
engine.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5647">CVE-2017-5647</a>

  <p>Pipelined requests were processed incorrectly, which could result in
  some responses appearing to be sent for the wrong request.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5648">CVE-2017-5648</a>

  <p>Some application listeners calls were issued against the wrong
  objects, allowing untrusted applications running under a
  SecurityManager to bypass that protection mechanism and access or
  modify information associated with other web applications.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.0.14-1+deb8u9.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 8.5.11-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.</p>
