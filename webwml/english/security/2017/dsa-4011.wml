<p>It was discovered that the bgpd daemon in the Quagga routing suite does
not properly calculate the length of multi-segment AS_PATH UPDATE
messages, causing bgpd to drop a session and potentially resulting in
loss of network connectivity.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.99.23.1-1+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga packages.</p>
