<p>It was discovered that jabberd2, a Jabber instant messenger server,
allowed anonymous SASL connections, even if disabled in the
configuration.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.0-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jabberd2 packages.</p>
