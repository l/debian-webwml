<p>Stevie Trujillo discovered a local file write vulnerability in munin, a
network-wide graphing framework, when CGI graphs are enabled. GET
parameters are not properly handled, allowing to inject options into
munin-cgi-graph and overwriting any file accessible by the user
running the cgi-process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.25-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your munin packages.</p>
