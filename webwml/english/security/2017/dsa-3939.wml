<p>Aleksandar Nikolic discovered that an error in the x509 parser of the
Botan crypto library could result in an out-of-bounds memory read,
resulting in denial of service or an information leak if processing
a malformed certificate.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.10.8-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
prior to the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your botan1.10 packages.</p>
