<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in GIMP, the GNU Image
Manipulation Program, which could result in denial of service
(application crash) or potentially the execution of arbitrary code if
malformed files are opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.14-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.18-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gimp packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of gimp please refer to its security
tracker page at:
