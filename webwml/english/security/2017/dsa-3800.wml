<p>Marco Romano discovered that libquicktime, a library for reading and
writing QuickTime files, was vulnerable to an integer overflow
attack. When opened, a specially crafted MP4 file would cause a denial
of service by crashing the application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.2.4-7+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.2.4-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libquicktime packages.</p>
