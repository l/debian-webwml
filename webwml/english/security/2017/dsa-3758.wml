<p>Several denial-of-service vulnerabilities (assertion failures) were
discovered in BIND, a DNS server implementation.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9131">CVE-2016-9131</a>

    <p>A crafted upstream response to an ANY query could cause an
    assertion failure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9147">CVE-2016-9147</a>

    <p>A crafted upstream response with self-contradicting DNSSEC data
    could cause an assertion failure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-9444">CVE-2016-9444</a>

    <p>Specially-crafted upstream responses with a DS record could cause
    an assertion failure.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>These vulnerabilities predominantly affect DNS servers providing
recursive service.  Client queries to authoritative-only servers
cannot trigger these assertion failures.  These vulnerabilities are
present whether or not DNSSEC validation is enabled in the server
configuration.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
