<p>Cl√©ment Berthaux from Synaktiv discovered two vulnerabilities in BIND, a DNS
server implementation. They allow an attacker to bypass TSIG authentication by
sending crafted DNS packets to a server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3142">CVE-2017-3142</a>

    <p>An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name may be able to
    circumvent TSIG authentication of AXFR requests via a carefully constructed
    request packet. A server that relies solely on TSIG keys for protection
    with no other ACL protection could be manipulated into:
	</p>
	<ul>
    <li>providing an AXFR of a zone to an unauthorized recipient</li>
    <li>accepting bogus NOTIFY packets</li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3143">CVE-2017-3143</a>

    <p>An attacker who is able to send and receive messages to an authoritative
    DNS server and who has knowledge of a valid TSIG key name for the zone and
    service being targeted may be able to manipulate BIND into accepting an
    unauthorized dynamic update. </p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u12.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
