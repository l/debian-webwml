<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the Graphite font rendering
engine which might result in denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code if a malformed font file is processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.10-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
prior to the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your graphite2 packages.</p>
