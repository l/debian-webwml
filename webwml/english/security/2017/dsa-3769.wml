<p>Dawid Golunski from LegalHackers discovered that PHP Swift Mailer, a
mailing solution for PHP, did not correctly validate user input. This
allowed a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by passing
specially formatted email addresses in specific email headers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.2-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 5.4.2-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-swiftmailer packages.</p>
