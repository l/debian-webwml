<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor, which
could result in denial of service, information leaks, privilege escalation
or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie) a separate update will be
released.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.2+xsa245-0+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
