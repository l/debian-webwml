<p>Matias P. Brutti discovered that python-pysaml2, a Python
implementation of the Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0, did not
correctly sanitize the XML messages it handled. This allowed a remote
attacker to perform XML External Entity attacks, leading to a wide
range of exploits.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, this
problem has been fixed in version 3.0.0-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-pysaml2 packages.</p>
