<p>Daniel Genkin, Luke Valenta and Yuval Yarom discovered that Libgcrypt
is prone to a local side-channel attack against the ECDH encryption with
Curve25519, allowing recovery of the private key.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.6-2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.9-1.</p>
