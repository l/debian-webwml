<p>Adam Collard discovered that Bazaar, an easy to use distributed version
control system, did not correctly handle maliciously constructed bzr+ssh
URLs, allowing a remote attacker to run an arbitrary shell command.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.6.0+bzr6595-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.0+bzr6619-7+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bzr packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of bzr please refer to its security
tracker page at:
