<p>Lilith Wyatt discovered two vulnerabilities in the Zabbix network
monitoring system which may result in execution of arbitrary code or
database writes by malicious proxies.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.2.7+dfsg-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
prior to the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zabbix packages.</p>
