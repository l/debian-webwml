<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that unrestricted YAML deserialisation of data sent
from agents to the server in the Puppet configuration management system
could result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Note that this fix breaks backward compability with Puppet agents older
than 3.2.2 and there is no safe way to restore it. This affects puppet
agents running on Debian wheezy; we recommend to update the the
puppet version shipped in wheezy-backports.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8.2-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
