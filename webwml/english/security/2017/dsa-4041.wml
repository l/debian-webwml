<p>Jakub Wilk reported a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in
procmail's formail utility when processing specially-crafted email
headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause formail to
crash, resulting in a denial of service or data loss.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.22-24+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22-25+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your procmail packages.</p>
