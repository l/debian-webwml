<p>Ryan Day discovered that the Simple Linux Utility for Resource
Management (SLURM), a cluster resource management and job scheduling
system, does not properly handle SPANK environment variables, allowing a
user permitted to submit jobs to execute code as root during the Prolog
or Epilog. All systems using a Prolog or Epilog script are vulnerable,
regardless of whether SPANK plugins are in use.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 16.05.9-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 17.02.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your slurm-llnl packages.</p>
