<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>joernchen discovered that the git-cvsserver subcommand of Git, a
distributed version control system, suffers from a shell command
injection vulnerability due to unsafe use of the Perl backtick
operator.  The git-cvsserver subcommand is reachable from the
git-shell subcommand even if CVS support has not been configured
(however, the git-cvs package needs to be installed).</p>

<p>In addition to fixing the actual bug, this update removes the
cvsserver subcommand from git-shell by default.  Refer to the updated
documentation for instructions how to reenable in case this CVS
functionality is still needed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.14.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.</p>
