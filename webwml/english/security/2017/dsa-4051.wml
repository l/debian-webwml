<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8816">CVE-2017-8816</a>

    <p>Alex Nichols discovered a buffer overrun flaw in the NTLM authentication
    code which can be triggered on 32bit systems where an integer overflow
    might occur when calculating the size of a memory allocation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8817">CVE-2017-8817</a>

    <p>Fuzzing by the OSS-Fuzz project led to the discovery of a read out of
    bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard function in libcurl. A malicious server
    could redirect a libcurl-based client to an URL using a wildcard pattern,
    triggering the out-of-bound read.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
