<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jann Horn of Google discovered a time-of-check, time-of-use race
condition in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix. A
malicious client can take advantage of this flaw by exploiting a symlink
race to access areas of the server file system not exported under a
share definition.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.5.6+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
