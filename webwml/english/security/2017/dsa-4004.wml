<p>Liao Xinxi discovered that jackson-databind, a Java library used to
parse JSON and other data formats, did not properly validate user
input before attemtping deserialization. This allowed an attacker to
perform code execution by providing maliciously crafted input.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.4.2-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jackson-databind packages.</p>
