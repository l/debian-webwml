<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML or HTML file that, when processed
by an application using libxml2, would cause a denial-of-service against
the application, information leaks, or potentially, the execution of
arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.4+dfsg1-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.</p>
