<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alvaro Munoz and Christian Schneider discovered that jython, an
implementation of the Python language seamlessly integrated with Java,
is prone to arbitrary code execution triggered when sending a serialized
function to the deserializer.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.5.3-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3-16+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3-17.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jython packages.</p>
