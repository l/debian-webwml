<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tobias Stoeckmann discovered that the libXpm library contained two
integer overflow flaws, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write, while
parsing XPM extensions in a file. An attacker can provide a specially
crafted XPM file that, when processed by an application using the libXpm
library, would cause a denial-of-service against the application, or
potentially, the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the
user running the application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.12-0+deb8u1. This update is based on a new upstream
version of libxpm including additional bug fixes.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:3.5.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxpm packages.</p>
