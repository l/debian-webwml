<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Frediano Ziglio discovered a buffer overflow in spice, a SPICE protocol
client and server library which may result in memory disclosure, denial
of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.12.5-1+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.8-2.1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.</p>
