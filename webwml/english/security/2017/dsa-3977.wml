<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that podbeuter, the podcast fetcher in newsbeuter, a
text-mode RSS feed reader, did not properly escape the name of the media
enclosure (the podcast file), allowing a remote attacker to run an
arbitrary shell command on the client machine. This is only exploitable
if the file is also played in podbeuter.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.8-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-5+deb9u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your newsbeuter packages.</p>
