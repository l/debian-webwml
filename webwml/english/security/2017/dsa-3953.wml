<p>Zane Bitter from Red Hat discovered a vulnerability in Aodh, the alarm
engine for OpenStack. Aodh does not verify that the user creating the
alarm is the trustor or has the same rights as the trustor, nor that the
trust is for the same project as the alarm. The bug allows that an
authenticated user without a Keystone token with knowledge of trust IDs
to perform unspecified authenticated actions by adding alarm actions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.0-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your aodh packages.</p>
