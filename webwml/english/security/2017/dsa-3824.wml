<p>George Noseevich discovered that firebird2.5, a relational database
system, did not properly check User-Defined Functions (UDF), thus
allowing remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code on the
firebird server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.</p>
