<p>George Shuklin from servers.com discovered that Nova, a cloud
computing fabric controller, did not correctly enforce its image- or
hosts-filters. This allowed an authenticated user to bypass those
filters by simply rebuilding an instance.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:14.0.0-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nova packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of nova please refer to
its security tracker page at:
