<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8824">CVE-2017-8824</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16538">CVE-2017-16538</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
    did not correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16644">CVE-2017-16644</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the hdpvr media driver did not
    correctly handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A
    physically present user with a specially designed USB device can
    use this to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16995">CVE-2017-16995</a>

    <p>Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
    correctly model the behaviour of 32-bit load instructions.  A
    local user can use this for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448">CVE-2017-17448</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
    just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
    helpers.  This could lead to denial of service, violation of
    network security policy, or have other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17449">CVE-2017-17449</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
    to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
    those owned by that user namespace.  This could lead to
    exposure of sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17450">CVE-2017-17450</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
    the global OS fingerprint list.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17558">CVE-2017-17558</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17712">CVE-2017-17712</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam discovered a race condition in the IPv4 raw socket
    implementation.  A local user could use this to obtain sensitive
    information from the kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17741">CVE-2017-17741</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17805">CVE-2017-17805</a>

    <p>It was discovered that some implementations of the Salsa20 block
    cipher did not correctly handle zero-length input.  A local user
    could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
    have other security impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17806">CVE-2017-17806</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17807">CVE-2017-17807</a>

    <p>Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17862">CVE-2017-17862</a>

    <p>Alexei Starovoitov discovered that the Extended BPF verifier
    ignored unreachable code, even though it would still be processed
    by JIT compilers.  This could possibly be used by local users for
    denial of service.  It also increases the severity of bugs in
    determining unreachable code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17863">CVE-2017-17863</a>

    <p>Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier did not
    correctly model pointer arithmetic on the stack frame pointer.
    A local user can use this for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17864">CVE-2017-17864</a>

    <p>Jann Horn discovered that the Extended BPF verifier could fail to
    detect pointer leaks from conditional code.  A local user could
    use this to obtain sensitive information in order to exploit
    other vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000407">CVE-2017-1000407</a>

    <p>Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000410">CVE-2017-1000410</a>

    <p>Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
    handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages.  An
    attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The various problems in the Extended BPF verifier can be mitigated by
disabling use of Extended BPF by unprivileged users:
sysctl kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</p>

<p>Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they
are enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448">\
CVE-2017-17448</a> can be exploited by any local user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.65-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
