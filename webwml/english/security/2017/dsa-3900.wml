<p>Several issues were discovered in openvpn, a virtual private network
application.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7479">CVE-2017-7479</a>

    <p>It was discovered that openvpn did not properly handle the
    rollover of packet identifiers. This would allow an authenticated
    remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application
    crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7508">CVE-2017-7508</a>

    <p>Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    specific malformed IPv6 packets. This would allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial-of-service via application crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7520">CVE-2017-7520</a>

    <p>Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    clients connecting to an HTTP proxy with NTLMv2
    authentication. This would allow a remote attacker to cause a
    denial-of-service via application crash, or potentially leak
    sensitive information like the user's proxy password.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7521">CVE-2017-7521</a>

    <p>Guido Vranken discovered that openvpn did not properly handle
    some x509 extensions. This would allow a remote attacker to cause
    a denial-of-service via application crash.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.3.4-5+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.0-6+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.4.3-1.</p>
