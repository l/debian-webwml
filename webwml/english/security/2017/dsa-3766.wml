<p>It was discovered that mapserver, a CGI-based framework for Internet
map services, was vulnerable to a stack-based overflow. This issue
allowed a remote user to crash the service, or potentially execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4.1-5+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.0.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.</p>
