<p>Multiple security issues have been discoverd in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12150">CVE-2017-12150</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher discovered multiple code paths where SMB signing
    was not enforced.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12151">CVE-2017-12151</a>

    <p>Stefan Metzmacher discovered that tools using libsmbclient did not
    enforce encryption when following DFS redirects, which could allow a
    man-in-the-middle attacker to read or modify connections which were
    meant to be encrypted.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12163">CVE-2017-12163</a>

    <p>Yihan Lian and Zhibin Hu discovered that insufficient range checks
    in the processing of SMB1 write requests could result in disclosure
    of server memory.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.5.8+dfsg-2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
