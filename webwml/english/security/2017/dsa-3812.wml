<p>It was discovered that ioquake3, a modified version of the ioQuake3 game
engine performs insufficent restrictions on automatically downloaded
content (pk3 files or game code), which allows malicious game servers to
modify configuration settings including driver settings.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.36+u20140802+gca9eebb-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.36+u20161101+dfsg1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ioquake3 packages.</p>
