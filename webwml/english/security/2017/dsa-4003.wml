<p>Daniel P. Berrange reported that Libvirt, a virtualisation abstraction
library, does not properly handle the default_tls_x509_verify (and
related) parameters in qemu.conf when setting up TLS clients and servers
in QEMU, resulting in TLS clients for character devices and disk devices
having verification turned off and ignoring any errors while validating
the server certificate.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.0-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.</p>
