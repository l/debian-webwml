<p>It was discovered that the Dovecot email server is vulnerable to a
denial of service attack. When the <q>dict</q> passdb and userdb are used
for user authentication, the username sent by the IMAP/POP3 client is
sent through var_expand() to perform %variable expansion. Sending
specially crafted %variable fields could result in excessive memory
usage causing the process to crash (and restart).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.2.13-12~deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dovecot packages.</p>
