<p>Jann Horn of Google Project Zero discovered that NTFS-3G, a read-write
NTFS driver for FUSE, does not scrub the environment before executing
modprobe with elevated privileges. A local user can take advantage of
this flaw for local root privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2014.2.15AR.2-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2016.2.22AR.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntfs-3g packages.</p>
