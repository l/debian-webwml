<p>Dave McDaniel discovered multiple vulnerabilities in rtmpdump, a small
dumper/library for RTMP media streams, which may result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed stream is
dumped.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4+20150115.gita107cef-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4+20151223.gitfa8646d.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rtmpdump packages.</p>
