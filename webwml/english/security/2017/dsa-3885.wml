<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9468">CVE-2017-9468</a>

    <p>Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle DCC
    messages without source nick/host. A malicious IRC server can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.</p></li>

    denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.17-1+deb8u4.</p>
