<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9940">CVE-2014-9940</a>

    <p>A use-after-free flaw in the voltage and current regulator driver
    could allow a local user to cause a denial of service or potentially
    escalate privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7346">CVE-2017-7346</a>

    <p>Li Qiang discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual GPUs does
    not properly check user-controlled values in the
    vmw_surface_define_ioctl() functions for upper limits. A local user
    can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7482">CVE-2017-7482</a>

    <p>Shi Lei discovered that RxRPC Kerberos 5 ticket handling code does
    not properly verify metadata, leading to information disclosure,
    denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7533">CVE-2017-7533</a>

    <p>Fan Wu and Shixiong Zhao discovered a race condition between inotify
    events and VFS rename operations allowing an unprivileged local
    attacker to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7541">CVE-2017-7541</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow flaw in the Broadcom IEEE802.11n PCIe SoftMAC WLAN
    driver could allow a local user to cause kernel memory corruption,
    leading to a denial of service or potentially privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7542">CVE-2017-7542</a>

    <p>An integer overflow vulnerability in the ip6_find_1stfragopt()
    function was found allowing a local attacker with privileges to open
    raw sockets to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7889">CVE-2017-7889</a>

    <p>Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler reported that the mm subsystem does
    not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism,
    allowing a local attacker with access to /dev/mem to obtain
    sensitive information or potentially execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9605">CVE-2017-9605</a>

    <p>Murray McAllister discovered that the DRM driver for VMware virtual
    GPUs does not properly initialize memory, potentially allowing a
    local attacker to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized
    kernel memory via a crafted ioctl call.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10911">CVE-2017-10911</a>

<p>/ XSA-216</p>

    <p>Anthony Perard of Citrix discovered an information leak flaw in Xen
    blkif response handling, allowing a malicious unprivileged guest to
    obtain sensitive information from the host or other guests.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11176">CVE-2017-11176</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the mq_notify() function does not set the
    sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. An attacker
    can take advantage of this flaw during a userspace close of a
    Netlink socket to cause a denial of service or potentially cause
    other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000363">CVE-2017-1000363</a>

    <p>Roee Hay reported that the lp driver does not properly bounds-check
    passed arguments, allowing a local attacker with write access to the
    kernel command line arguments to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000365">CVE-2017-1000365</a>

    <p>It was discovered that argument and environment pointers are not
    taken properly into account to the imposed size restrictions on
    arguments and environmental strings passed through
    RLIMIT_STACK/RLIMIT_INFINITY. A local attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw in conjunction with other flaws to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
