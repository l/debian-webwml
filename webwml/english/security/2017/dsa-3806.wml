<p>It was discovered a vulnerability in Pidgin, a multi-protocol instant
messaging client. A server controlled by an attacker can send an invalid
XML that can trigger an out-of-bound memory access. This might lead to a
crash or, in some extreme cases, to remote code execution in the
client-side.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11.0-0+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.</p>
