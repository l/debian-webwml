<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Zookeeper, a service for maintaining
configuration information, didn't restrict access to the computationally
expensive wchp/wchc commands which could result in denial of service by
elevated CPU consumption.</p>

<p>This update disables those two commands by default. The new
configuration option <q>4lw.commands.whitelist</q> can be used to whitelist
commands selectively (and the full set of commands can be restored
with '*')</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.5+dfsg-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zookeeper packages.</p>
