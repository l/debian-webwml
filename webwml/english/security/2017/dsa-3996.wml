<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FFmpeg multimedia
framework, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed Real, MV, RL2, ASF, Apple HLS,
Phantom Cine, MXF, NSV, MOV or RTP H.264 files/streams are processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:3.2.8-1~deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
