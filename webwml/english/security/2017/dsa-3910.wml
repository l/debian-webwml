<p>Cl√©ment Berthaux from Synaktiv discovered a signature forgery vulnerability in
knot, an authoritative-only DNS server. This vulnerability allows an attacker
to bypass TSIG authentication by sending crafted DNS packets to a server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.6.0-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.0-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (buster) and unstable (sid), this problem will be fixed
in a later update.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your knot packages.</p>
