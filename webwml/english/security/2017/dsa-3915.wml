<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ruby-mixlib-archive, a Chef Software's library
used to handle various archive formats, was vulnerable to a directory
traversal attack. This allowed attackers to overwrite arbitrary files
by using a malicious tar archive containing ".." in its entries.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.0-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-mixlib-archive packages.</p>
