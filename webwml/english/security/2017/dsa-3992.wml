<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000100">CVE-2017-1000100</a>

    <p>Even Rouault reported that cURL does not properly handle long file
    names when doing an TFTP upload. A malicious HTTP(S) server can take
    advantage of this flaw by redirecting a client using the cURL
    library to a crafted TFTP URL and trick it to send private memory
    contents to a remote server over UDP.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000101">CVE-2017-1000101</a>

    <p>Brian Carpenter and Yongji Ouyang reported that cURL contains a flaw
    in the globbing function that parses the numerical range, leading to
    an out-of-bounds read when parsing a specially crafted URL.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000254">CVE-2017-1000254</a>

    <p>Max Dymond reported that cURL contains an out-of-bounds read flaw in
    the FTP PWD response parser. A malicious server can take advantage
    of this flaw to effectively prevent a client using the cURL library
    to work with it, causing a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
