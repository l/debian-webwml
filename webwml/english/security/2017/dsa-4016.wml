<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Irssi, a terminal based
IRC client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10965">CVE-2017-10965</a>

    <p>Brian <q>geeknik</q> Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi does
    not properly handle receiving messages with invalid time stamps. A
    malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi
    to crash, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10966">CVE-2017-10966</a>

    <p>Brian <q>geeknik</q> Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that Irssi is
    susceptible to a use-after-free flaw triggered while updating the
    internal nick list. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15227">CVE-2017-15227</a>

    <p>Joseph Bisch discovered that while waiting for the channel
    synchronisation, Irssi may incorrectly fail to remove destroyed
    channels from the query list, resulting in use after free conditions
    when updating the state later on. A malicious IRC server can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15228">CVE-2017-15228</a>

    <p>Hanno Boeck reported that Irssi does not properly handle installing
    themes with unterminated colour formatting sequences, leading to a
    denial of service if a user is tricked into installing a specially
    crafted theme.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15721">CVE-2017-15721</a>

    <p>Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly handle
    incorrectly formatted DCC CTCP messages. A remote attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15722">CVE-2017-15722</a>

    <p>Joseph Bisch discovered that Irssi does not properly verify Safe
    channel IDs. A malicious IRC server can take advantage of this flaw
    to cause Irssi to crash, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15723">CVE-2017-15723</a>

    <p>Joseph Bisch reported that Irssi does not properly handle overlong
    nicks or targets resulting in a NULL pointer dereference when
    splitting the message and leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.8.17-1+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+deb9u3. <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10965">CVE-2017-10965</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-10966">CVE-2017-10966</a> were already
fixed in an earlier point release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your irssi packages.</p>
