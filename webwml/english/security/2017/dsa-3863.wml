<p>This update fixes several vulnerabilities in imagemagick: Various memory
handling problems and cases of missing or incomplete input sanitising
may result in denial of service, memory disclosure or the execution of
arbitrary code if malformed RLE, ART, JNG, DDS, BMP, ICO, EPT, SUN, MTV,
PICT, XWD, PCD, SFW, MAT, EXR, DCM, MNG, PCX or SVG files are processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.8.9.9-5+deb8u9.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 8:6.9.7.4+dfsg-8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
