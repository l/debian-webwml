<p>It was discovered that libpam4j, a Java library wrapper for the
integration of PAM did not call pam_acct_mgmt() during authentication.
As such a user who has a valid password, but a deactivated or disabled
account could still log in.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam4j packages.</p>
