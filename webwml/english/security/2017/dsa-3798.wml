<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Sesterhenn, from X41 D-Sec GmbH, discovered several
vulnerabilities in tnef, a tool used to unpack MIME attachments of
type <q>application/ms-tnef</q>. Multiple heap overflows, type confusions
and out of bound reads and writes could be exploited by tricking a
user into opening a malicious attachment. This would result in denial
of service via application crash, or potential arbitrary code
execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tnef packages.</p>
