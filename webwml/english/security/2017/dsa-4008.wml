<p>Antti Levomaeki, Christian Jalio, Joonas Pihlaja and Juhani Eronen
discovered two buffer overflows in the HTTP protocol handler of the Wget
download tool, which could result in the execution of arbitrary code
when connecting to a malicious HTTP server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.16-1+deb8u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.18-5+deb9u1.</p>
