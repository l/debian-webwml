<p>Toshifumi Sakaguchi discovered that PowerDNS Recursor, a high-performance
resolving name server was susceptible to denial of service via a crafted
CNAME answer.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (jessie) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.4-1+deb9u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of pdns-recursor please refer to
