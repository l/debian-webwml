<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead
to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.</p>

<p>Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Thunderbird.
Support for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update
we're now following the 52.x releases.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:52.2.1-4~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:52.2.1-4~deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
