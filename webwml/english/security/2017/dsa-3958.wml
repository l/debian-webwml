<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that FontForge, a font editor, did not correctly
validate its input. An attacker could use this flaw by tricking a user
into opening a maliciously crafted OpenType font file, thus causing a
denial-of-service via application crash, or execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 20120731.b-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:20161005~dfsg-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fontforge packages.</p>
