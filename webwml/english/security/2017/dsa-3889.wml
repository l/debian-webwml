<p>libffi, a library used to call code written in one language from code written
in a different language, was enforcing an executable stack on the i386
architecture. While this might not be considered a vulnerability by itself,
this could be leveraged when exploiting other vulnerabilities, like for example
the <q>stack clash</q> class of vulnerabilities discovered by Qualys Research Labs.
For the full details, please refer to their advisory published at:
<a href="https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt">https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt</a></p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.2.1-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libffi packages.</p>
