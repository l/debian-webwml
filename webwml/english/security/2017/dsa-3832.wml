<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or information leaks.</p>

<p>With this update, the Icedove packages are de-branded back to the official
Mozilla branding. With the removing of the Debian branding the packages
are also renamed back to the official names used by Mozilla.</p>

<p>The Thunderbird package is using a different default profile folder,
the default profile folder is now <code>'\$(HOME)/.thunderbird'</code>.
The users profile folder, that was used in Icedove, will get migrated
to the new profile folder on the first start, that can take a little bit
more time.</p>

<p>Please read README.Debian for getting more information about the
changes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:45.8.0-3~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
