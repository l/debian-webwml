<p>It was discovered that CVS, a centralised version control system, did
not correctly handle maliciously constructed repository URLs, which
allowed an attacker to run an arbitrary shell command.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:1.12.13+real-15+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.13+real-22+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvs packages.</p>
