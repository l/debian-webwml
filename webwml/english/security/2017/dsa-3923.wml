<p>Tyler Bohan of Talos discovered that FreeRDP, a free implementation of
the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), contained several vulnerabilities
that allowed a malicious remote server or a man-in-the-middle to
either cause a DoS by forcibly terminating the client, or execute
arbitrary code on the client side.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.0~git20140921.1.440916e+dfsg1-4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0~git20140921.1.440916e+dfsg1-13+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0~git20140921.1.440916e+dfsg1-14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freerdp packages.</p>
