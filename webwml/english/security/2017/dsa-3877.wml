<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that Tor, a connection-based low-latency
anonymous communication system, contain a flaw in the hidden service
code when receiving a BEGIN_DIR cell on a hidden service rendezvous
circuit. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
hidden service to crash with an assertion failure (TROVE-2017-005).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5.14-1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), this problem will be
fixed in version 0.2.9.11-1~deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.9.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
