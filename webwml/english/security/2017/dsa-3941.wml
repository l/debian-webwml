<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A read buffer overflow was discovered in the idtech3 (Quake III Arena)
family of game engines. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial
of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact
via a crafted packet.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.50a+dfsg1-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iortcw packages.</p>
