<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in VLC, the VideoLAN project's
media player. Processing malformed subtitles or movie files could lead
to denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.6-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
