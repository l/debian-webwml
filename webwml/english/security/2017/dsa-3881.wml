<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web
browser: Multiple memory safety errors, use-after-frees, buffer overflows
and other implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code, denial of service or domain spoofing.</p>

<p>Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 45.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 52.x releases.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (stretch), these problems will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.2.0esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-esr packages.</p>
