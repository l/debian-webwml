<p>Ilja Van Sprundel discovered that the dmcrypt-get-device helper used to
check if a given device is an encrypted device handled by devmapper, and
used in eject, does not check return values from setuid() and setgid()
when dropping privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5+deb1+cvs20081104-13.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eject packages.</p>
