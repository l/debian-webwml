<p>Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in libsoup2.4, a HTTP library implementation in
C. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw by sending a
specially crafted HTTP request to cause an application using the
libsoup2.4 library to crash (denial of service), or potentially execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.48.0-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.56.0-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsoup2.4 packages.</p>
