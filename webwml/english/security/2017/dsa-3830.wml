<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that icu, the International Components for Unicode
library, did not correctly validate its input. An attacker could use
this problem to trigger an out-of-bound write through a heap-based
buffer overflow, thus causing a denial of service via application
crash, or potential execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions,
these problems have been fixed in version 57.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.</p>
