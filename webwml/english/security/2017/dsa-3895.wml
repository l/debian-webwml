<p>It was discovered that Flatpak, an application deployment framework for
desktop apps insufficiently restricted file permissinons in third-party
repositories, which could result in privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flatpak packages.</p>
