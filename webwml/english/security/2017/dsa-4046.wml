<p>Tobias Schneider discovered that libspring-ldap-java, a Java library
for Spring-based applications using the Lightweight Directory Access
Protocol, would under some circumstances allow authentication with a
correct username but an arbitrary password.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.1.RELEASE-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libspring-ldap-java packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libspring-ldap-java please refer to
its security tracker page at:
