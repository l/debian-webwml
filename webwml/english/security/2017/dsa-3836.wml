<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that weechat, a fast and light chat client, is prone
to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the IRC plugin, allowing a remote
attacker to cause a denial-of-service by sending a specially crafted
filename via DCC.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your weechat packages.</p>
