<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libtiff library
and the included tools tiff2rgba, rgb2ycbcr, tiffcp, tiffcrop, tiff2pdf
and tiffsplit, which may result in denial of service, memory disclosure
or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>There were additional vulnerabilities in the tools bmp2tiff, gif2tiff,
thumbnail and ras2tiff, but since these were addressed by the libtiff
developers by removing the tools altogether, no patches are available
and those tools were also removed from the tiff package in Debian
stable. The change had already been made in Debian stretch before and
no applications included in Debian are known to rely on these scripts.
If you use those tools in custom setups, consider using a different
conversion/thumbnailing tool.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.3-12.3+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.7-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
