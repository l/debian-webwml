<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Felix Wilhelm discovered that the Evince document viewer made insecure
use of tar when opening tar comic book archives (CBT). Opening a
malicious CBT archive could result in the execution of arbitrary code.
This update disables the CBT format entirely.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.14.1-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.1-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your evince packages.</p>
