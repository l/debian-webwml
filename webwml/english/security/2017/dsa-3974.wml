<p>Two issues were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7674">CVE-2017-7674</a>

    <p>Rick Riemer discovered that the Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
    filter did not add a Vary header indicating possible different
    responses, which could lead to cache poisoning.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7675">CVE-2017-7675</a> (stretch only)

    <p>Markus DÃ¶rschmidt found that the HTTP/2 implementation bypassed
    some security checks, thus allowing an attacker to conduct
    directory traversal attacks by using specially crafted URLs.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.0.14-1+deb8u11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.5.14-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.</p>
