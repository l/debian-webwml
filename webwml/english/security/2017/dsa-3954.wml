<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in sandbox bypass,
incorrect authentication, the execution of arbitrary code, denial of
service, information disclosure, use of insecure cryptography or
bypassing Jar verification.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7u151-2.6.11-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.</p>
