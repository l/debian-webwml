<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server
implementation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3136">CVE-2017-3136</a>

    <p>Oleg Gorokhov of Yandex discovered that BIND does not properly
    handle certain queries when using DNS64 with the "break-dnssec yes;"
    option, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3137">CVE-2017-3137</a>

    <p>It was discovered that BIND makes incorrect assumptions about the
    ordering of records in the answer section of a response containing
    CNAME or DNAME resource records, leading to situations where BIND
    exits with an assertion failure. An attacker can take advantage of
    this condition to cause a denial-of-service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-3138">CVE-2017-3138</a>

    <p>Mike Lalumiere of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND can exit with a
    REQUIRE assertion failure if it receives a null command string on
    its control channel. Note that the fix applied in Debian is only
    applied as a hardening measure. Details about the issue can be found
    at <a href="https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471">https://kb.isc.org/article/AA-01471</a> .</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:9.10.3.dfsg.P4-12.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
