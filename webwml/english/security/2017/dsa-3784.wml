<p>Thomas Gerbet discovered that viewvc, a web interface for CVS and
Subversion repositories, did not properly sanitize user input. This
problem resulted in a potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.22-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.26-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your viewvc packages.</p>
