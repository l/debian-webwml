<p>Jeffrey Altman, Viktor Dukhovni, and Nicolas Williams reported that
Heimdal, an implementation of Kerberos 5 that aims to be compatible with
MIT Kerberos, trusts metadata taken from the unauthenticated plaintext
(Ticket), rather than the authenticated and encrypted KDC response. A
man-in-the-middle attacker can use this flaw to impersonate services to
the client.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://orpheus-lyre.info/">https://orpheus-lyre.info/</a> for details.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.6~rc2+dfsg-9+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.1.0+dfsg-13+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.4.0.dfsg.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.</p>
