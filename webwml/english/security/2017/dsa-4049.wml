<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FFmpeg multimedia
framework, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code if malformed files/streams are processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:3.2.9-1~deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
