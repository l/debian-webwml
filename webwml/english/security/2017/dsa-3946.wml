<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libsmpack, a library used to handle Microsoft
compression formats, did not properly validate its input. A remote
attacker could craft malicious CAB or CHM files and use this flaw to
cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.5-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmspack packages.</p>
