<p>Matviy Kotoniy reported that the gdImageCreateFromGifCtx() function used
to load images from GIF format files in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation, does not zero stack
allocated color map buffers before their use, which may result in
information disclosure if a specially crafted file is processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.0-5+deb8u10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.4-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
