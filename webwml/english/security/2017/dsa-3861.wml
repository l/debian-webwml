<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Jirasek of Secunia Research discovered that libtasn1, a library
used to handle Abstract Syntax Notation One structures, did not
properly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to cause a
crash by denial-of-service, or potentially execute arbitrary code, by
tricking a user into processing a maliciously crafted assignments
file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-3+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.</p>
