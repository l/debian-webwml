<p>It was discovered that the pg_ctlcluster, pg_createcluster and
pg_upgradecluster commands handled symbolic links insecurely which could
result in local denial of service by overwriting arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 165+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 181+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-common packages.</p>
