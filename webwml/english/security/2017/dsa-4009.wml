<p>Niklas Abel discovered that insufficient input sanitising in the the
ss-manager component of shadowsocks-libev, a lightweight socks5 proxy,
could result in arbitrary shell command execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.3+ds-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your shadowsocks-libev packages.</p>
