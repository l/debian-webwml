<p>It was discovered that YADIFA, an authoritative DNS server, did not
sufficiently check its input. This allowed a remote attacker to cause
a denial-of-service by forcing the daemon to enter an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your yadifa packages.</p>
