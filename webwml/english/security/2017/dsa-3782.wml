<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the bypass of
Java sandbox restrictions, denial of service, arbitrary code execution,
incorrect parsing or URLs/LDAP DNs or cryptoraphice timing side channel
attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7u121-2.6.8-2~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.</p>
