<p>Wen Bin discovered that bchunk, an application that converts a CD
image in bin/cue format into a set of iso and cdr/wav tracks files,
did not properly check its input. This would allow malicious users to
crash the application or potentially execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.0-12+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0-12+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bchunk packages.</p>
