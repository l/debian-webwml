<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7487">CVE-2017-7487</a>

    <p>Li Qiang reported a reference counter leak in the ipxitf_ioctl
    function which may result into a use-after-free vulnerability,
    triggerable when a IPX interface is configured.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7645">CVE-2017-7645</a>

    <p>Tuomas Haanpaa and Matti Kamunen from Synopsys Ltd discovered that
    the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations are vulnerable to an
    out-of-bounds memory access issue while processing arbitrarily long
    arguments sent by NFSv2/NFSv3 PRC clients, leading to a denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-7895">CVE-2017-7895</a>

    <p>Ari Kauppi from Synopsys Ltd discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3
    server implementations do not properly handle payload bounds
    checking of WRITE requests. A remote attacker with write access to a
    NFS mount can take advantage of this flaw to read chunks of
    arbitrary memory from both kernel-space and user-space.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8064">CVE-2017-8064</a>

    <p>Arnd Bergmann found that the DVB-USB core misused the device
    logging system, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability, with
    unknown security impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8890">CVE-2017-8890</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the net_csk_clone_lock() function allows a
    remote attacker to cause a double free leading to a denial of
    service or potentially have other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8924">CVE-2017-8924</a>

    <p>Johan Hovold found that the io_ti USB serial driver could leak
    sensitive information if a malicious USB device was connected.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8925">CVE-2017-8925</a>

    <p>Johan Hovold found a reference counter leak in the omninet USB
    serial driver, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.  This
    can be triggered by a local user permitted to open tty devices.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9074">CVE-2017-9074</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the IPv6 fragmentation
    implementation could read beyond the end of a packet buffer.  A
    local user or guest VM might be able to use this to leak sensitive
    information or to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9075">CVE-2017-9075</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the SCTP/IPv6 implementation
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, resulting
    in a use-after-free vulnerability, a similar issue to
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8890">CVE-2017-8890</a>.  This can be triggered by any local user.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9076">CVE-2017-9076</a>

	/ <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9077">CVE-2017-9077</a>

    <p>Cong Wang found that the TCP/IPv6 and DCCP/IPv6 implementations
    wrongly initialised address lists on connected sockets, a similar
    issue to <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9075">CVE-2017-9075</a>.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9242">CVE-2017-9242</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported a packet buffer overrun in the IPv6
    implementation.  A local user could use this for denial of service
    (memory corruption; crash) and possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000364">CVE-2017-1000364</a>

    <p>The Qualys Research Labs discovered that the size of the stack guard
    page is not sufficiently large. The stack-pointer can jump over the
    guard-page and moving from the stack into another memory region
    without accessing the guard-page. In this case no page-fault
    exception is raised and the stack extends into the other memory
    region. An attacker can exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.</p>

    <p>The default stack gap protection is set to 256 pages and can be
    configured via the stack_guard_gap kernel parameter on the kernel
    command line.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.43-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.9.30-2+deb9u1 or earlier versions before the stretch release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
