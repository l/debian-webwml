<p>It was discovered that RT::Authen::ExternalAuth, an external
authentication module for Request Tracker, is vulnerable to timing
side-channel attacks for user passwords. Only ExternalAuth in DBI
(database) mode is vulnerable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.25-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rt-authen-externalauth packages.</p>
