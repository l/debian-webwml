<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libXcursor, a X cursor management library, is
prone to several heap overflows when parsing malicious files. An
attacker can take advantage of these flaws for arbitrary code execution,
if a user is tricked into processing a specially crafted cursor file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.1.14-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.1.14-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxcursor packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libxcursor please refer to its
security tracker page at:
