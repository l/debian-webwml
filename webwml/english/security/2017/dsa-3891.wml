<p>Aniket Nandkishor Kulkarni discovered that in tomcat8, a servlet and
JSP engine, static error pages used the original request's HTTP method
to serve content, instead of systematically using the GET method. This
could under certain conditions result in undesirable results,
including the replacement or removal of the custom error page.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 8.0.14-1+deb8u10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.5.14-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 8.5.14-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.5.14-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.</p>
