<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in impersonation
of Kerberos services, denial of service, sandbox bypass or HTTP header
injection.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7u151-2.6.11-2~deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-7 packages.</p>
