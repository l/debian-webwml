<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative
DNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2120">CVE-2016-2120</a>

    <p>Mathieu Lafon discovered that pdns does not properly validate
    records in zones. An authorized user can take advantage of this flaw
    to crash server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone
    under their control and then sending a DNS query for that record.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7068">CVE-2016-7068</a>

    <p>Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns parses all records
    present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even
    legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an
    abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in a partial
    denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7072">CVE-2016-7072</a>

    <p>Mongo discovered that the webserver in pdns is susceptible to a
    denial-of-service vulnerability. A remote, unauthenticated attacker
    to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of f TCP
    connections to the web server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7073">CVE-2016-7073</a> /
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-7074">CVE-2016-7074</a>

    <p>Mongo discovered that pdns does not sufficiently validate TSIG
    signatures, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to
    alter the content of an AXFR.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.1-4+deb8u7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns packages.</p>
