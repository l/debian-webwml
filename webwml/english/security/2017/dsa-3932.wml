<p>Several problems were discovered in Subversion, a centralised version
control system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8734">CVE-2016-8734</a>

<p>(jessie only)</p>

    <p>Subversion's mod_dontdothat server module and Subversion clients
    using http(s):// were vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack
    caused by exponential XML entity expansion.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-9800">CVE-2017-9800</a>

    <p>Joern Schneeweisz discovered that Subversion did not correctly
    handle maliciously constructed svn+ssh:// URLs. This allowed an
    attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for instance via
    svn:externals properties or when using <q>svnsync sync</q>.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.8.10-6+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.5-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
