<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns-recursor, a recursive
DNS server, parses all records present in a query regardless of whether
they are needed or even legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated
attacker to cause an abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server,
resulting in a partial denial of service if the system becomes
overloaded.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.2-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.</p>
