<p>steelo discovered a remote code execution vulnerability in Samba, a
SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix. A malicious client with
access to a writable share, can take advantage of this flaw by uploading
a shared library and then cause the server to load and execute it.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.2.14+dfsg-0+deb8u6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
