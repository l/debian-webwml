<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache2 HTTP server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-0736">CVE-2016-0736</a>

  <p>RedTeam Pentesting GmbH discovered that mod_session_crypto was
  vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which could allow an attacker
  to guess the session cookie.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-2161">CVE-2016-2161</a>

  <p>Maksim Malyutin discovered that malicious input to mod_auth_digest
  could cause the server to crash, causing a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8743">CVE-2016-8743</a>

  <p>David Dennerline, of IBM Security's X-Force Researchers, and RÃ©gis
  Leroy discovered problems in the way Apache handled a broad pattern
  of unusual whitespace patterns in HTTP requests. In some
  configurations, this could lead to response splitting or cache
  pollution vulnerabilities.  To fix these issues, this update makes
  Apache httpd be more strict in what HTTP requests it accepts.</p>

  <p>If this causes problems with non-conforming clients, some checks can
  be relaxed by adding the new directive <q>HttpProtocolOptions unsafe</q>
  to the configuration.</p></li>
  
</ul>

<p>This update also fixes the issue where mod_reqtimeout was not enabled
by default on new installations.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-10+deb8u8.</p>

<p>For the testing (stretch) and unstable (sid) distributions, these
problems have been fixed in version 2.4.25-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>
