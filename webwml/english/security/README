                  /security/ -- Debian Security Advisories
                  ========================================

This directory contains the status of all Debian related security problems
that have been reported.

Indices are created similarly to the News/ directory.

  Publishing a new advisory
  -------------------------

New advisories are stored by the security team in 
security.debian.org:/org/security.debian.org/advisories/DSA/
The parse_advisory.pl script is used on these files in order to create the
corresponding dsa-XXX.wml and dsa-XXX.data files, from which the advisory
web pages are made.

You can also use the text of the advisory as sent over the
debian-security-announce mailing list if you have no access to security.d.o
and no one of the security team has time to help you.
Therefor you have to save the mail body in a file named 
dsa-<dsanum>-<revnum>.<pkgname>

Usage:
	./parse_advisory.pl [ -d ] <advisory_file>

The option -d enables debug mode, meaning that the output is redirected
to standard output (stdout).

  Updating an advisory
  --------------------

When a new revision of an advisory is released, you would normally
just edit the .wml and .data files to reflect the changes.
However, if some packages have been added to the advisory it can be 
helpful to run parse_advisory.pl in a separate directory and copy the
new URLs to the old advisory. 
You can specify the date of revisions in the report_date tag
as comma-delimited list.

If a new revision is released before the next report and within a 
short time after the preceding one (half a week or so), you 
probably want to replace the last date instead, because new revisions 
appear as separate entries in the list on security/index.

The possibility to specify a comma-separated list in a report_date
tag instead one date is new since 03/2003 and thus not used in
advisories released before that. If you want to update the old
advisories: Just do it! But this has no high priority.

  Translating an advisory
  -----------------------

Don't translate the *.data files, only the *.wml files.

In addition to translating the text of each advisory, you need to
make sure that the translations in the ../po/security.xy.po file
are up to date (the strings in the templates).
