#use wml::debian::template title="Auditing Package Prioritization Guidelines"
#use wml::debian::recent_list

<p>When performing an audit of the Debian distribution one of the
first problems is deciding which packages to examine.</p>

<p>Ideally all packages would be examined, but due to the sheer size
of the archive there has to be a simple way of prioritizing the
work.</p>

<p>As a simple set of guidelines the packages worth examination first
are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Any binary which is installed setuid or setgid.</li>

<li>Anything which provides a service over a network.</li>

<li>Any remotely accessible CGI/PHP scripts.</li>

<li>Anything which contains a cronjob or other automated script which
runs with root privileges.</li>

</ol>

<p>Popular packages should generally receive a higher priority, since any
 problems in them will affect a greater number of users.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://popcon.debian.org/">Debian Popularity
Contest</a> keeps a running survey to show what packages are most
popular among the volunteers in the survey.</p>

<p>In particular, take a look at the <a
href="http://popcon.debian.org/by_vote"> packages sorted by vote</a>.
The "by vote" list ranks packages by how often they're used by the
people participating in the survey.</p>

<p>If a package is important to security, especially if it meets one
of the criteria above, and it's popular (according to a survey like
this one), then it's <i>definitely</i> a candidate for review.</p>


<h2><tt>setuid</tt> and <tt>setgid</tt> binaries</h2>

<p><tt>setuid</tt> and <tt>setgid</tt> binaries are the traditional
targets for security audits, as compromising a vulnerable binary with
either of these permissions can lead to a local user gaining access to
privileges they shouldn't otherwise have.</p>

<p>To aid the search there is a list of all the setuid and setgid
binaries contained in the current stable release in a searchable form
here:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://shellcode.org/Setuid/">Searchable setuid/setgid
list</a></li>

</ul>

<p>When it comes to choosing these binaries it's important to remember
that some such binaries are more security sensitive than others.
setuid(root) binaries should be examined ahead of setgid(games) and
setuid(bugs) for example.</p>


<h2>Network Servers</h2>

<p>Networking servers are another obvious source of inspiration when
it comes to performing a security audit, as an exploitable problem in
them could lead to attackers compromising machines remotely.</p>

<p>Remote compromises are usually much more severe than local
compromises.</p>

<h2>Online Scripts</h2>

<p>Online scripts, especially CGI scripts, are really in the same
class as network servers - although your webserver itself may be
secure the scripts which run upon it are just as important.</p>

<p>A bug in a script that is available across the network is as
serious as a bug in a server listening for connections - both could
allow your machine to be compromised equally.</p>

<h2>Cronjobs and system services</h2>

<p>Whilst there aren't many of these around it's worth looking at the
automatic scripts, cronjobs, etc, which are included inside
packages.</p>

<p>A lot of supporting things run as root by default for cleaning
logfiles, etc.</p>

<p>Successful exploitation of a symlink attack could result in a local
compromise.</p>
