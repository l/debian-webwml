#use wml::debian::template title="Conducting an audit"

<p>This page gives a rough overview of the steps necessary to conduct
 an audit of a package.</p>

<p>The first step is to actually choose a package to examine, you should
 pick one that's more critical to security.</p>

<p>See <a href="$(HOME)/security/audit/packages">the list of packages
that we think are most important to audit</a> for suggestions on how
to make your decision.</p>

<p>One thing that should be made clear is that we are <i>not</i> trying
 to make sure that a package is only audited once.  If many people choose to
 examine the same package this is a good thing, as it demonstrates that 
 many people believe the package is security sensitive.</p>

<p>By allowing an essentially random selection of packages we simplify
coordination and we eliminate the problem of "how can you trust person
X to do a good job?"  (We don't need to as it is assumed that sooner
or later somebody else will choose to examine the same program).</p>

<h2>Starting the audit</h2>

<p>After making your package selection you actually need to start the
audit.</p>

<p>If you're not sure about the kind of problems you're looking for
first start by reading a book on how to develop secure software.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs">Secure
Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</a> has a lot of good information
that can help you. 
<a href="http://www.securecoding.org/">Secure Coding: Principles & Practices</a>
by Mark G. Graff and Kenneth R. van Wyk is also an excellent
book.</p>

<p>Although tools are imperfect, they can still be extremely helpful
in finding likely vulnerabilities, See <a href="tools">the auditing
tools page</a> for more information on some of the available auditing
tools and how they are used.</p> 

<p>As well as looking at the code itself it is a good idea to read the
documentation of the package itself, and try installing it and using
it.</p>

<p>This might allow you to think of ways to subvert the program in
 its typical operation.</p>

<h2>Reporting Problems</h2>

<p>If you do discover a problem within the package that you are examining it
 then you should report it.</p>

<p>As security bugs shouldn't be disclosed generally until after they
have been fixed <i>do not</i> report them via the standard <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/">Debian Bug Tracking System</a>, instead
report the problem directly to <a href="$(HOME)/security/">the
Security Team</a> who will handle the release of an updated
package.</p>

<p>Ideally each report should contain a fix for the problem which you
have discovered, which has been tested and verified to actually close
the problem.</p>

<p>If you do not have a fix then the more detail you can give on the
scope of the problem, the relative severity of the issue and any
workarounds the better.</p>

<p>The security team will coordinate with any other Linux
Distributions if necessary and contact the package maintainer on your
behalf.</p>
