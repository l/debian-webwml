<p>This page lists some of the common questions it is anticipated visitors may have when hearing of this project for the first time.</p>

<toc-display>

<toc-add-entry name="start">When was the Debian Security Audit Project
started?</toc-add-entry>
<p>The first advisory was released in December 2002, followed by a series of additional advisories over time.</p>
<p>It continued in an unofficial capacity until being granted
an "official" status in May 2004 by the Debian Project Leader, Martin Michlmayr.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="advisories">Which advisories have resulted from the
auditing effort?</toc-add-entry>
<p>There have been multiple advisories released as part of the auditing work, all those which were released before the project was given official status are listed in the <a href="advisories">Audit Advisories page</a>.</p>
<p>It is hoped that in the near future, publicly-known advisories from the project after this time can be found by looking at the Debian Security Advisory reports and searching for "Debian Security Audit Project".</p>

<toc-add-entry name="credit">Who has contributed to this work?</toc-add-entry>
<p>Steve Kemp started the Debian Security Audit project, creating it's initial process, and tested it by finding many vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar joined during this early unofficial time and found several
vulnerabilities which have since been fixed, Ulf was followed shortly
afterward by Jaguar who also found several significant security
problems.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com">David A. Wheeler</a> goaded Steve Kemp into volunteering to lead it as an official Debian project, which was made possible by the involvement of Debian Project Leader Martin Michlmayr.  David also made many helpful suggestions about the content of these pages, directly contributing several sections.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.debian.org/security">Debian Security team</a>
have been very helpful in making auditing succeed by making sure that any vulnerabilities found are rapidly fixed and distributed to the world.</p>
<p>More contributors are always welcome!</p>


<toc-add-entry name="contribute">How can I contribute?</toc-add-entry>
<p>If you have the time and skills necessary to audit a package then simply go ahead and do so!</p>
<p>The <a href="auditing">auditing overview</a> should give you a good idea of how to go about the job - any additional questions you might have may be asked upon the <a href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit mailing list</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="maintainer">How can I contribute as a package
maintainer?</toc-add-entry>
<p>Package maintainers can help ensure the security of the software that they package by looking over the code themselves, or asking for help.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="maintainers">auditing for package maintainers</a> overview.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="reporting">How do I report a problem I
discover?</toc-add-entry>
<p>There is a section in the <a href="$(HOME)/security/faq">Security Team
FAQ</a> describing the process.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="clean">Are packages audited and found clean
available?</toc-add-entry>
<p>No, packages which have been examined and had no problems found within them are not listed publically.</p>
<p>This is partly because there may well be problems lurking which were missed and partly because the audits have been conducted by several people without a great deal of coordination.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="moreinfo">Where can I find more
information</toc-add-entry>
<p>There is a mailing list which you may subscribe to and ask questions upon.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit mailing list page</a> for more details.</p>
