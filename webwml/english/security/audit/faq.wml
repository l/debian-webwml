<p>This page lists some of the common questions
visitors may have when hearing of this project for the first time.</p>

<toc-display>

<toc-add-entry name="what">What is the Debian Security Audit
Project?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The Debian Security Audit Project is a small project conducted
within the Debian project, designed to take a proactive stance towards
security by performing source code audits of the packages available to
Debian users.</p>

<p>The audit is focussed upon the Debian stable distribution, with the
auditing work being directed by the <a href="packages">package
prioritization guidelines</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="start">When was the Debian Security Audit Project
started?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The first advisory was released in December 2002, followed by a
series of additional advisories over time.</p>

<p>It continued in an unofficial capacity until being granted an
<q>official</q> status in May 2004 by the Debian Project Leader, Martin
Michlmayr.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="advisories-from-audit">Which advisories have
resulted from the auditing effort?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There have been multiple advisories released as part of the
auditing work, all those which were released before the project was
given official status are listed in the <a href="advisories">Audit
Advisories page</a>.</p>

<p>It is hoped that in the near future, publicly-known advisories from
the project after this time can be found by looking at the Debian
Security Advisory reports and searching for <q>Debian Security Audit
Project</q>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="advisories">Is all audit work related to
advisories?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Actually no. There are many security issues that the audit process
has found that are not immediately exploitable (they might, however,
make a program crash). Some other exploitable security issues we've
found were not present in Debian's official stable release but were
present in the testing or unstable release. All of these are reported
through Debian's bug tracking system (and in some cases directly to
upstream authors). You can take a look at some of the <a
href="bugs">bugs</a> that have been opened because of the audit
process.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="credit">Who has contributed to this work?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Steve Kemp started the Debian Security Audit project, creating it's
initial process, and tested it by finding many vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Ulf Härnhammar joined during this early unofficial time and found
several vulnerabilities which have since been fixed, Ulf was followed
shortly afterward by Jaguar and Javier Fern&aacute;ndez-Sanguino
who also found several significant security problems.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dwheeler.com">David A. Wheeler</a> goaded Steve
Kemp into volunteering to lead it as an official Debian project, which
was made possible by the involvement of Debian Project Leader Martin
Michlmayr.  David also made many helpful suggestions about the content
of these pages, directly contributing several sections.</p>

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/security">Debian Security
team</a> have been very helpful in making auditing succeed by making
sure that any vulnerabilities found are rapidly fixed and distributed
to the world.</p>

<p>More contributors are always welcome!</p>


<toc-add-entry name="contribute">How can I contribute?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you have the time and skills necessary to audit a package then
simply go ahead and do so!</p>

<p>The <a href="auditing">auditing overview</a> should give you a good
idea of how to go about the job &mdash; any additional questions you might
have may be asked upon the <a
href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit
mailing list</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="mailinglist">Can I discuss specific packages upon the mailing list?</toc-add-entry>

<p>It's best if you do not name packages containing problems which you
have discovered before a <a href="$(HOME)/security/">DSA</a> has been
released.  As this allows malicious users to take advantage of any
flaws you describe before they are fixed.</p>

<p>Instead the mailing list can be used to describe a piece of code
and ask for opinions on whether it is exploitable, and how it may be
fixed.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="maintainer">How can I contribute as a package
maintainer?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Package maintainers can help ensure the security of the software
that they package by looking over the code themselves, or asking for
help.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="maintainers">auditing for package
maintainers</a> overview.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="reporting">How do I report a problem I
discover?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There is a section in the <a href="$(HOME)/security/faq#discover">Security
Team FAQ</a> describing the process.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="clean">Are packages audited and found clean
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>No, packages which have been examined and had no problems found
within them are not listed publicly.</p>

<p>This is partly because there may well be problems lurking which
were missed and partly because the audits have been conducted by
several people without a great deal of coordination.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="moreinfo">Where can I find more
information?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There is a mailing list which you may subscribe to and ask
questions upon.</p>

<p>Please see the <a
href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit
mailing list page</a> for more details.</p>
