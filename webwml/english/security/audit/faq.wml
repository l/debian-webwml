<a name="start"><i>When was the audit started?</i></a>
<p>A: The audit process was started with the release of the first advisory in December 2002, and continued in an unofficial capacity until being granted an "official" status in May 2004</p>

<a name="advisories"><i>What advisories have resulted?</i></a>
<p>There have been multiple advisories released as part of the auditing work, these are listed offsite here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://shellcode.org/Advisories/">http://shellcode.org/Advisories</a></li>
</ul>

<a name="contribute"><i>How can I contribute?</i></a>
<p>If you have the time and skills necessary to audit a package then simply go ahead and do so!  The next question explains how the results should be handled.</p>


<a name="reporting"><i>How do I report a problem I discover?</i></a>
<p>There is a section in the <a href="/security/faq">Security Team FAQ</a> describing the process.</p>

<a name="clean"><i>Are packages audited and found clean available?</i></a>
<p>No, packages which have been examined and had no problems found within them are not listed publically.</p>
<p>This is partly because there may well be problems lurking which were missed and partly because the audits have been conducted by several people without a great deal of coordination.</p>

<a name="moreinfo"><i>Where can I find more information</i></a>
<p>There is a mailing list which you may subscribe to and ask questions upon.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit mailing list page</a> for more details.</p>
