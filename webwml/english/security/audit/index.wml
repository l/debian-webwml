<p>The Debian Security Audit Project is a project which is focussed upon auditing Debian packages for security issues.</p>
<p>In the short time it has been running it has been responsible for several <a href="/security/">Debian Security Advisories</a> proving that this auditing process really works to improve Debians security.  It is hoped more advisories will result from future work.</p>
<p>By taking a proactive stance in auditing code we can help to ensure that Debian continues its long history of taking security seriously.</p>


<h2>Audit Scope</h2>
<p>The aim of the project is to audit as many of the packages within the Debian stable release as possible for potential flaws.  Important packages which are contained in the unstable distribution may also be examined for flaws, decreasing the liklihood of insecure packages entering the stable release in the first place.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer size of the current Debian release it is infeasible for a small team to be able to audit all the packages, so there is a system of prioritizing packages which are more security sensitive.</p>
<p>The <a href="packages">package prioritization guidelines</a> attempt to ensure that time is spent auditing the packages which matter.</p>

<h2>Released Advisories</h2>
<p>For each package which has been found vulnerable to a security problem there will be a <a href="/security/">DSA</a> released by the Debian Security Team.</p>
<p>For reference there is a <a href="http://shellcode.org/">list of previous advisories</a> which have resulted directly from the auditing process.</p>
