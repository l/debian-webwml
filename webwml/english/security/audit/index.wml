<p>The Debian Security Audit Project is a project which is focused
upon auditing Debian packages for security issues.</p>

<p>In the short time it has been running it has been responsible for
several <a href="$(HOME)/security/">Debian Security Advisories</a>
proving that this auditing process really works to improve Debian
security. It is hoped more advisories will result from future
work.</p>

<p>By taking a proactive stance in auditing code we can help to ensure
that Debian continues its long history of taking security
seriously.</p>


<h2>Audit Scope</h2>

<p>The aim of the project is to audit as many of the packages within
the Debian stable release as possible for potential flaws.  Important
packages which are contained in the unstable distribution may also be
examined for flaws, decreasing the likelihood of insecure packages
entering the stable release in the first place.</p>

<p>Due to the sheer size of the current Debian release it is
infeasible for a small team to be able to audit all the packages, so
there is a system of prioritizing packages which are more security
sensitive.</p>

<p>The <a href="packages">package prioritization guidelines</a>
attempt to ensure that time is spent auditing the packages which
matter, and the <a href="tools">auditing tools overview</a> shows how
some of the available source code scanners may be used to guide an
audit.</p>

<h2>Previously Released Advisories</h2>

<p>For each package which has been found vulnerable to a security
problem there will be a <a href="$(HOME)/security/">DSA</a> released
by the Debian Security Team.</p>

<p>For reference there is a <a href="advisories">list of previous
advisories</a> which have resulted directly from the auditing
process.</p>
