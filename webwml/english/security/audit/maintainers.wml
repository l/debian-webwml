<p>If you are the maintainer of a package which is contained in the
 Debian archive please consider looking over the code yourself.</p>

<p>The availability of source code auditing tools can ease this 
 process significantly, even if you don't have the time to do a 
 thorough audit yourself you can find areas which are potentially 
 problematic.</p>

<p>If you require assistance consider joining the <a href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit mailing list</a> and asking for a volunteer to look over your package.</p>
