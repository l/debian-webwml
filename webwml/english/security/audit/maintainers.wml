#use wml::debian::template title="Auditing For Package Maintainers"
#use wml::debian::recent_list

<p>If you are the maintainer of a package which is contained in the
Debian archive please consider looking over the code yourself.</p>

<p>The availability of source code auditing tools can ease this
process significantly, even if you don't have the time to do a
thorough audit yourself you can find areas which are potentially
problematic.</p>

<p>If you require assistance, please contact either the
<a href="$(HOME)/security/#contact">Debian Security Team</a> or the (public)
<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/">debian-security
mailing list</a> for assistance on how to conduct a source code audit.</p>

# consider joining the <a
#href="http://shellcode.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-audit">debian-audit
#mailing list</a> and asking for a volunteer to look over your
#package.</p>
 
<h2>New Releases</h2>

<p>As part of being a responsive maintainer you should also be keeping
an eye upon new releases of your package upstream.  If the changelog
mentions a security problem you should attempt to see if you have a
version of the code in the stable distribution which is
vulnerable.</p>

<p>If you do have a vulnerable version available in the stable
distribution then please contact the security team - as described <a
href="$(HOME)/security/faq">in the security team FAQ</a>.</p>
