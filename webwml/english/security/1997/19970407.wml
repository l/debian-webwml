<b>Date: Mon, 7 Apr 1997 22:59:27 -0400 (EDT)</b> <br>
<b>From: Bradley M Keryan &lt;keryan@andrew.cmu.edu&gt;</b> <p>

amd from the amd-920824upl102-6.i386.rpm file distributed with RedHat
Linux 4.1 does not honor the nodev option for NFS filesystems and probably
other mount types, allowing any user access to the device files in /dev on
a system, provided that they have root access to another linux box on the
network. In addition, the default amd.conf from RH 4.1 maps /net/* to NFS
mounting, which makes the bug in amd an easily accessible security hole. <p>

<b>The Exploit:</b> <p>

A friend of mine who has an account on my machine found a major security
hole in amd when he decided to play a prank on me involving /dev/dsp at
odd hours, but found I had denied access to /dev/dsp and /dev/audio. He
assumed that I had forgotten to put the options nosuid and nodev in the
amd mapping for NFS (the default RedHat 4.1 mapping, which *does* have
opts=nosuid,nodev), so he created a char device on his machine with major
number 14 and minor 3, permissions 666, exported the directory it was in
via NFS, and logged into my machine. He used the /net/* amd mapping to
mount the directory, and then used the char device in the NFS-mounted
filesystem to play sounds, although /proc/mounts and /etc/mtab displayed
it as mounted nodev. <p>

This exploit works for block and char devices. It could be used to do more
malicious acts than merely play sounds, such as scan /dev/mem for
passwords, change file permissions or the contents of /etc/shadow with a
raw disk editor, and sundry and various other bad things. <p>

This bug may affect any other distributions that include amd, but both
the exploit and the bug have only been tested on RedHat 4.1. <p>

<b>The Fix:</b>

A one-character typo in the linux-specific header file for amd prevents it
from actually passing the nodev option to the kernel. <p>

That's it. Evidently M_NODEV was defined to something else elsewhere,
otherwise amd shouldn't have compiled. <p>
