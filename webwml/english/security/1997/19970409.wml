<p>The hole may be exploitable if you let metamail run showext for messages
of type message/external-body. At least tcsh, and possibly a few other csh's,
do seem to do weird things when expanding command line arguments. If you
give a script an argument of "foo FTP=/tmp/evilcmd", and it does

<pre>
	set var=$1
</pre>

<p>this will assign foo to $var, and /tmp/evilcmd to $FTP. Unfortunately,
metamail invokes showext with the MIME attributes on the command line,
so you basically send it a header like this

<pre>
   Content-type:  message/external-body;
	   access-type="anon-ftp";
	   name="passwd";
	   site="monad.swb.de";
	   directory="/etc";
	   mode="image FTP=/tmp/evilcmd"
</pre>

<p>Further below, the script will run $FTP to initiate the FTP connection.
Up to now, I have not been able to pass arguments to the command, but
that doesn't mean that you can't do interesting things with the above.
