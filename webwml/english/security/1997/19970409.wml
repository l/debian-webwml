This appears to be a tcsh bug, but it shows up with metamail and can
be abused. Olaf's message follows below. I've also passed it on to CERT <p>

Hi Alan, <p>

Here's the info on metamail I promised to send you. The hole may be
exploitable if you let metamail run showext for messages of type
message/external-body. At least tcsh, and possily a few other csh's,
do seem to do weird things when expanding command line arguments.
If you give a script an argument of "foo FTP=/tmp/evilcmd", and it
does <p>

<pre>
	set var=$1
</pre>

this will assign foo to $var, and /tmp/evilcmd to $FTP. Unfortunately,
metamail invokes showext with the mime attributes on the command line,
so you basically send it a header like this <p>

<pre>
   Content-type:  message/external-body;
	   access-type="anon-ftp";
	   name="passwd";
	   site="monad.swb.de";
	   directory="/etc";
	   mode="image FTP=/tmp/evilcmd"
</pre>

Further below, the script will run $FTP to initiate the ftp connection.
Up to now, I have not been able to pass arguments to the command, but
that doesn't mean that you can't do interesting things with the above. <p>

Patch removed due to age.<p>

Cheers
Olaf <p>
