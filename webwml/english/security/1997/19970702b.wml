<blockquote>
<b>From: John Goerzen &lt;jgoerzen@happy.cs.twsu.edu&gt;</b>, Maintainer of elm <br>
<b>Date: Thu, 15 May 1997 11:44:08 -0500</b><p>

There has recently been announced a security hole in Elm on bugtraq and
subsequently on linux-security that could lead to unauthorized to, at
minimum, the mail spool for every user on the system.<p>

Debian's default Elm for stable (1.2.x) is Elm.  This version of Elm is
vulnerable.<p>

The default mailer for frozen (upcoming 1.3 release) and unstable
(continuing development), Elm-ME+ (an enhanced version of Elm), is also
vulnerable.<p>

I have patched Elm-ME+ to fix this problem.  I have released the packages
into stable, frozen, and unstable.  In addition, the latest Elm-ME+ is
always available via anonymous FTP from <a href="ftp://happy.cs.twsu.edu/pub/Debian/binaries/">ftp://happy.cs.twsu.edu/pub/Debian/binaries/</a>. <p>

The fixed version of Elm-ME+, elm-me+_2.4pl25ME+31-5_i386.deb, is available
for immediate download at <a href="ftp://happy.cs.twsu.edu/pub/Debian/binaries/elm-me+_2.4pl25ME+31-5_i386.deb">ftp://happy.cs.twsu.edu/pub/Debian/binaries/elm-me+_2.4pl25ME+31-5_i386.deb</a>. <p>

I would advise people to upgrade to the latest Elm-ME+.  Those people
running Elm and not Elm-ME+ -- Elm-ME+ fixes a number of other bugs as well,
so it wouldn't hurt to upgrade. <p>
