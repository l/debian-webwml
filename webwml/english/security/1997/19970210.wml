<p>Vulnerability in minicom allows (certain) local users to obtain group
"uucp" privileges and, in certain cases, root privileges.

<p>Minicom binary is usually owned by user "root" and group "uucp", and it
is "-rwxr-sr-x" or, in some old distributions, "-rwsr-sr-x". Actually,
minicom has <em>alot</em> of arbitrary size buffers and it is really easy to
overrun some of them. At least one of these overrunable buffers is
automatic -- an argument to "-d" option of minicom is copied into 128 bytes
long automatic array. Thus, it is possible to overwrite the function return
address and to execute an arbitrary code (as usually).

<p>If minicom is installed suid root, any user which is permitted to use
minicom can obtain root shell. If minicom is installed sgid uucp, any
minicom user can obtain uucp group privileges (please don't think it's
nothing -- at least on Slackware machines /usr/lib/uucp is group-writeable.
This means you can easily substitute uucico/uuxqt/etc with your scripts).
