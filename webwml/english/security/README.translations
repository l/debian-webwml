This directory contains the status of all Debian related security problems
that have been reported. Indices are created similarly to the News/ directory.
Translations are up to you.

Don't translate the *.data files, only the *.wml files.

In addition to translating the security items, you need to
make sure that the translation in english/template/debian/security.wml
is up to date.
