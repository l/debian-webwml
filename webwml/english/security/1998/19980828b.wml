We have received reports of a new kind of denial of service attack that was
disabling INN news systems.  Someone sent out tons of sendsys messages
with forged "From" addresses.  This can cause high load on a news system
if it would process the requests.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is <strong>not</strong> vulnerable to this when the
default setup is kept since such requests are only logged. However, they'll
be processed if they come from two well known addresses.

<p>This type of control messages is not needed anymore since the USENET has
grown so much and is very reliable.  Thus it doesn't hurt to turn this
report mechanism off.
