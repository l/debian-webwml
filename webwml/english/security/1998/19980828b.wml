<define-tag moreinfo>
We have received reports of a new kind of denial of service lately that was
about killing an INN news system.  Someone sent out tons of sendsys messages
with forged "From" addresses.  This can cause high load on a news system if
when the system processes the requests.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is not vulnerable to this when the default setup is kept
since such requests are only logged.  However they'll be processed if they
come from two well known addresses.

<p>This type of control messages is not needed anymore since the usenet has
grown so much and is very reliable.  Thus it doesn't hurt to turn this
report mechanism off.
