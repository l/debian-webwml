<define-tag moreinfo>
There has been a lot of confusion over ssh lately: some people think
their systems have been hacked through ssh, although nobody has been
able to produce an exploit. To avoid any possible problems we have
patched ssh to fix any possible buffer overruns. We think this will
stop any attack that might be out there. This also includes the fixes
to the kerberos code that were distributed.

<p>Please note that this patch does not suffer from the license problems
that other patches that have circulated have, since it does not use
the vsnprintf implementation from ssh 2 but instead uses the code from
sendmail (which was based on code floating around on usenet) for systems
that don't have vsnprintf in their libc.

<p>We recommend you upgrade your ssh package immediately.
