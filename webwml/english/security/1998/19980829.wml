<p>We have received a report from SGI that a vulnerability has been
discovered in the seyon program.  This can lead to a root
compromise.  Any user who can execute the seyon program can
exploit this vulnerability.

<p>Since SGI does not provide exploit information, we are unable to
fix the problem.  SGI provided such information only to recognized
security response/incident/coordination organizations and bugtraq
doesn't seem to be accepted.  SGI doesn't develop patches to third
party products, thus there is no chance for a quick fix.

<p>Since a root compromise needs an executable that runs as root we
tend to believe that this needs a setuid seyon.  The Seyon package
as provided with Debian GNU/Linux does <em>not</em> run setuid root.

<p>Thus we doubt that the seyon package as provided with Debian
GNU/Linux can be used to exploit root if you don't change the
default behaviour.
