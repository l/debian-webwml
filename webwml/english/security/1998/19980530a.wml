<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>We have received a report that the one can use a simple buffer
overflow exploit to gain access to the group shadow on systems running
klock.  There was also a problem in kvt which saved its configuration
as root and not as regular user.

<p>We recommend you upgrade your kdebase package immediately.
