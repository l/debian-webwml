<p>We have found that the fte package as supplied in our slink (frozen)
and potato (unstable) archives does not drop its root privileges
after initializing the virtual console device. This allows all users
to read and write files with root privileges, and execute all programs
as root.</p>

<p>A new package (version 0.46b-4.1) has been uploaded to fix this problem.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fte package immediately.
