We have found that the fsp package introduces a possible security flaw.
When the fsp package is installed it adds the user "ftp" without prompting
the admin. This can enable anonymous FTP if you use the standard FTP daemon
or wu-ftpd.

<p>If you have installed fsp and an FTP daemon, and do not want to have
anonymous FTP enabled, you should remove the "ftp" account. This can be done
with the command "<kbd>userdel ftp</kbd>".

<p>Please note that if you use proftpd as the FTP daemon this flaw will not
affect you, since it required one to enable anonymous FTP manually.

<p>We have fixed this in fsp 2.71-10. Please note that if you have already
installed fsp, upgrading to this version will <strong>not</strong> remove
the user "ftp", you will have to do manually.
