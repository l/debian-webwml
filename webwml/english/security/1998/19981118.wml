<define-tag moreinfo>
There have been reports that some Linux distributions are affected by
a vulnerability in samba. There are two issues:
<ul>
 <li>the wsmbconf program (which is still a prototype application not
     meant for general release) is unsafe. Debian does not distribute this
     program.
 <li>some distributions used a world-writable directory without a t bit.
     We use /var/tmp which does not suffer from this problem.
</ul>

<p>There is no need to upgrade your samba package.
