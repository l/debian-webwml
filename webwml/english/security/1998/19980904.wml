The program rpc.mountd is a mount daemon that handles NFS mounts.
The version as shipped with current distributions of Linux contains
a buffer overflow.

<p>The overflow can be used as part of an attack to gain root access on
the machine acting as a NFS server.

<p>We recommend you upgrade your netstd package immediately.
