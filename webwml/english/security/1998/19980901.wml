Recent messages on a computer security forum have again reported that there
are buffer overflows in minicom.  These can lead into root exploits if the
program is installed setuid root.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 is <em>not</em> vulnerable to this exploit.

<p>The program minicom as shipped with the distribution is not installed
setuid root.  This is not needed on a Debian GNU/Linux system.
