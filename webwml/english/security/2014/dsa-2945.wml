<p>Thomas Stangner discovered a vulnerability in chkrootkit, a rootkit
detector, which may allow local attackers to gain root access when /tmp
is mounted without the noexec option.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.49-4.1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.49-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chkrootkit packages.</p>
