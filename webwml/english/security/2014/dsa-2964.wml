<p>Oscar Reparaz discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in
iodine, a tool for tunneling IPv4 data through a DNS server. A remote
attacker could provoke a server to accept the rest of the setup or
also network traffic by exploiting this flaw.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-12+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-19.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0~rc1-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iodine packages.</p>
