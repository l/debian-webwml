<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the web interface in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, incorrectly validated permissions on rss files and
directory index files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue
to bypass file permissions and read arbitrary files, possibly leading
to a privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.3-5+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
