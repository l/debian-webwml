<p>Jonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the
way wrapped strings are parsed in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input
into an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in libyaml version 0.1.3-1+deb6u5</p>
