<p>Multiple security issues were found in the Tomcat servlet and JSP engine:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2067">CVE-2013-2067</a>

    <p>FORM authentication associates the most recent request requiring 
    authentication with the current session. By repeatedly sending a request 
    for an authenticated resource while the victim is completing the login 
    form, an attacker could inject a request that would be executed using the 
    victim's credentials.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2071">CVE-2013-2071</a>

    <p>A runtime exception in AsyncListener.onComplete() prevents the request from 
    being recycled. This may expose elements of a previous request to a current 
    request.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4286">CVE-2013-4286</a>

    <p>Reject requests with multiple content-length headers or with a content-length 
    header when chunked encoding is being used.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4322">CVE-2013-4322</a>

    <p>When processing a request submitted using the chunked transfer encoding, 
    Tomcat ignored but did not limit any extensions that were included. This allows 
    a client to perform a limited denial of service by streaming an unlimited amount 
    of data to the server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0050">CVE-2014-0050</a>

    <p>Multipart requests with a malformed Content-Type header could trigger an 
    infinite loop causing a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.28-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.52-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat7 packages.</p>
