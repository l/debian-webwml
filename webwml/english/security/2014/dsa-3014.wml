<p>Matthew Daley discovered that Squid3, a fully featured web proxy cache,
did not properly perform input validation in request parsing. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to mount a denial of service by sending
crafted Range requests.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
