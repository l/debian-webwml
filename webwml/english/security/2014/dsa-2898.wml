execution of arbitrary code.</p>

in version 8:6.6.0.4-3+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.7.7.10+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8:6.7.7.10+dfsg-1.</p>
