<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jose Duart of the Google Security Team discovered heap-based buffer
overflow flaws in JasPer, a library for manipulating JPEG-2000 files,
which could lead to denial of service (application crash) or the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.900.1-13+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.</p>
