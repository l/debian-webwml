<p>Several issues have been discovered in Tor, a connection-based
low-latency anonymous communication system, resulting in information
leaks.</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>Relay-early cells could be used by colluding relays on the network to
   tag user circuits and so deploy traffic confirmation attacks
   [<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5117">CVE-2014-5117</a>].  The updated version emits a warning and drops the
   circuit upon receiving inbound relay-early cells, preventing this
   specific kind of attack.  Please consult the following advisory for
   more details about this issue:</p>

   <p><a href="https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack">\
   https://blog.torproject.org/blog/tor-security-advisory-relay-early-traffic-confirmation-attack</a></p>
   </li>

   <li><p>A bug in the bounds-checking in the 32-bit curve25519-donna
   implementation could cause incorrect results on 32-bit
   implementations when certain malformed inputs were used along with a
   small class of private ntor keys.  This flaw does not currently
   appear to allow an attacker to learn private keys or impersonate a
   Tor server, but it could provide a means to distinguish 32-bit Tor
   implementations from 64-bit Tor implementations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The following additional security-related improvements have been
implemented:</p>

<ul>
   <li><p>As a client, the new version will effectively stop using CREATE_FAST
   cells.  While this adds computational load on the network, this
   approach can improve security on connections where Tor's circuit
   handshake is stronger than the available TLS connection security
   levels.</p></li>

   <li><p>Prepare clients to use fewer entry guards by honoring the consensus
   parameters.  The following article provides some background:</p>

   </li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.4.23-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.2.4.23-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.5.6-alpha-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
