<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in uscan, a tool to scan
upstream sits for new releases of packages, which is part of the
devscripts package. An attacker controlling a website from which uscan
would attempt to download a source tarball could execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running uscan.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project id <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6888">CVE-2013-6888</a> has
been assigned to identify them.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.6+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 2.13.9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts packages.</p>
