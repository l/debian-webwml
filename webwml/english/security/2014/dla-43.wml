 <p>Stephane Chazelas discovered that the GNU C library, glibc, processed
 ".." path segments in locale-related environment variables, possibly
 allowing attackers to circumvent intended restrictions, such as
 ForceCommand in OpenSSH, assuming that they can supply crafted locale
 settings.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5119">CVE-2014-5119</a>

 <p>Tavis Ormandy discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
 transliteration module loading code in eglibc, Debian's version of the
 GNU C Library.  As a result, an attacker who can supply a crafted
 destination character set argument to iconv-related character
 conversation functions could achieve arbitrary code execution.</p>

 <p>This update removes support of loadable gconv transliteration modules.
 Besides the security vulnerability, the module loading code had
 functionality defects which prevented it from working for the intended
 purpose.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in eglibc version 2.11.3-4+deb6u1</p>
