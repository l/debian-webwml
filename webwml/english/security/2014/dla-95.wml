<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two bugs were discovered in clamav and are fixed by this release.</p>

<p>One issue is in clamscan, the command line anti-virus scanner included
in the package, which could lead to crashes when scanning certain files
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6497">CVE-2013-6497</a>).
The second issue is in libclamav which caused a heap buffer overflow
when scanning a specially crafted y0da Crypter obfuscated PE file
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9050">CVE-2014-9050</a>). Note that this is remotely exploitable when ClamAV is
used as a mail gateway scanner.</p>

<p>If you use clamav, we highly recommend that you upgrade to this version.</p>
