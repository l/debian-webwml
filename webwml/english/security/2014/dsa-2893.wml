<p>Two vulnerabilities were fixed in Openswan, an IKE/IPsec implementation
for Linux.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2053">CVE-2013-2053</a>

    <p>During an audit of Libreswan (with which Openswan shares some code),
    Florian Weimer found a remote buffer overflow in the atodn()
    function.  This vulnerability can be triggered when Opportunistic
    Encryption (OE) is enabled and an attacker controls the PTR record
    of a peer IP address.
    Authentication is not needed to trigger the vulnerability.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6466">CVE-2013-6466</a>

    <p>Iustina Melinte found a vulnerability in Libreswan which also
    applies to the Openswan code. By carefuly crafting IKEv2 packets, an
    attacker can make the pluto daemon dereference non-received IKEv2
    payload, leading to the daemon crash.
    Authentication is not needed to trigger the vulnerability.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Patches were originally written to fix the vulnerabilities in Libreswan,
and have been ported to Openswan by Paul Wouters from the Libreswan
Project.</p>

<p>Since the Openswan package is not maintained anymore in the Debian
distribution and is not available in testing and unstable suites, it is
recommended for IKE/IPsec users to switch to a supported implementation
like strongSwan.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.28+dfsg-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.37-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openswan packages.</p>
