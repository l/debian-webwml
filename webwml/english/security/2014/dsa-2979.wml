<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Fail2ban, a solution to ban hosts 
that cause multiple authentication errors. When using Fail2ban to monitor
Postfix or Cyrus IMAP logs, improper input validation in log parsing 
could enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on arbitrary 
addresses, resulting in denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6-3wheezy3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.11-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban packages.</p>
