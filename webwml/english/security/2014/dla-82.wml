<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>HD Moore of Rapid7 discovered a symlink attack in Wget, a command-line
utility to retrieve files via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. The vulnerability
allows to create arbitrary files on the user's system when Wget runs in
recursive mode against a malicious FTP server. Arbitrary file creation
may override content of user's files or permit remote code execution with
the user privilege.</p>

<p>This update changes the default setting in Wget such that it no longer
creates local symbolic links, but rather traverses them and retrieves the
pointed-to file in such a retrieval.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in wget version 1.12-2.1+deb6u1</p>
