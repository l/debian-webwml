<p>Evgeny Kotkov discovered a NULL pointer dereference while processing
REPORT requests in mod_dav_svn, the Subversion component which is used
to serve repositories with the Apache web server.  A remote attacker
could abuse this vulnerability for a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10-5.</p>
