<p>Guillem Jover discovered that the changelog retrieval functionality in
apt-get used temporary files in an insecure way, allowing a local user
to cause arbitrary files to be overwritten.</p>

<p>This vulnerability is neutralized by the fs.protected_symlinks setting in
the Linux kernel, which is enabled by default in Debian 7 Wheezy and up.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.9.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.</p>
