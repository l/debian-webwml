<p>Bastian Blank reported a denial of service vulnerability in
Email::Address, a Perl module for RFC 2822 address parsing and creation.
Email::Address::parse used significant time on parsing empty quoted
strings. A remote attacker able to supply specifically crafted input to
an application using Email::Address for parsing, could use this flaw to
mount a denial of service attack against the application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.895-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.905-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.905-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libemail-address-perl packages.</p>
