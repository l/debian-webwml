<p>Marvin S. Addison discovered that Jasig phpCAS, a PHP library for the
CAS authentication protocol, did not encode tickets before adding them
to an URL, creating a possibility for cross site scripting.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php-cas packages.</p>
