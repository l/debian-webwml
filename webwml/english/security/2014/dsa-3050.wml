<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors, buffer
overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, the bypass of the
same-origin policy or a loss of privacy.</p>

<p>This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR31 series of Firefox. The new
release introduces a new user interface.</p>

<p>In addition, this update also disables SSLv3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0esr-2~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0esr-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 33.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
