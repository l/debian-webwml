<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, breakouts of the Java sandbox, information disclosure
or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b32-1.13.4-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
