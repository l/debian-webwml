<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is prone to a denial of 
service vulnerability.</p>
<p>By making use of maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server, an 
attacker can exploit an oversight in the code BIND 9 uses to follow 
delegations in the Domain Name Service, causing BIND to issue unlimited 
queries in an attempt to follow the delegation.</p>
<p>This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service 
(up to and including termination of the named server process.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
