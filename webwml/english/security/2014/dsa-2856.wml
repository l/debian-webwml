<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Apache Commons FileUpload package for Java
could enter an infinite loop while processing a multipart request with
a crafted Content-Type, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb6u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-fileupload-java packages.</p>
