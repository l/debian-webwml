<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw was discovered in mediawiki, a wiki engine: cross-domain-policy
mangling allows an article editor to inject code into API consumers
that deserialize PHP representations of the page from the API.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.19.20+dfsg-0+deb7u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.</p>
