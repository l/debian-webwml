<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Maury from ANSSI discovered a flaw in pdns-recursor, a
recursive DNS server : a remote attacker controlling
maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server could affect the
performance of pdns-recursor, thus leading to resource exhaustion and
a potential denial-of-service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdns-recursor packages.</p>
