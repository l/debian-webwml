<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Tor version previously in Debian squeeze, 0.2.2.39, is no longer
supported by upstream.</p>

<p>This update brings the currently stable version of Tor, 0.2.4.23, to
Debian squeeze.</p>

<p>Changes include use of stronger cryptographic primitives, always
clearing bignums before freeing them to avoid leaving key material in
memory, mitigating several linkability vectors such as by disabling
client-side DNS caches, blacklisting authority signing keys potentially
compromised due to heartbleed, updating the list of directory
authorities, and much more.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in tor version 0.2.4.23-1~deb6u1</p>
