<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3610">CVE-2014-3610</a>

    <p>Lars Bull of Google and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM
    handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged
    guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service
    (kernel panic) on the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3611">CVE-2014-3611</a>

    <p>Lars Bull of Google reported a race condition in in the PIT
    emulation code in KVM. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o
    ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash)
    on the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3645">CVE-2014-3645</a>

/ <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3646">CVE-2014-3646</a>

    <p>The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security discovered
    that the KVM subsystem did not handle the VM exits gracefully
    for the invept (Invalidate Translations Derived from EPT) and
    invvpid (Invalidate Translations Based on VPID) instructions. On
    hosts with an Intel processor and invept/invppid VM exit
    support, an unprivileged guest user could use these instructions
    to crash the guest.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3647">CVE-2014-3647</a>

    <p>Nadav Amit reported that KVM mishandles noncanonical addresses when
    emulating instructions that change rip, potentially causing a failed
    VM-entry. A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3673">CVE-2014-3673</a>

    <p>Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered a flaw in net/core/skbuff.c leading to
    a kernel panic when receiving malformed ASCONF chunks. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3687">CVE-2014-3687</a>

    <p>A flaw in the sctp stack was discovered leading to a kernel panic
    when receiving duplicate ASCONF chunks. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3688">CVE-2014-3688</a>

    <p>It was found that the sctp stack is prone to a remotely triggerable
    memory pressure issue caused by excessive queueing. A remote
    attacker could use this flaw to cause denial-of-service conditions
    on the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3690">CVE-2014-3690</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that incorrect register handling in KVM
    may lead to denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7207">CVE-2014-7207</a>

    <p>Several Debian developers reported an issue in the IPv6 networking
    subsystem. A local user with access to tun or macvtap devices, or a
    virtual machine connected to such a device, can cause a denial of
    service (system crash).</p>

<p>This update includes a bug fix related to <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7207">CVE-2014-7207</a> that disables
UFO (UDP Fragmentation Offload) in the macvtap, tun, and virtio_net
drivers. This will cause migration of a running VM from a host running
an earlier kernel version to a host running this kernel version to fail,
if the VM has been assigned a virtio network device. In order to migrate
such a VM, it must be shut down first.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
