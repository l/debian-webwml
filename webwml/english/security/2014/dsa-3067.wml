<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3689">CVE-2014-3689</a>

    <p>The Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security reported that
    guest provided parameter were insufficiently validated in
    rectangle functions in the vmware-vga driver. A privileged guest
    user could use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the
    host, potentially escalating their privileges to those of the
    qemu host process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7815">CVE-2014-7815</a>

    <p>James Spadaro of Cisco reported insufficiently sanitized
    bits_per_pixel from the client in the QEMU VNC display driver. An
    attacker having access to the guest's VNC console could use this
    flaw to crash the guest.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
