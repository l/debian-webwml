<p>Dmitry Kovalenko discovered that the Firebird database server is prone
to a denial of service vulnerability. An unauthenticated remote attacker
could send a malformed network packet to a firebird server, which would
cause the server to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2.26540.ds4-1~deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3.26778.ds4-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.5 packages.</p>
