<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the ntp package, an
implementation of the Network Time Protocol.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9293">CVE-2014-9293</a>

    <p>ntpd generated a weak key for its internal use, with full
    administrative privileges.  Attackers could use this key to
    reconfigure ntpd (or to exploit other vulnerabilities).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9294">CVE-2014-9294</a>

    <p>The ntp-keygen utility generated weak MD5 keys with insufficient
    entropy.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9295">CVE-2014-9295</a>

    <p>ntpd had several buffer overflows (both on the stack and in the
    data section), allowing remote authenticated attackers to crash
    ntpd or potentially execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9296">CVE-2014-9296</a>

    <p>The general packet processing function in ntpd did not handle an
    error case correctly.</p>

<p>The default ntpd configuration in Debian restricts access to localhost
(and possible the adjacent network in case of IPv6).</p>

<p>Keys explicitly generated by "ntp-keygen -M" should be regenerated.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.</p>
