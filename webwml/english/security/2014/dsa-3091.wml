<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in getmail4, a mail 
retriever with support for POP3, IMAP4 and SDPS, that could allow 
man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7273">CVE-2014-7273</a>

    <p>The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.43.0
    does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7274">CVE-2014-7274</a>

    <p>The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify
    that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's
    Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate from a recognized
    Certification Authority.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7275">CVE-2014-7275</a>

    <p>The POP3-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.44.0
    does not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof POP3 servers and obtain
    sensitive information via a crafted certificate.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 4.46.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.46.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your getmail4 packages.</p>
