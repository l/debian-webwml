<p>Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file
utility, whose code is embedded in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language.  When checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly
checked, thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of
service (out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a
specially crafted ELF file.</p>

<p>As announced in DSA-3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerability is addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.35, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:</p>

<url "http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.35" />

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.35-0+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
