<p>Several security issues were found in the Apache HTTP server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0118">CVE-2014-0118</a>

    <p>The DEFLATE input filter (inflates request bodies) in mod_deflate
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource
    consumption) via crafted request data that decompresses to a much
    larger size.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0226">CVE-2014-0226</a>

    <p>A race condition was found in mod_status. An attacker able to
    access a public server status page on a server could send carefully
    crafted requests which could lead to a heap buffer overflow,
    causing denial of service, disclosure of sensitive information, or
    potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0231">CVE-2014-0231</a>

    <p>A flaw was found in mod_cgid. If a server using mod_cgid hosted
    CGI scripts which did not consume standard input, a remote attacker
    could cause child processes to hang indefinitely, leading to denial
    of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.22-13+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed in
version 2.4.10-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>
