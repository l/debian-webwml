<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Libvirt, a virtualisation
abstraction library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0179">CVE-2014-0179</a>

    <p>Richard Jones and Daniel P. Berrange found that libvirt passes the
    XML_PARSE_NOENT flag when parsing XML documents using the libxml2
    library, in which case all XML entities in the parsed documents are
    expanded. A user able to force libvirtd to parse an XML document
    with an entity pointing to a special file that blocks on read access
    could use this flaw to cause libvirtd to hang indefinitely,
    resulting in a denial of service on the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3633">CVE-2014-3633</a>

    <p>Luyao Huang of Red Hat found that the qemu implementation of
    virDomainGetBlockIoTune computed an index into the array of disks
    for the live definition, then used it as the index into the array of
    disks for the persistent definition, which could result into an
    out-of-bounds read access in qemuDomainGetBlockIoTune().</p>

    <p>A remote attacker able to establish a read-only connection to
    libvirtd could use this flaw to crash libvirtd or, potentially, leak
    memory from the libvirtd process.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.12.3-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.</p>
