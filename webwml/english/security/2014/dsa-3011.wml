<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that MediaWiki, a website engine for collaborative
work, is vulnerable to JSONP injection in Flash (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5241">CVE-2014-5241</a>) and
clickjacking between OutputPage and ParserOutput (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5243">CVE-2014-5243</a>). The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MediaWiki to the new upstream
version 1.19.18, which includes additional changes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.19.18+dfsg-0+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.</p>
