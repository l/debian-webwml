<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stephane Chazelas discovered that the GNU C library, glibc, processed
".." path segments in locale-related environment variables, possibly
allowing attackers to circumvent intended restrictions, such as
ForceCommand in OpenSSH, assuming that they can supply crafted locale
settings.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u3.</p>

<p>This update also includes changes previously scheduled for the next
wheezy point release as version 2.13-38+deb7u2.  See the Debian
changelog for details.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>
