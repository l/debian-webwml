<p>James Forshaw discovered that, in Apache Santuario XML Security for
Java, CanonicalizationMethod parameters were incorrectly validated:
by specifying an arbitrary weak canonicalization algorithm, an
attacker could spoof XML signatures.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.5-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml-security-java packages.</p>
