<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit, that may result in denial of service
(application crash, large memory consumption), information leak,
protocol downgrade. Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only
applications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3512">CVE-2014-3512</a>).</p>

<p>Detailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:
<a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt">\
www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt</a></p>

<p>It's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just
the openssl package.</p>

<p>All applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use
the <q>checkrestart</q> tool from the debian-goodies package to detect
affected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u12.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1i-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
