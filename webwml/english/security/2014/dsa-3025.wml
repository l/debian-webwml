<p>It was discovered that APT, the high level package manager, does not
properly invalidate unauthenticated data (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0488">CVE-2014-0488</a>), performs
incorrect verification of 304 replies (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0487">CVE-2014-0487</a>), does not perform
the checksum check when the Acquire::GzipIndexes option is used
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0489">CVE-2014-0489</a>) and does not properly perform validation for binary
packages downloaded by the apt-get download command (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0490">CVE-2014-0490</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.</p>
