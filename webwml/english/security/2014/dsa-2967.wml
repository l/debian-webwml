<p>Jean-Ren√© Reinhard, Olivier Levillain and Florian Maury reported that
GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard, did not properly parse certain garbled
compressed data packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to mount
a denial of service against GnuPG by triggering an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.16-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
