<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>In the past, rpc.statd posted SM_NOTIFY requests using the same socket it used
for sending downcalls to the kernel. To receive replies from remote hosts, the
socket was bound to INADDR_ANY. To prevent unwanted data injection, bind this
socket to the loopback address.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in nfs-utils version 1:1.2.2-4squeeze3</p>
