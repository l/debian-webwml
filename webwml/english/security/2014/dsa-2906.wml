<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service, information leak or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.32-48squeeze5.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
    <tr>
      <th>&nbsp;</th>
      <th>Debian 6.0 (squeeze)</th>

      <td>user-mode-linux</td>
      <td>2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze5</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.
<p><b>Note</b>: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or <q>leap-frog</q> fashion.</p>
