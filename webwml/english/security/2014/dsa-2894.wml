<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSH, an implementation of the
SSH protocol suite. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2532">CVE-2014-2532</a>

    <p>Jann Horn discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled wildcards in
    AcceptEnv lines. A remote attacker could use this issue to trick
    OpenSSH into accepting any environment variable that contains the
    characters before the wildcard character.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2653">CVE-2014-2653</a>

    <p>Matthew Vernon reported that if a SSH server offers a
    HostCertificate that the ssh client doesn't accept, then the client
    doesn't check the DNS for SSHFP records. As a consequence a
    malicious server can disable SSHFP-checking by presenting a
    certificate.</p>

    <p>Note that a host verification prompt is still displayed before
    connecting.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.0p1-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:6.6p1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssh packages.</p>
