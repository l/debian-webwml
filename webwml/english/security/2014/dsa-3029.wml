<p>Antoine Delignat-Lavaud and Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that it was
possible to reuse cached SSL sessions in unrelated contexts, allowing
virtual host confusion attacks in some configurations by an attacker in
a privileged network position.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
