<p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Kauth used Policykit insecurely by 
relying on the process ID. This could result in privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.8.4-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.13.3-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.13.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kde4libs packages.</p>
