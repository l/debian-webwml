<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Antoine Delignat-Lavaud from Inria discovered an issue in the way NSS
(the Mozilla Network Security Service library) was parsing ASN.1 data
used in signatures, making it vulnerable to a signature forgery attack.</p>

<p>An attacker could craft ASN.1 data to forge RSA certificates with a
valid certification chain to a trusted CA.</p>

<p>This update fixes this issue for the NSS libraries.</p>

<p>Note that iceweasel, which is also affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1568">CVE-2014-1568</a>, however
has reached end-of-life in Squeeze(-LTS) and thus has not been fixed.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in nss version 3.12.8-1+squeeze9</p>
