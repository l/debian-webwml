<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were reported in Graphviz, a rich
collection of graph drawing tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0978">CVE-2014-0978</a>

    <p>It was discovered that user-supplied input used in the yyerror()
    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l is not bound-checked before beeing
    copied into an insufficiently sized memory buffer. A
    context-dependent attacker could supply a specially crafted input
    file containing a long line to cause a stack-based buffer overlow,
    resulting in a denial of service (application crash) or potentially
    allowing the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1236">CVE-2014-1236</a>

    <p>Sebastian Krahmer reported an overflow condition in the chkNum()
    function in lib/cgraph/scan.l that is triggered as the used regular
    expression accepts an arbitrary long digit list. With a specially
    crafted input file, a context-dependent attacker can cause a
    stack-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    (application crash) or potentially allowing the execution of
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.26.3-14+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.</p>
