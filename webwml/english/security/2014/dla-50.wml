<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3538">CVE-2014-3538</a>

    <p>file does not properly restrict the amount of data read during
    a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (CPU consumption).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587">CVE-2014-3587</a>

    <p>Integer overflow in the cdf_read_property_info function in
    cdf.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>: The other seven issues for wheezy, fixed in 5.11-2+deb7u4
(<a href="./dsa-3021">DSA-3021-1</a>), were already handled in 5.04-5+squeeze6 (<a href="./dla-27">DLA 27-1</a>) in
July 2014. Also, as an amendment, as a side effect of the changes
done back then, the MIME type detection of some files had
improved from "application/octet-stream" to something more specific
like "application/x-dosexec" or "application/x-iso9660-image".</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in file version 5.04-5+squeeze7</p>
