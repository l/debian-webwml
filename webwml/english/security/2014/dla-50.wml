<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3538">CVE-2014-3538</a>

    <p>file does not properly restrict the amount of data read during
    a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (CPU consumption).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587">CVE-2014-3587</a>

    <p>Integer overflow in the cdf_read_property_info function in
    cdf.c allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (application crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>: The other seven issues for wheezy, fixed in 5.11-2+deb7u4
(DSA-3021-1), were already handled in 5.04-5+squeeze6 (DLA 27-1) in
July 2014. Also, as an amendment, as a side effect of the changes
done back then then, the MIME type detection of some files had
improved from "application/octet-stream" to something more specific
like "application/x-dosexec" or "application/x-iso9660-image".</p>
