<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Murray McAllister discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the gif2tiff
command line tool.  Executing gif2tiff on a malicious tiff image could
result in arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-6+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.3-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
