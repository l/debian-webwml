<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jean-Rene Reinhard, Olivier Levillain and Florian Maury reported that
GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard, did not properly parse certain garbled
compressed data packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to mount
a denial of service against GnuPG by triggering an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in gnupg2 version 2.0.14-2+squeeze3</p>
