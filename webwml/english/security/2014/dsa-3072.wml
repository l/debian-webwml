<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file
utility: when checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly checked,
thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a specially
crafted ELF file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.20-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.</p>
