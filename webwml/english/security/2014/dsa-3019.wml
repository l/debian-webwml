<p>Boris <q>pi</q> Piwinger and Tavis Ormandy reported a heap overflow
vulnerability in procmail's formail utility when processing
specially-crafted email headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to cause formail to crash, resulting in a denial of service or data
loss, or possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22-20+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.22-22.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your procmail packages.</p>
