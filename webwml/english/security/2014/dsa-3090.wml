<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser:  Multiple memory safety errors, buffer
overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to
the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security restrictions or
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixe soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
