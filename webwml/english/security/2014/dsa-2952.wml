<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or possibly disclosure of kernel memory. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1453">CVE-2014-1453</a>

    <p>A remote, authenticated attacker could cause the NFS server become
    deadlocked, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3000">CVE-2014-3000</a>:

    <p>An attacker who can send a series of specifically crafted packets with a
    connection could cause a denial of service situation by causing the kernel
    to crash.</p>

    <p>Additionally, because the undefined on stack memory may be overwritten by
    other kernel threads, while difficult, it may be possible for an attacker
    to construct a carefully crafted attack to obtain portion of kernel memory
    via a connected socket.  This may result in the disclosure of sensitive
    information such as login credentials, etc. before or even without
    crashing the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3880">CVE-2014-3880</a>

    <p>A local attacker can trigger a kernel crash (triple fault) with potential
    data loss, related to the execve/fexecve system calls.
    Reported by Ivo De Decker.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable (sid) and testing (jessie) distributions, these problems are fixed
in kfreebsd-10 version 10.0-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.</p>
