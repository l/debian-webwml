<p>Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov reported a vulnerability in the
OpenID module of Drupal, a fully-featured content management framework.
A malicious user could exploit this flaw to log in as other users on the
site, including administrators, and hijack their accounts.</p>

<p>These fixes require extra updates to the database which can be done from
the administration pages.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.30-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.</p>
