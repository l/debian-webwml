<p>A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an
IKE/IPsec suite used to establish IPsec protected links.</p>

<p>By sending a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a null pointer
dereference in the daemon parsing the identity, leading to a crash and a
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
