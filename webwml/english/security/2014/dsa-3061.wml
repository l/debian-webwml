<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client:  Multiple memory safety
errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.</p>

<p>This update updates Iceweasel to the ESR31 series of Thunderbird. In
addition Enigmail was updated to version 1.7.2-1~deb7u1 to ensure
compatibility with the new upstream release.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.2.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
