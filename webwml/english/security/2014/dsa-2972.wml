<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace syscall was not verifying the
RIP register to be valid in the ptrace API on x86_64 processors. An
unprivileged user could use this flaw to crash the kernel (resulting in
denial of service) or for privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.60-1+deb7u1. In addition, this update contains several
bugfixes originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
