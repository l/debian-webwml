<p>Jonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the
way wrapped strings are parsed in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input
into an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2+deb7u5.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.1.6-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml packages.</p>
