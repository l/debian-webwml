<p>Nikolaus Rath discovered that s3ql, a file system for online data
storage, used the pickle functionality of the Python programming
language in an unsafe way.  As a result, a malicious storage backend
or man-in-the-middle attacker was able execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.1-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your s3ql packages.</p>
