<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0195">CVE-2014-0195</a>

    <p>Jueri Aedla discovered that a buffer overflow in processing DTLS
    fragments could lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
    of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0221">CVE-2014-0221</a>

    <p>Imre Rad discovered the processing of DTLS hello packets is 
    susceptible to denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0224">CVE-2014-0224</a>

    <p>KIKUCHI Masashi discovered that carefully crafted handshakes can
    force the use of weak keys, resulting in potential man-in-the-middle
    attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3470">CVE-2014-3470</a>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u10. All applications linked to openssl need to
be restarted. You can use the tool checkrestart from the package
debian-goodies to detect affected programs or reboot your system. There's
also a forthcoming security update for the Linux kernel later the day
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3153">CVE-2014-3153</a>), so you need to reboot anyway. Perfect timing, isn't it?</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
