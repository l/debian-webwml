<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an implementation
of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution of arbitrary code,
breakouts of the Java sandbox, information disclosure or denial of service.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in version
6b33-1.13.5-2~deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages and that you
subscribe to <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/">https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/</a> to help test updated
packages before we release them.</p>
