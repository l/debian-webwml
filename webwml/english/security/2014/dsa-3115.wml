<p>Jonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the 
way wrapped strings are parsed in Python-YAML, a YAML parser and emitter 
for Python. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input into an
application using python-yaml could cause the application to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.10-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 3.11-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.11-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pyyaml packages.</p>
