<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update to ffmpeg disables support for over 100 codecs, decoders,
and formats that are rarely used nowadays, for which the support
available in squeeze is most likely insufficient, etc.</p>

<p>This update is only meant to reduce the attack surface.</p>

<p>ffmpeg is otherwise unsupported in squeeze-lts, and any use of it with
untrusted data is highly discouraged.</p>
