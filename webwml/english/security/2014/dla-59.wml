<p>Stephane Chazelas discovered a vulnerability in bash, the GNU
Bourne-Again Shell, related to how environment variables are
processed.  In many common configurations, this vulnerability is
exploitable over the network, especially if bash has been configured
as the system shell.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in bash version 4.1-3+deb6u1</p>
