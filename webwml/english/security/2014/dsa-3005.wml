<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tomáš Trnka discovered a heap-based buffer overflow within the gpgsm
status handler of GPGME, a library designed to make access to GnuPG
easier for applications. An attacker could use this issue to cause an
application using GPGME to crash (denial of service) or possibly to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-1.4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpgme1.0 packages.</p>
