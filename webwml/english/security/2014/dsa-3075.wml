<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured content
management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9015">CVE-2014-9015</a>

    <p>Aaron Averill discovered that a specially crafted request can give a
    user access to another user's session, allowing an attacker to
    hijack a random session.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9016">CVE-2014-9016</a>

    <p>Michael Cullum, Javier Nieto and Andres Rojas Guerrero discovered
    that the password hashing API allows an attacker to send
    specially crafted requests resulting in CPU and memory
    exhaustion. This may lead to the site becoming unavailable or
    unresponsive (denial of service).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Custom configured session.inc and password.inc need to be audited as
well to verify if they are prone to these vulnerabilities. More
information can be found in the upstream advisory at
<url "https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-006" /></p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.</p>
