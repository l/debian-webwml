<p>Evgeny Kotkov discovered a NULL pointer dereference while processing
REPORT requests in mod_dav_svn, the Subversion component which is used
to serve repositories with the Apache web server.  A remote attacker
could abuse this vulnerability for a denial of service.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in subversion version 1.6.12dfsg-7+deb6u1</p>
