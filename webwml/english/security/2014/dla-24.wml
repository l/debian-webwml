<p>It was discovered that poppler did return program execution to the
libjpeg library under error conditions, which is not expected by the
library and results in application crash and possibly code execution.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in poppler version 0.12.4-1.2+squeeze4</p>
