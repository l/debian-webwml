<p>Nicolas Gregoire discovered several vulnerabilities in libxalan2-java,
a Java library for XSLT processing.  Crafted XSLT programs could
access system properties or load arbitrary classes, resulting in
information disclosure and, potentially, arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-5+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-7+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.1-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxalan2-java packages.</p>
