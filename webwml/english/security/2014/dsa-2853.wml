<define-tag description>Remote code execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Pedro Ribeiro from Agile Information Security found a possible remote 
code execution on Horde3, a web application framework. Unsanitized
variables are passed to the unserialize() PHP function. A remote attacker
could specially-craft one of those variables allowing her to load and
execute code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8+debian0-3.</p>

<p>In the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, Horde is 
distributed in the php-horde-util package. This problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1. </p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.</p>
