<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development.</p>

<p>As announced in DSA 3064-1 it has been decided to follow the stable
5.4.x releases for the Wheezy php5 packages. Consequently the
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading PHP to a new upstream version
5.4.36, which includes additional bug fixes, new features and possibly
incompatible changes. Please refer to the upstream changelog for more
information:</p>

<p><url "http://php.net/ChangeLog-5.php#5.4.36"></p>

<p>Two additional patches were applied on top of the imported new upstream
version. An out-of-bounds read flaw was fixed which could lead php5-cgi
to crash. Moreover a bug with php5-pgsql in combination with PostgreSQL
9.1 was fixed 
(<a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=773182">\
Debian Bug #773182</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.36-0+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
