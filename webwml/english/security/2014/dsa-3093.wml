<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7841">CVE-2014-7841</a>

    <p>Liu Wei of Red Hat discovered that a SCTP server doing ASCONF will
    panic on malformed INIT chunks by triggering a NULL pointer
    dereference.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8369">CVE-2014-8369</a>

    <p>A flaw was discovered in the way iommu mapping failures were handled
    in the kvm_iommu_map_pages() function in the Linux kernel. A guest
    OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host
    OS memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact on
    the host OS.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8884">CVE-2014-8884</a>

    <p>A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the
    TechnoTrend/Hauppauge DEC USB driver. A local user with write access
    to the corresponding device could use this flaw to crash the kernel
    or, potentially, elevate their privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9090">CVE-2014-9090</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the do_double_fault function in
    arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel did not properly handle
    faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register,
    which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.63-2+deb7u2. This update also includes fixes for regressions
introduced by previous updates.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
in version 3.16.7-ckt2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
