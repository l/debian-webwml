<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the patch applied to fix <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6271">CVE-2014-6271</a>
released in DSA-3032-1 for bash, the GNU Bourne-Again Shell, was
incomplete and could still allow some characters to be injected into
another environment (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7169">CVE-2014-7169</a>). With this update prefix and suffix
for environment variable names which contain shell functions are added
as hardening measure.</p>

<p>Additionally two out-of-bounds array accesses in the bash parser are
fixed which were revealed in Red Hat's internal analysis for these
issues and also independently reported by Todd Sabin.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2+dfsg-0.1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bash packages.</p>
