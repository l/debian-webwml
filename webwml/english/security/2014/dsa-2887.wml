<p>Aaron Neyer discovered that missing input sanitising in the logging
component of Ruby Actionmailer could result in denial of service through
a malformed e-mail message.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.6-2+deb7u1.ruby-activesupport-3.2 was updated in a related
change to version 3.2.6-6+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.16-3+0 of the rails-3.2 source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-actionmailer-3.2 packages.</p>
