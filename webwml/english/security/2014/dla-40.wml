and SQL injection) have been discovered in Cacti, a web interface for
graphing of monitoring systems.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4002">CVE-2014-4002</a> in the previous security update
has been brought in-line with the upstream fix as it caused a
