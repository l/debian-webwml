<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in a2ps, an <q>Anything to
PostScript</q> converter and pretty-printer. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2001-1593">CVE-2001-1593</a>

    <p>The spy_user function which is called when a2ps is invoked with the
    --debug flag insecurely used temporary files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0466">CVE-2014-0466</a>

    <p>Brian M. Carlson reported that a2ps's fixps script does not invoke
    gs with the -dSAFER option. Consequently executing fixps on a
    malicious PostScript file could result in files being deleted or
    arbitrary commands being executed with the privileges of the user
    running fixps.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.14-1.1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.14-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your a2ps packages.</p>
