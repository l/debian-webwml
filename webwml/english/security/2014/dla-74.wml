<p>This updates fixes a potential integer overflow in option parsing.</p>

<p>A user in the group <q>dip</q> could provide a specially crafted
configuration file of more than 2G and generate an integer overflow.
This may enable an attacker to overwrite the heap and thereby corrupt
security-relevant variables.</p>

<p>See details in the upstream commit:
