<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sogeti found a denial of service flaw in libxml2, a library providing
support to read, modify and write XML and HTML files. A remote attacker
could provide a specially crafted XML file that, when processed by an
application using libxml2, would lead to excessive CPU consumption
(denial of service) based on excessive entity substitutions, even if
entity substitution was disabled, which is the parser default behavior.
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3660">CVE-2014-3660</a>)</p>

<p>In addition, this update addresses a misapplied chunk for a patch
released the previous version (#762864).</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in libxml2 version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze10</p>
