<p>It was discovered that clean_html() function of lxml (pythonic bindings 
for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries) performed insufficient 
sanitisation for some non-printable characters. This could lead to 
cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.2-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lxml packages.</p>
