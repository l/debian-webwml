<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the
transliteration module loading code in eglibc, Debian's version of the
GNU C Library.  As a result, an attacker who can supply a crafted
destination character set argument to iconv-related character
conversation functions could achieve arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>This update removes support of loadable gconv transliteration modules.
Besides the security vulnerability, the module loading code had
functionality defects which prevented it from working for the intended
purpose.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>
