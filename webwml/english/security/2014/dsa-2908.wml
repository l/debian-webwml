<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL. The following
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids identify them:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5298">CVE-2010-5298</a>

    <p>A read buffer can be freed even when it still contains data that is
used later on, leading to a use-after-free. Given a race condition in a
multi-threaded application it may permit an attacker to inject data from
one connection into another or cause denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0076">CVE-2014-0076</a>

    <p>ECDSA nonces can be recovered through the Yarom/Benger FLUSH+RELOAD
cache side-channel attack.</p>

<p>A third issue, with no CVE id, is the missing detection of the
<q>critical</q> flag for the TSA extended key usage under certain cases.</p>


<p>Additionally, this update checks for more services that might need to
be restarted after upgrades of libssl, corrects the detection of
apache2 and postgresql, and adds support for the
'libraries/restart-without-asking' debconf configuration. This allows
services to be restarted on upgrade without prompting.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2010-5298">CVE-2010-5298</a>
and it might be updated at a later time to address the remaining
vulnerabilities.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1g-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
