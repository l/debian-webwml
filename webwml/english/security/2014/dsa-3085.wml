<p>Multiple security issues have been discovered in Wordpress, a web
blogging tool, resulting in denial of service or information disclosure.
More information can be found in the upstream advisory at
<url "https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-0-1/" /></p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9031">CVE-2014-9031</a>

    <p>Jouko Pynnonen discovered an unauthenticated cross site scripting
    vulnerability (XSS) in wptexturize(), exploitable via comments or
    posts.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9033">CVE-2014-9033</a>

    <p>Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the password
    changing process, which could be used by an attacker to trick an
    user into changing her password.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9034">CVE-2014-9034</a>

    <p>Javier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero reported a potential
    denial of service in the way the phpass library is used to handle
    passwords, since no maximum password length was set.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9035">CVE-2014-9035</a>

    <p>John Blackbourn reported an XSS in the <q>Press This</q> function (used
    for quick publishing using a browser <q>bookmarklet</q>).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9036">CVE-2014-9036</a>

    <p>Robert Chapin reported an XSS in the HTML filtering of CSS in posts.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9037">CVE-2014-9037</a>

    <p>David Anderson reported a hash comparison vulnerability for
    passwords stored using the old-style MD5 scheme. While unlikely,
    this could be exploited to compromise an account, if the user had
    not logged in after a Wordpress 2.5 update (uploaded to Debian on 2
    Apr, 2008) and the password MD5 hash could be collided with due to
    PHP dynamic comparison.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9038">CVE-2014-9038</a>

    <p>Ben Bidner reported a server side request forgery (SSRF) in the core
    HTTP layer which unsufficiently blocked the loopback IP address
    space.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9039">CVE-2014-9039</a>

    <p>Momen Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan Slavkovic reported a
    vulnerability in the password reset process: an email address change
    would not invalidate a previous password reset email.</p></li>

</ul>
