<p>An SQL injection vulnerability was discovered in postfixadmin, a web
administration interface for the Postfix Mail Transport Agent, which
allowed authenticated users to make arbitrary manipulations to the
database.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) does not contain postfixadmin.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.5-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postfixadmin packages.</p>
