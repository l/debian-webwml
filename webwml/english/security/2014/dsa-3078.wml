<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer underflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was
found in the ksba_oid_to_str() function of libksba, an X.509 and CMS
(PKCS#7) library. By using special crafted S/MIME messages or ECC based
OpenPGP data, it is possible to create a buffer overflow, which could
cause an application using libksba to crash (denial of service), or
potentially, execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.3.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libksba packages.</p>
