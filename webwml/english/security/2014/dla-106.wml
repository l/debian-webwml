<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in getmail4, a mail retriever
with support for POP3, IMAP4 and SDPS, that could allow man-in-the-middle
attacks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7273">CVE-2014-7273</a>

    <p>The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.43.0 does
    not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive
    information via a crafted certificate.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7274">CVE-2014-7274</a>

    <p>The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify
    that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common
    Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive
    information via a crafted certificate from a recognized Certification
    Authority.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7275">CVE-2014-7275</a>

    <p>The POP3-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.0.0 through 4.44.0 does
    not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows
    man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof POP3 servers and obtain sensitive
    information via a crafted certificate.</p>

<p>For the squeeze distribution, those problems have been fixed by importing
a new upstream version: 4.46.0-1~deb6u1. The updated package has been
prepared by Osamu Aoki.</p>
