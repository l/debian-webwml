<p>Jonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the
way wrapped strings are parsed in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input
into an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash.</p>

<p>This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
libyaml-libyaml-perl package.</p>
