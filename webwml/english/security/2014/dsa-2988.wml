<p>Ben Hawkes discovered that incorrect handling of peer messages in the
Transmission bittorrent client could result in denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.52-3+nmu2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your transmission packages.</p>
