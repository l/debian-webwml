<p>Andrew Drake discovered that missing input sanitising in the icns decoder
of the Python Imaging Library could result in denial of service if a
malformed image is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.7-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.3-1 of the pillow source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-imaging packages.</p>
