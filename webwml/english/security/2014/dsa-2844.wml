<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that djvulibre, the Open Source DjVu implementation
project, can be crashed or possibly make it execute arbitrary code when
processing a specially crafted djvu file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.23-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed before the release of the stable distribution
(wheezy), therefore it is not affected.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.</p>
