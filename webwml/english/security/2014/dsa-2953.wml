<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in dpkg that allow file
modification through path traversal when unpacking source packages with
specially crafted patch files.</p>

<p>This update had been scheduled before the end of security support for
the oldstable distribution (squeeze), hence an exception has been made
and was released through the security archive. However, no further updates
should be expected.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.15.11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.16.15.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
