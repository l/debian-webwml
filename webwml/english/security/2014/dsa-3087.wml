<p>Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat discovered that the blit region checks were
insufficient in the Cirrus VGA emulator in qemu, a fast processor
emulator. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to write into qemu
address space on the host, potentially escalating their privileges to
those of the qemu host process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.</p>
