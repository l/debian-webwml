<p>It was discovered that the web interface in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, incorrectly validated permissions on rss files and
directory index files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue
to bypass file permissions and read arbitrary files, possibly leading
to a privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in cups version 1.4.4-7+squeeze6</p>
