<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor emulator.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4344">CVE-2013-4344</a>

    <p>Buffer overflow in the SCSI implementation in QEMU, 
    when a SCSI controller has more than 256 attached devices, allows
    local users to gain privileges via a small transfer buffer in a
    REPORT LUNS command.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2894">CVE-2014-2894</a>

    <p>Off-by-one error in the cmd_smart function in the smart self test in
    hw/ide/core.c in QEMU allows local users to have
    unspecified impact via a SMART EXECUTE OFFLINE command that triggers
    a buffer underflow and memory corruption.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u3.</p>
