<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full 
virtualization solution on x86 hardware:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Various security issues have been found in the block qemu drivers. 
		Malformed disk images might result in the execution of arbitrary code.</li>
	<li>A NULL pointer dereference in SLIRP may result in denial of service</li>
	<li>An information leak was discovered in the VGA emulation</li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
