<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in charon, the daemon
handling IKEv2 in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite. The state machine
handling the security association (IKE_SA) handled some state transitions
incorrectly.</p>

<p>An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by rekeying an unestablished
IKE_SA during the initiation itself. This will trick the IKE_SA state to
<q>established</q> without the need to provide any valid credential.</p>

<p>Vulnerable setups include those actively initiating IKEv2 IKE_SA (like
”clients” or “roadwarriors”) but also during re-authentication (which
can be initiated by the responder). Installations using IKEv1 (pluto
daemon in strongSwan 4 and earlier, and IKEv1 code in charon 5.x) is not
affected.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
