<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Genkin, Pipman and Tromer discovered a side-channel attack on Elgamal
encryption subkeys 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-5270">\
CVE-2014-5270</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, this update hardens GnuPG's behaviour when treating
keyserver responses; GnuPG now filters keyserver responses to only
accepts those keyid's actually requested by the user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the testing (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem has been fixed in version 1.4.18-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
