<p>Don A. Bailey from Lab Mouse Security discovered an integer overflow
flaw in the way the lzo library decompressed certain archives compressed
with the LZO algorithm. An attacker could create a specially crafted
LZO-compressed input that, when decompressed by an application using the
lzo library, would cause that application to crash or, potentially,
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.06-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lzo2 packages.</p>
