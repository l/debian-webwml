<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of 
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client: Multiple memory safety 
errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation errors
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security 
restrictions or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.3.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
