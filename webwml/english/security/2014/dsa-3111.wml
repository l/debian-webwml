<p>Michal Zalewski discovered an out of bounds write issue in cpio, a tool
for creating and extracting cpio archive files.  In the process of
fixing that issue, the cpio developers found and fixed additional
range checking and null pointer dereference issues.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11+dfsg-0.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.11+dfsg-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cpio packages.</p>
