<p>Jakub Wilk discovered that dpkg did not correctly parse C-style
filename quoting, allowing for paths to be traversed when unpacking a
source package - leading to the creation of files outside the directory
of the source being unpacked.</p>

<p>The update to the stable distribution (wheezy) incorporates
non-security changes that were targeted for the point release 7.5.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.13.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in
version 1.17.8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
