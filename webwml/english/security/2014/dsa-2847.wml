<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a
fully-featured content management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1475">CVE-2014-1475</a>

    <p>Christian Mainka and Vladislav Mladenov reported a vulnerability
    in the OpenID module that allows a malicious user to log in as
    other users on the site, including administrators, and hijack
    their accounts.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1476">CVE-2014-1476</a>

    <p>Matt Vance and Damien Tournoud reported an access bypass
    vulnerability in the taxonomy module. Under certain circumstances,
    unpublished content can appear on listing pages provided by the
    taxonomy module and will be visible to users who should not have
    permission to see it.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>These fixes require extra updates to the database which can be done from
the administration pages. Furthermore this update introduces a new
security hardening element for the form API. Please refer to the
upstream advisory at <a href="https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-001">\
drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-001</a> for further
information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.</p>
