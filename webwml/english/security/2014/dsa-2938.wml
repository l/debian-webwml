<p>The initial organisation and setup of Squeeze LTS has now happened and it is 
ready for taking over security support once the standard security support ends 
at the end of the month:</p>



<h3>Information for users</h3>

<p>Support for Squeeze LTS will end five years after the release of Squeeze, 
i.e. until the 6th of February 2016.</p>

<p>You need to enable the apt sources for <q>squeeze-lts</q> manually. 
Information on how to do this can be found at 
<url "https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Add_squeeze-lts_to_your_sources.list" /></p>

<p>You should also subscribe to the new annoucement mailing list for security 
updates for <q>squeeze-lts</q>:
<url "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/" /></p>

<p>A few packages are not covered by the Squeeze LTS support. These can be
detected with the new tool <kbd>debian-security-support</kbd>. Information on 
how to run it can be found here:
<url "https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Check_for_unsupported_packages" /></p>

<p>If <kbd>debian-security-support</kbd> detects an unsupported package which 
is critical to you, please get in touch with 
<a href="mailto:debian-lts@lists.debian.org">debian-lts@lists.debian.org</a> 
(see below).</p>

<p><q>squeeze-backports</q> will continue to be supported for the lifetime of 
Squeeze LTS.</p>



<h3>Information for Debian maintainers</h3>

<p>First of all, Debian package maintainers are not expected to work on updates 
of their packages for <q>squeeze-lts</q>. Package updates for <q>squeeze-lts</q> 
will be handled by the Debian LTS team.</p>

<p>However, if you <u>are</u> interested in doing so (and the maintainer always
knows best on a package), you're certainly welcome to do so; everyone in the 
Debian.org and Debian maintainers key ring can upload to the <q>squeeze-lts</q> 
suite. Information on how to upload a fixed package can be found at 
<url "https://wiki.debian.org/LTS/Development#Upload_Packages" /></p>



<h3>Mailing lists</h3>

<p>The whole coordination of the Debian LTS effort is handled through the
<q>debian-lts</q> mailing list: <url "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts/" /></p>

<p>Please subscribe or follow us via GMANE (gmane.linux.debian.devel.lts)</p>

<p>Aside from the <q>debian-lts-announce</q> list, there's also a list for 
following all uploads in <q>debian-lts</q>: 
<url "https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-changes/" /></p>



<h3>Security Tracker</h3>

<p>All information on the status of vulnerabilities (e.g. if the version in 
<q>squeeze-lts happens</q> to be unaffected while wheezy is affected) will be 
tracked in the Debian Security Tracker:</p>

<p><url "http://security-tracker.debian.org" /></p>

<p>If you happen to spot an error in the data, please see 
<url "https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report" /></p>
