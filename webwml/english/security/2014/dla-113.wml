<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that bsd-mailx, an implementation of the <q>mail</q>
command, had an undocumented feature which treats syntactically valid
email addresses as shell commands to execute.</p>

<p>Users who need this feature can re-enable it using the <q>expandaddr</q> in
an appropriate mailrc file.  This update also removes the obsolete -T
option.  An older security vulnerability, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771">CVE-2004-2771</a>, had already
been addressed in the Debian's bsd-mailx package.</p>

<p>Note that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities
for command execution, though.  Scripts which send mail to addresses
obtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the
"--" separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work
properly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke
"mail -t" or "sendmail -i -t" instead, passing the recipient addresses
as part of the mail header.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.1.2-0.20100314cvs-1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bsd-mailx packages.</p>
