<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that PHP, a general-purpose scripting language
commonly used for web application development, is vulnerable to a
heap-based buffer overflow in the DNS TXT record parsing. A malicious
server or man-in-the-middle attacker could possibly use this flaw to
execute arbitrary code as the PHP interpreter if a PHP application uses
dns_get_record() to perform a DNS query.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14+deb7u11.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.0~beta4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
