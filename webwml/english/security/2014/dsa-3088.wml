<p>Paolo Bonzini of Red Hat discovered that the blit region checks were
insufficient in the Cirrus VGA emulator in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware. A privileged guest user could
use this flaw to write into qemu address space on the host, potentially
escalating their privileges to those of the qemu host process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
