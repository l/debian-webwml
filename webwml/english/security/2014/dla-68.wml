     <p>When inserting encoded newline characters into a request to rup,
     additional HTTP headers can be injected into the reply, as well
     as new HTML code on the top of the website.</p>

<p>[<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3876">CVE-2014-3876</a>]
     The parameter akey is reflected unfiltered as part of the HTML
     page.  Some characters are forbidden in the GET parameter due
     to filtering of the URL, but this can be circumvented by using
     a POST parameter.
     Nevertheless, this issue is exploitable via the GET parameter
     alone, with some user interaction.</p>

     the user as part of the HTML page. Some characters are forbidden
     in the GET parameter due to filtering of the URL, but this can
     be circumvented by using a POST parameter. Nevertheless, this
     issue is exploitable via the GET parameter alone, with some user
     interaction.</p>
