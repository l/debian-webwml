<define-tag description>incorrect certificate verification</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nikos Mavrogiannopoulos of Red Hat discovered an X.509 certificate
verification issue in GnuTLS, an SSL/TLS library. A certificate
validation could be reported sucessfully even in cases were an error
would prevent all verification steps to be performed.</p>

<p>An attacker doing a man-in-the-middle of a TLS connection could use this
vulnerability to present a carefully crafted certificate that would be
accepted by GnuTLS as valid even if not signed by one of the trusted
authorities.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.23-13.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.23-13.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
