<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
  <p>Fernando Russ from Groundworks Technologies reported a buffer overflow
  flaw in srtp, Cisco's reference implementation of the Secure Real-time
  Transport Protocol (SRTP), in how the
  crypto_policy_set_from_profile_for_rtp() function applies
  cryptographic profiles to an srtp_policy. A remote attacker could
  exploit this vulnerability to crash an application linked against
  libsrtp, resulting in a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4~dfsg-6+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4+20100615~dfsg-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~20130609~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your srtp packages.</p>
