<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in
the HTTP transport code in apt-get. An attacker able to
man-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the
buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the <q>http</q> apt method binary, or
potentially to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>The following regression fixes were included in this update:</p>

 <p>* Fix regression from the previous update in DLA-53-1 when the custom
   apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a relative
   path (#762160).</p>

 <p>* Fix regression in the reverificaiton handling of cdrom: sources that
   may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run
   "apt-cdrom add" again after the update was applied.</p>

 <p>* Fix regression from the previous update in DLA-53-1 when file:///
   sources are used and those are on a different partition than the apt
   state directory.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in apt version 0.8.10.3+squeeze5</p>
