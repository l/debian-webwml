<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update fixes a regression introduced in 0.8.10.3+squeeze5 where
apt would send invalid HTTP requests when sending If-Range queries.</p>

<p>For reference, the original advisory text follows.</p>

<p>The Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in
the HTTP transport code in apt-get. An attacker able to
man-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the
buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the <q>http</q> apt method binary, or
potentially to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>The following regression fixes were included in this update:</p>

 <p>* Fix regression from the previous update in <a href="dla-53">DLA-53-1</a>
   when the custom apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a
   relative path (#762160).</p>

 <p>* Fix regression in the reverificaiton handling of cdrom: sources that
   may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run
   "apt-cdrom add" again after the update was applied.</p>

 <p>* Fix regression from the previous update in <a href="dla-53">DLA-53-1</a>
   when file:/// sources are used and those are on a different partition than
   the apt state directory.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in apt version 0.8.10.3+squeeze6</p>
