<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0472">CVE-2014-0472</a>

    <p>Benjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted
    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An
    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django
    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary
    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0473">CVE-2014-0473</a>

    <p>Paul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain
    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this
    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass
    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0474">CVE-2014-0474</a>

    <p>Michael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes
    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which
    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1418">CVE-2014-1418</a>

    <p>Michael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that
    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to
    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve
    private data or poison caches.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3730">CVE-2014-3730</a>

    <p>Peter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly
    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may
    use this to cause unexpected redirects.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
