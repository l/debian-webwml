<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dragana Damjanovic discovered that an authenticated client could crash
an OpenVPN server by sending a control packet containing less than
four bytes as payload.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.3-2+squeeze3 in squeeze-lts.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openvpn packages.</p>
