<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A regression has been identified in the python2.6 update of DLA-25-1,
which may cause python applications to abort if they were running during
the upgrade but they had not already imported the 'os' module, and do so
after the upgrade. This update fixes this upgrade scenario.</p>

<p>For reference, the original advisory text follows.</p>

<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in python2.6. The more
relevant are:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4238">CVE-2013-4238</a>

    <p>Incorrect handling of NUL bytes in certificate hostnames may allow
    server spoofing via specially-crafted certificates signed by
    a trusted Certification Authority.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1912">CVE-2014-1912</a>

    <p>Buffer overflow in socket.recvfrom_into leading to application
    crash and possibly code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in python2.6 version 2.6.6-8+deb6u2</p>
