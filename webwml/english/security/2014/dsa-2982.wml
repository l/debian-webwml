<p>Sean Griffin discovered two vulnerabilities in the PostgreSQL adapter 
for Active Record which could lead to SQL injection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.6-5+deb7u1. Debian provides two variants of <q>Ruby on Rails</q> 
in Wheezy (2.3 and 3.2). Support for the 2.3 variants had to be ceased 
at this point. This affects the following source packages: 
ruby-actionmailer-2.3, ruby-actionpack-2.3 ruby-activerecord-2.3, 
ruby-activeresource-2.3, ruby-activesupport-2.3 and ruby-rails-2.3. The
version of Redmine in Wheezy still requires 2.3, you can use an updated
version from backports.debian.org which is compatible with rails 3.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.19-1 of the rails-3.2 source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-activerecord-3.2 packages.</p>
