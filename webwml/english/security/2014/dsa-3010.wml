<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0480">CVE-2014-0480</a>

    <p>Florian Apolloner discovered that in certain situations, URL
    reversing could generate scheme-relative URLs which could
    unexpectedly redirect a user to a different host, leading to
    phishing attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0481">CVE-2014-0481</a>

    <p>David Wilson reported a file upload denial of service vulnerability.
    Django's file upload handling in its default configuration may
    degrade to producing a huge number of `os.stat()` system calls when
    a duplicate filename is uploaded. A remote attacker with the ability
    to upload files can cause poor performance in the upload handler,
    eventually causing it to become very slow.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0482">CVE-2014-0482</a>

    <p>David Greisen discovered that under some circumstances, the use of
    the RemoteUserMiddleware middleware and the RemoteUserBackend
    authentication backend could result in one user receiving another
    user's session, if a change to the REMOTE_USER header occurred
    without corresponding logout/login actions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0483">CVE-2014-0483</a>

    <p>Collin Anderson discovered that it is possible to reveal any field's
    data by modifying the <q>popup</q> and <q>to_field</q> parameters of the query
    string on an admin change form page. A user with access to the admin
    interface, and with sufficient knowledge of model structure and the
    appropriate URLs, could construct popup views which would display
    the values of non-relationship fields, including fields the
    application developer had not intended to expose in such a fashion.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
