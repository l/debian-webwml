<p>A flaw was discovered in mutt, a text-based mailreader. A specially
crafted mail header could cause mutt to crash, leading to a denial of
service condition.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.21-6.2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.23-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mutt packages.</p>
