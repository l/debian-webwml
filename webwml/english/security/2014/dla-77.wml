<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libtasn1-3, a library that
manages ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. An attacker
could use those to cause a denial-of-service via out-of-bounds access
or NULL pointer dereference.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in libtasn1-3 version 2.7-1+squeeze+2</p>
