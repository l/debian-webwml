<p>Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered multiple
vulnerabilities in the pdftoopvp CUPS filter, which could result in the
execution of aribitrary code if a malformed PDF file is processed.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid)
the filter is now part of the cups-filters source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
