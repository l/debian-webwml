<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5606">CVE-2013-5606</a>

    <p>Certificate validation with the verifylog mode did not return
    validation errors, but instead expected applications to determine

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1491">CVE-2014-1491</a>

    <p>Ticket handling protection mechanisms bypass due to the lack of

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1492">CVE-2014-1492</a>

    <p>Incorrect IDNA domain name matching for wildcard certificates could

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1+deb7u1.</p>
