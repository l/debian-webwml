<p>Joonas Kuorilehto discovered that GNU TLS performed insufficient 
validation of session IDs during TLS/SSL handshakes. A malicious server
could use this to execute arbitrary code or perform denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.23-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
