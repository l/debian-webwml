<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Martin Holst Swende discovered a flaw in the way chunked requests are
handled in ModSecurity, an Apache module whose purpose is to tighten the
Web application security. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
bypass intended mod_security restrictions by using chunked transfer
coding with a capitalized Chunked value in the Transfer-Encoding HTTP
header, allowing to send requests containing content that should have
been removed by mod_security.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.6-6+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.7-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your modsecurity-apache packages.</p>
