<p>Jared Mauch reported a denial of service flaw in the way BIND, a DNS
server, handled queries for NSEC3-signed zones. A remote attacker could
use this flaw against an authoritative name server that served
NCES3-signed zones by sending a specially crafted query, which, when
processed, would cause named to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
