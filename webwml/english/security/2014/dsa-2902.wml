<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0138">CVE-2014-0138</a>

    <p>Steve Holme discovered that libcurl can in some circumstances re-use
    the wrong connection when asked to do transfers using other
    protocols than HTTP and FTP.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0139">CVE-2014-0139</a>

    <p>Richard Moore from Westpoint Ltd. reported that libcurl does not
    behave compliant to RFC 2828 under certain conditions and
    incorrectly validates wildcard SSL certificates containing literal
    IP addresses.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.36.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
