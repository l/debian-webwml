<p>Francisco Falcon discovered that missing input sanitizing in the 3D 
acceleration code in VirtualBox could lead to the execution of arbitrary 
code on the host system.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.10-dfsg-1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.18-dfsg-2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.10-dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.10-dfsg-1.</p>
