<p>It was discovered that file, a file type classification tool, contains a
flaw in the handling of <q>indirect</q> magic rules in the libmagic library,
which leads to an infinite recursion when trying to determine the file
type of certain files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
ID <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1943">CVE-2014-1943</a> has been assigned to identify this flaw. Additionally,
other well-crafted files might result in long computation times (while
using 100% CPU) and overlong results.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.04-5+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.</p>
