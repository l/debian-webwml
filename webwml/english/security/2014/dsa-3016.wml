<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap-based overflow vulnerability was found in the way Lua, a
simple, extensible, embeddable programming language, handles varargs
functions with many fixed parameters called with few arguments,
leading to application crashes or, potentially, arbitrary code
execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lua5.2 packages.</p>
