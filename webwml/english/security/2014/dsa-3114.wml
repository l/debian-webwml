<p>Timothy D. Morgan discovered that run-mailcap, an utility to execute
programs via entries in the mailcap file, is prone to shell command
injection via shell meta-characters in filenames. In specific scenarios
this flaw could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.52-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.</p>
