<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Martin Holst Swende discovered a flaw in the way mod_security handled chunked
requests. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass intended mod_security
restrictions, allowing them to send requests containing content that should
have been removed by mod_security.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in libapache-mod-security version 2.5.12-1+squeeze4</p>
