<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>New upstream minor release. Users should upgrade to this version at their next
scheduled maintenance window.</p>

<p>Noteworthy change:</p>

 <p>Secure Unix-domain sockets of temporary postmasters started during make
 check (Noah Misch)</p>

 <p>Any local user able to access the socket file could connect as the server's
 bootstrap superuser, then proceed to execute arbitrary code as the
 operating-system user running the test, as we previously noted in
 <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0067">CVE-2014-0067</a>. This change defends against that risk by placing the server's
 socket in a temporary, mode 0700 subdirectory of /tmp.</p>

<p>8.4.22 marks the end of life of the PostgreSQL 8.4 branch. No further
releases will be made by the PostgreSQL Global Development Group.</p>

<p>Users of PostgreSQL 8.4 should look into upgrading to a newer PostgreSQL
release. Options are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgrading to Debian 7 (Wheezy), providing postgresql-9.1.</li>

<li><p>The use of the apt.postgresql.org repository, providing packages for all
  active PostgreSQL branches (9.0 up to 9.4 at the time of writing).</p>

  <p>See <a href="https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt">https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt</a> for more information about the
  repository.</p>

  <p>A helper script to activate the repository is provided in
  /usr/share/doc/postgresql-8.4/examples/apt.postgresql.org.sh.</p>
</li>
<li>An LTS version of 8.4 is in planning that will cover the lifetime of
  squeeze-lts. Updates will probably made on a best-effort basis. Users can
  take advantage of this, but should still consider upgrading to newer
  PostgreSQL versions over the next months.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in postgresql-8.4 version 8.4.22-0+deb6u1</p>
