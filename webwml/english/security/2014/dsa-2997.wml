<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Wilk discovered a remote command execution flaw in reportbug, a
tool to report bugs in the Debian distribution. A man-in-the-middle
attacker could put shell metacharacters in the version number allowing
arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user running
reportbug.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4.4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5.0+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your reportbug packages.</p>
