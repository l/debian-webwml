<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous
inter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3477">CVE-2014-3477</a>

    <p>Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an
    AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the
    client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker
    could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not
    currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users
    access to this service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3532">CVE-2014-3532</a>

    <p>Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's
    support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force
    system services or user applications to be disconnected from the
    D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,
    leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3533">CVE-2014-3533</a>

    <p>Alban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro Martinez Suarez
    discovered that a malicious process could force services to be
    disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt
    to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to
    a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8-1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.</p>
