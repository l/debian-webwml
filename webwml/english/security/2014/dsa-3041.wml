<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been discovered in the Xen virtualisation
solution which may result in denial of service, information disclosure
or privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
