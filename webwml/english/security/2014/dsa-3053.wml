<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the Secure Sockets
Layer library and toolkit.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3513">CVE-2014-3513</a>

    <p>A memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure
    Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker
    could send multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust
    all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566">CVE-2014-3566 ("POODLE")</a>

    <p>A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when
    decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
    chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
    attacker to decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256
    tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send
    the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections. </p>

    <p>This update adds support for Fallback SCSV to mitigate this issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3567">CVE-2014-3567</a>

    <p>A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed
    session ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all
    available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number
    of invalid session tickets to that server. </p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3568">CVE-2014-3568</a>

    <p>When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u13.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1j-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
