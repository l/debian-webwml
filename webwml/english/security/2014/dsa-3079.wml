<p>A vulnerability was discovered in ppp, an implementation of the
Point-to-Point Protocol: an integer overflow in the routine
responsible for parsing user-supplied options potentially allows a
local attacker to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.</p>
