<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in the Icinga host and network
monitoring system (buffer overflows, cross-site request forgery, off-by
ones) which could result in the execution of arbitrary code, denial of
service or session hijacking.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.1-7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.11.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.11.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icinga packages.</p>
