<define-tag description>certificate verification flaw</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Suman Jana reported that GnuTLS, deviating from the documented behavior,
considers a version 1 intermediate certificate as a CA certificate by
default.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem as
X.509 version 1 trusted CA certificates are not allowed by default.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.12.23-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
