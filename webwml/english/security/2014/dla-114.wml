<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security vulnerabilities were discovered in Heirloom mailx, an
implementation of the <q>mail</q> command:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-2771">CVE-2004-2771</a>

    <p>mailx interprets shell meta-characters in certain email
    addresses.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7844">CVE-2014-7844</a>

    <p>An unexpected feature of mailx treats syntactically valid email
    addresses as shell commands to execute.</p>

<p>Shell command execution can be re-enabled using the <q>expandaddr</q>
option.</p>

<p>Note that this security update does not remove all mailx facilities
for command execution, though.  Scripts which send mail to addresses
obtained from an untrusted source (such as a web form) should use the
"--" separator before the email addresses (which was fixed to work
properly in this update), or they should be changed to invoke
"mail -t" or "sendmail -i -t" instead, passing the recipient addresses
as part of the mail header.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 12.4-2+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heirloom-mailx packages.</p>
