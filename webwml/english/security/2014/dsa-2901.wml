    <p>A user with a contributor role, using a specially crafted
    request, can publish posts, which is reserved for users of the
    next-higher role.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0166">CVE-2014-0166</a>

    <p>Jon Cave of the WordPress security team discovered that the
    wp_validate_auth_cookie function in wp-includes/pluggable.php does
    not properly determine the validity of authentication cookies,
    allowing a remote attacker to obtain access via a forged cookie.</p></li>
