<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered in mumble, a low latency VoIP
client. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0044">CVE-2014-0044</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a NULL pointer dereference or an
    out-of-bounds array access. A malicious remote attacker could
    exploit this flaw to mount a denial of service attack against a
    mumble client by causing the application to crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0045">CVE-2014-0045</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a malformed Opus voice packet sent to a
    Mumble client could trigger a heap-based buffer overflow. A
    malicious remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a client
    crash (denial of service) or potentially use it to execute
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-349-g315b5f5-2.2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mumble packages.</p>
