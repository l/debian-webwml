<p>Paras Sethia discovered that libcurl, a client-side URL transfer
library, would sometimes mix up multiple HTTP and HTTPS connections
with NTLM authentication to the same server, sending requests for one
user over the connection authenticated as a different user.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.35.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
