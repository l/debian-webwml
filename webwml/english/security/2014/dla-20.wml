<p>[ Christoph Biedl ]
* munin-node: more secure state file handling, introducing a new plugin
  state directory root, owned by uid 0. Then each plugin runs in its own
  UID plugin state directory, owned by that UID. (Closes: #684075),
  (Closes: #679897), closes <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3512">CVE-2012-3512</a>.
* plugins: use runtime $ENV{MUNIN_PLUGSTATE}. So all properly written
  plugins will use /var/lib/munin-node/plugin-state/$uid/$some_file now   please report plugins that are still using /var/lib/munin/plugin-state/   as those  might pose a security risk!
* Validate multigraph plugin name, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6048">CVE-2013-6048</a>.
* Don't abort data collection for a node due to malicious node, fixing
  munin#1397, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6359">CVE-2013-6359</a>.</p>
