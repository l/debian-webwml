<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefano Zacchiroli discovered a vulnerability in exuberant-ctags, a tool
to build tag file indexes of source code definitions: Certain JavaScript
files cause ctags to enter an infinite loop until it runs out of disk 
space, resulting in denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.9~svn20110310-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exuberant-ctags packages.</p>
