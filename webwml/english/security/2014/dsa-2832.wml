<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in memcached, a high-performance
memory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-4971">CVE-2011-4971</a>

    <p>Stefan Bucur reported that memcached could be caused to crash by
    sending a specially crafted packet.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239">CVE-2013-7239</a>

    <p>It was reported that SASL authentication could be bypassed due to a
    flaw related to the managment of the SASL authentication state. With
    a specially crafted request, a remote attacker may be able to
    authenticate with invalid SASL credentials.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb6u1. Note that the patch for <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7239">CVE-2013-7239</a> was not
applied for the oldstable distribution as SASL support is not enabled in
this version. This update also provides the fix for <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0179">CVE-2013-0179</a> which
was fixed for stable already.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.13-0.2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.</p>
