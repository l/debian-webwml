<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Francisco Alonso of Red Hat Product Security found an issue in the file
utility: when checking ELF files, note headers are incorrectly checked,
thus potentially allowing attackers to cause a denial of service
(out-of-bounds read and application crash) by supplying a specially
crafted ELF file.</p>

<p>For the long-term stable distribution (squeeze-lts), this problem has been
fixed in version 5.04-5+squeeze8.</p>
