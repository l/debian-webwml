<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and SSL/TLS
library, which can be exploited by a remote unauthenticated attacker to
mount a denial of service against PolarSSL servers that offer GCM
ciphersuites. Potentially clients are affected too if a malicious server
decides to execute the denial of service attack against its clients.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.7-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.7-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.</p>
