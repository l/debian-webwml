<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.</p>

<p>This update corrects this flaw in the copy that is embedded in the
libyaml-libyaml-perl package.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.33-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.38-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.41-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml-libyaml-perl packages.</p>
