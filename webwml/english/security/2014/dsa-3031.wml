<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in
the HTTP transport code in apt-get. An attacker able to
man-in-the-middle a HTTP request to an apt repository can trigger the
buffer overflow, leading to a crash of the <q>http</q> apt method binary, or
potentially to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>Two regression fixes were included in this update:</p>

<ul>
 <li><p>Fix regression from the previous update in DSA-3025-1 when the custom
   apt configuration option for Dir::state::lists is set to a relative
   path (#762160).</p></li>

 <li><p>Fix regression in the reverificaiton handling of cdrom: sources that
   may lead to incorrect hashsum warnings. Affected users need to run
   "apt-cdrom add" again after the update was applied.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7.9+deb7u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt packages.</p>
