<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3538">CVE-2014-3538</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the original fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7345">CVE-2013-7345</a> did not
    sufficiently address the problem. A remote attacker could still
    cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a specially-crafted
    input file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk
    regular expression rule.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3587">CVE-2014-3587</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the CDF parser of the fileinfo module does
    not properly process malformed files in the Composite Document File
    (CDF) format, leading to crashes.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3597">CVE-2014-3597</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the original fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4049">CVE-2014-4049</a> did not
    completely address the issue. A malicious server or
    man-in-the-middle attacker could cause a denial of service (crash)
    and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted DNS TXT record.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4670">CVE-2014-4670</a>

    <p>It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain SPL
    Iterators. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to
    crash, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in php5 version 5.3.3-7+squeeze22</p>
