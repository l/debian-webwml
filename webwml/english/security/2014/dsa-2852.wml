<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yves Younan and Ryan Pentney discovered that libgadu, a library for
accessing the Gadu-Gadu instant messaging service, contained an
integer overflow leading to a buffer overflow.  Attackers which
impersonate the server could crash clients and potentially execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.9.0-2+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.11.2-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.11.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgadu packages.</p>
