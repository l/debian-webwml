<p>Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities have been discovered
in extplorer, a web file explorer and manager using Ext JS.
A remote attacker can inject arbitrary web script or HTML code via a
crafted string in the URL to application.js.php, admin.php, copy_move.php,
functions.php, header.php and upload.php.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.2-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0b6+dfsg.3-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your extplorer packages.</p>
