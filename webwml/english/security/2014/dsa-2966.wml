<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered and fixed in Samba, a SMB/CIFS
file, print, and login server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0178">CVE-2014-0178</a>

    <p>Information leak vulnerability in the VFS code, allowing an
    authenticated user to retrieve eight bytes of uninitialized memory
    when shadow copy is enabled.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0244">CVE-2014-0244</a>

    <p>Denial of service (infinite CPU loop) in the nmbd Netbios name
    service daemon. A malformed packet can cause the nmbd server to
    enter an infinite loop, preventing it to process later requests to
    the Netbios name service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3493">CVE-2014-3493</a>

    <p>Denial of service (daemon crash) in the smbd file server daemon. An
    authenticated user attempting to read a Unicode path using a
    non-Unicode request can force the daemon to overwrite memory at an
    invalid address.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.1.9+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
