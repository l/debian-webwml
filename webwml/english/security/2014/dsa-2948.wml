<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Bottle, a WSGI-framework for Python, performed
a too permissive detection of JSON content, resulting a potential
bypass of security mechanisms.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.11-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-bottle packages.</p>
