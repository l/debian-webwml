<p>Jouni Malinen discovered an input sanitization issue in the wpa_cli and
hostapd_cli tools included in the wpa package.  A remote wifi system
within range could provide a crafted string triggering arbitrary code
execution running with privileges of the affected wpa_cli or hostapd_cli
process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.</p>
