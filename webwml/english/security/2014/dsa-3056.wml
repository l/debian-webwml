<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in libtasn1-3, a library that
manages ASN1 (Abstract Syntax Notation One) structures. An attacker
could use those to cause a denial-of-service via out-of-bounds access
or NULL pointer dereference.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.</p>
