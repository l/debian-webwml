<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566">CVE-2014-3566</a>

<p>("POODLE")</p>

    <p>A flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when
    decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block
    chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM)
    attacker to decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256
    tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly
    send the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections.</p>

    <p>This update adds support for Fallback SCSV to mitigate this issue.
    This does not fix the issue.  The proper way to fix this is to
    disable SSL 3.0.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3567">CVE-2014-3567</a>

    <p>A memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed
    session ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all
    available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number
    of invalid session tickets to that server.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3568">CVE-2014-3568</a>

    <p>When OpenSSL is configured with "no-ssl3" as a build option, servers
    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be
    configured to send them.</p>

    <p>Note that the package is Debian is not build with this option.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3569">CVE-2014-3569</a>

    <p>When openssl is build with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL v3 Client
    Hello is received the ssl method would be set to NULL which could
    later result in a NULL pointer dereference.</p>

    <p>Note that the package is Debian is not build with this option.</p></li>
