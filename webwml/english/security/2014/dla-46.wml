<p>Boris <q>pi</q> Piwinger and Tavis Ormandy reported a heap overflow
vulnerability in procmail's formail utility when processing
specially-crafted email headers. A remote attacker could use this flaw
to cause formail to crash, resulting in a denial of service or data
loss, or possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in procmail version 3.22-19+deb6u1</p>
