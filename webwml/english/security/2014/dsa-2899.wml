<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michael Meffie discovered that in OpenAFS, a distributed filesystem,
an attacker with the ability to connect to an OpenAFS fileserver can
trigger a buffer overflow, crashing the fileserver, and potentially
permitting the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>In addition, this update addresses a minor denial of service issue:
the listener thread of the server will hang for about one second when
receiving an invalid packet, giving the opportunity to slow down
the server to an unusable state by sending such packets.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.</p>
