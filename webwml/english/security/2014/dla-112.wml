<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update fixes a denial of service vulnerability in BIND, a DNS server.</p>

<p>By making use of maliciously-constructed zones or a rogue server, an attacker
could exploit an oversight in the code BIND 9 used to follow delegations in
the Domain Name Service, causing BIND to issue unlimited queries in an attempt
to follow the delegation.</p>

<p>This can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service (up to and
including termination of the named server process).</p>
