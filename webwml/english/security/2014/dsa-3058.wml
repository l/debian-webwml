<p>Chad Vizino reported a vulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch
processing queueing system. A non-root user could exploit the flaw in
the tm_adopt() library call to kill any process, including root-owned
ones on any node in a job.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.</p>
