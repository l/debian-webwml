<p>Michael Niedermayer discovered a vulnerability in xbuffy, an utility for
displaying message count in mailbox and newsgroup accounts.</p>

<p>By sending carefully crafted messages to a mail or news account
monitored by xbuffy, an attacker can trigger a stack-based buffer
overflow, leading to xbuffy crash or even remote code execution.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-8+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-8+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.bl.3.dfsg-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xbuffy packages.</p>
