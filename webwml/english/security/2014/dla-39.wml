<p>Tomas Trnka discovered a heap-based buffer overflow within the gpgsm
status handler of GPGME, a library designed to make access to GnuPG
easier for applications. An attacker could use this issue to cause an
application using GPGME to crash (denial of service) or possibly to
execute arbitrary code.</p>
