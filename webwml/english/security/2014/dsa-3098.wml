<p>Joshua Rogers discovered a format string vulnerability in the yyerror
function in lib/cgraph/scan.l in Graphviz, a rich set of graph drawing
tools. An attacker could use this flaw to cause graphviz to crash or
possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.26.3-14+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon in version 2.38.0-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.38.0-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your graphviz packages.</p>
