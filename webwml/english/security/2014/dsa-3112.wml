<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michele Spagnuolo of the Google Security Team dicovered two heap-based
buffer overflows in SoX, the Swiss Army knife of sound processing
programs. A specially crafted wav file could cause an application using
SoX to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 14.4.0-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sox packages.</p>
