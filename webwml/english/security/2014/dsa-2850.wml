<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a
heap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and
emitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a
specially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,
would cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user running the application.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.3-1+deb6u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.1.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libyaml packages.</p>
