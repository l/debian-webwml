<p>Jean-Ren√© Reinhard, Olivier Levillain and Florian Maury reported that
GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard, did not properly parse certain garbled
compressed data packets. A remote attacker could use this flaw to mount
a denial of service against GnuPG by triggering an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.19-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.24-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.24-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 packages.</p>
