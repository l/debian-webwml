<define-tag description>directory traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A directory traversal attack was reported against libtar, a C library for
manipulating tar archives. The application does not validate the
filenames inside the tar archive, allowing to extract files in arbitrary
path. An attacker can craft a tar file to override files beyond the
tar_extract_glob and tar_extract_all prefix parameter.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.11-6+deb6u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.16-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.20-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtar packages.</p>
