<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple issues have been identified in cpio, including a buffer overflow
and multiple NULL pointer dereference, resulting at least in a denial of
service and possibly also in an unwanted code execution.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in Debian 6 Squeeze with version 2.11-4+deb6u1 by
applying the upstream patches.
