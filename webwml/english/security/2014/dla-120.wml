For reference, the original advisory text follows.</p>

<p>Ilja van Sprundel of IOActive discovered several security issues in the
X.org X server, which may lead to privilege escalation or denial of
service.</p>

version 2:1.7.7-18+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.</p>
