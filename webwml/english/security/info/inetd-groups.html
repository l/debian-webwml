While we're at it: many inetds don't clear the groups list when they
start up, so that if you kill and restart inetd from your root shell
inetd subprocesses may inherit additional (probably privileged)
groups. <p>

I don't know if FreeBSD's inetd suffers from this problem, but the
currently released Linux one does. (The next release won't; if there's
interest I can post the patch.) <p>

The impact of this problem is fortunately fairly limited, and there's
not usually any real reason for root to be in a whole stack of groups. <p>
