<p>The following vulnerabilities were discovered during the lifetime
of Debian GNU/Linux 4.0 alias etch.  However, this distribution is
not vulnerable to them for one reason or another.  Common reasons are
too old versions in etch or non-existing packages.  They are listed
here since other vendors were affected or have released an advisory on
their own.  This way, our users can see whether Debian is vulnerable
even if no Debian advisory was issued.</p>
