<define-tag moreinfo>We have received reports about two buffer overflows in the
super package which was distributed as part of Debian GNU/Linux.  Firstly, for
per-user .supertab files super didn't check for a buffer overflow when creating
the path to the user's .supertab file.  Secondly another buffer overflow did
allow ordinary users to overflow super by creating a nasty personal .supertab
file.  We recommend you upgrade your super packages immediately.

<p>An analysis of the super vulnerability is available at this
