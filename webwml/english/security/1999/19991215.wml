A buffer overflow was reported in the beta of Qualcomm's qpopper version 3.
This version of qpopper is not included in Debian; the version of qpopper
shipped with Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (qpopper 2.3-4) is <em>not</em> vulnerable
to the overflow.

<p>The vulnerability is caused by not bounds checking the input buffers, when
using vsprintf or sprintf.  For details see the 
<a href="http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/1999/12/msg00009.html">Stuttgart BugTraq archive</a> or
the <a href="http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/36847/1999-11-27/1999-12-03/2">SecurityFocus archive</a>.  Both 
links refer to the same email from  Qpopper Support at Qualcomm and include
the original bug report from Mixter.
