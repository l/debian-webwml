<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of nfs-server that was distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 had a buffer overflow in fh_buildpath(). It assumed that the
total length of a path would never exceed (PATH_MAX_NAME_MAX). With a
read/write exported directory, people could create longer paths and cause a
buffer overflow.

<p>This has been addressed in version 2.2beta37-1slink.1, and we recommend you
upgrade your nfs-server package immediately.</define-tag>
