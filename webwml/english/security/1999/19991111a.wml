<define-tag moreinfo>The proftpd version that was distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 had several buffer overruns that could be exploited by remote
attackers. A short list of problems:
<ul>
<li>user input was used in snprintf() without sufficient checks
<li>there was an overflow in the log_xfer() routine
<li>you could overflow a buffer by using very long pathnames
</ul>
<p>Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
<p>In addition to the security fixes a couple of Y2K problems were also fixed.

<p>See this <a href="http://lists.suse.com/archive/suse-security/1999-Sep/0052.html">SUSE Security (1999 Sep 0052) announcement</a>
and <a href="http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/1999/Sep/0337.html">BugTraq lists (1999 Sep 0337)</a>, for additional information. 

<p>We have made a new package with version 1.2.0pre9-4 to address these
issues, and we recommend to upgrade your proftpd package immediately.
