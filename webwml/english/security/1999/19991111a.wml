<define-tag description>buffer overflows in proftpd</define-tag>
<define-tag isvulnerable>yes</define-tag>
<define-tag fixed>yes</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>The proftpd version that was distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 had several buffer overruns that could be exploited by remote
attackers. A short list of problems:
<ul>
<li>user input was used in snprintf() without sufficient checks
<li>there was an overflow in the log_xfer() routine
<li>you could overflow a buffer by using very long pathnames
</ul>
<p>Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
<p>In addition to the security fixes a couple of Y2K problems were also fixed.
<p>We have made a new package with version 1.2.0pre9-4 to address these
issues, and we recommend to upgrade your proftpd package immediately.
