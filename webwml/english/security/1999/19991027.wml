<define-tag moreinfo>The nis package that was distributed with Debian GNU/Linux
2.1 has a couple of problems: 
<ul>
<li>ypserv allowed any machine in the NIS domain to insert new tables
<li>rpc.yppasswd had a bufferoverflow in its MD5 code
<li>rpc.yppasswd allowed users to change the GECOS and loginshell entries of other users
</ul>
This has been fixed in version 3.5-2. We recommend you upgrade your nis
package immediately. </define-tag>
