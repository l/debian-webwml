An advisory released by Core-SDI indicates that a
combination of bugs in ssh and the rsaref2 library can be exploited to gain
remote access to a host running the vulnerable program. The version of ssh in
Debian is <em>not</em> linked against rsaref2, and is <em>not</em> vulnerable
as shipped. Note that if you compile a local copy of ssh with the rsaref2
library, your local copy may be vulnerable. See the advisory at <a
href="http://www1.corest.com/common/showdoc.php?idx=130&amp;idxseccion=10&amp;CORE=17f28e005bf48e41503333f6d8aa3d15">CoreLabs Advisories - CORE-1201999</a>
for more information.

<p>Any software that uses the rsaref2 library could be vulnerable.
