<define-tag moreinfo>An advisory released by Core-SDI indicates that a
combination of bugs in ssh and the rsaref2 library can be exploited to gain
remote access to a host running the vulnerable program. The version of ssh in
debian is <em>not</em> linked against rsaref2, and is <em>not</em> vulnerable
as shipped. Note that if you compile a local copy of ssh with the rsaref2
library your local copy may be vulnerable. See the advisory at <a
href=http://www.core-sdi.com/advisories/buffer_over_ing.htm>http://www.core-sdi.com/advisories/buffer_over_ing.htm</a>
for more information.</define-tag>
