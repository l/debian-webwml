We have found that the ftpwatch package as distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 1.3 and later distributions has a security problem which makes
it trivial for users to gain root access.

<p>We recommend that you remove the ftpwatch package immediately.

<p>We will be working on a new version of ftpwatch to address these issues and
will announce that in a new advisory.

<p><em>A new advisory was never issued. The updated package is available in
newer distributions, and its Debian README file contains this:</em>

<pre>
Due to security problems FTPWatch no longer installs itself in the
root crontab file. But every user who wants to use it has to place it
in their own crontabs. To get a weekly update as before the following
line could be used:

  47 5    * * 7 /usr/sbin/ftpwatch

This also means that all files in ~/.ftpwatch/ has to be chown'ed to
be owned by the user instead of root.
