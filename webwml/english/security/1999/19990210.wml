The wu-ftpd-academ and proftpd packages distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.0
(hamm) are vulnerable to a buffer overflow. It is possible to gain shell
access to the machine, and we recommend upgrading these packages immediately.

<p>Extract from the Netect report in CA-1999-03:<br>
Intruders who are able to exploit this vulnerability can ultimately gain
interactive access to the remote ftp server with root privilege.

<p>If you are using Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) you should download
a new version. Note that wu-ftpd
will install in a disabled state on some configurations; you can enable wu-ftpd
by uncommenting the line for /usr/sbin/ftpd in /etc/inetd.conf and running
<code>/etc/init.d/netbase reload</code>. The line for /usr/sbin/in.ftpd should
remain disabled.
