<define-tag moreinfo>The version of sendmail that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 has a slight problem in the code to regenerate the aliases
database. Sendmail allowed any user to run sendmail with the -bi option to
(re)initialize the aliases database. The user could then interrupt sendmail and
leave the system with a broken aliases database.                            

<p>This has been fixed by only allowing root and trusted users to regenerate
the aliases database.

<p>We recommend you upgrade your sendmail package to new version.
