<define-tag moreinfo>The version of amd that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 is vulnerable to a remote exploit. Passing a big directory name
to amd's logging code would overflow a buffer which could be exploited.  This
has been fixed in version 23.0slink1.

<p><em>Update:  </em>This fix caused an error that has been corrected in
version upl102-23.slink2.  Please refer to the <a href=19991018a>updated
DSA page for amd</a>, for information on correcting this problem.
