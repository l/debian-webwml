<define-tag moreinfo>The version of amd that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 is vulnerable to a remote exploit. Passing a big directory name
to amd's logging code would overflow a buffer which could be exploited.  This
has been fixed in version 23.0slink1.
<p>Note: This alert has been <a href=19991018a>updated,</a> please refer to the
