<define-tag moreinfo>The version of amd that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 is vulnerable to a remote exploit. Passing a big directory
name to amd's logging code would overflow a buffer which could be
exploited. That vulnerability was fixed in version 23.0slink1, see the
<a href="19990924">DSA page on 24 Sep 1999 for amd</a>.  However, that fix
contained an error which has been corrected in version upl102-23.slink2.
Use the information below to get corrected packages.
