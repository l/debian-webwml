<define-tag moreinfo>The version of lpr that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 suffers from a couple of problems:
<ul>
<li>there was a race in lpr that could be exploited by users to print files
they can not normally read
<li>lpd did not check permissions of queue-files. As a result by using the -s
flag it could be tricked into printing files a user can otherwise not read
</ul>
<p><b>Update</b>: Additional vulnerabilities have been discovered in lpr. See
<a href=../2000/20000109>http://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000109</a> for
more information.
