<define-tag moreinfo>The version of lpr that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 suffers from a couple of problems:
<ul>
<li>there was a race in lpr that could be exploited by users to print files
they cannot normally read
<li>lpd did not check permissions of queue-files. As a result by using the -s
flag it could be tricked into printing files a user can otherwise not read
</ul>

<p><b>Update</b>: Additional vulnerabilities have been discovered in lpr. See
<a href=../2000/20000109>https://www.debian.org/security/2000/20000109</a> for
more information, including the following:

<p>The version of lpr that was distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 and the
updated version released in 2.1r4 have two security problems:
<ul>
<li>the client hostname wasn't verified properly, so if someone is able to
control the DNS entry for their IP they could fool lpr into granting access.
<li>it was possible to specify extra options to sendmail which could be used
to specify another configuration file.  This can be used to gain root access.
</ul>
<p>Both problems have been fixed in 0.48-0.slink1.  We recommend you upgrade
your lpr package immediately.
