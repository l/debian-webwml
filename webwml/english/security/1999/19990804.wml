<define-tag moreinfo>The version of samba as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux
2.1 has a couple of security problems:
<ul>
<li>a Denial-of-Service attack against nmbd was possible
<li>it was possible to exploit smbd if you had a message command defined which
used the %f or %M formatter.
<li>smbmnt's check to see if a user is allowed to create a mount was flawed
which allowed users to mount at arbitrary mount points in the file system.
</ul>

<p>These problems have been fixed in version 2.0.5a-1. We recommend you upgrade
your samba packages immediately.

<p>Please note that this is a major upgrade so please be careful when you
upgrade since some changes to the configuration file might be necessary. The
configuration file also moved to a new location (/etc/samba).

<p>The smbfsx package is also obsolete with this update and has been replaced
by smbfs, which can handle both 2.0 and 2.2 kernels now.</define-tag>
