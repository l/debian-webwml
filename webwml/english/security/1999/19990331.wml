<define-tag moreinfo>Some versions of the X windowing system will make
<kbd>/tmp/.X11-unix</kbd> world readable, even if that location is a symbolic
link to
another file on the system. Debian 2.1 (slink) is <em>not</em> affected by this
problem.

<p>It appears that the bug was originally reported for a NetBSD system
on <a href="http://packetstorm.icx.fr/9903-exploits/X11R6.txt">Packetstorm - March 1999 exploits</a>,
the page has a reference showing that Linux is also vulnerable.  Additionally, 
SUSE Security Alert for this vulnerability is available on this
<a href="http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/1999/Mar/0216.html">BugTraq list - 1999 Mar (0216) page</a>.
