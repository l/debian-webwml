<define-tag moreinfo>We have become aware that the version mailman as supplied
in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 has a problem with verifying list administrators.
The problem is that the cookie value generation used was predictable, so
using forged authentication cookies it was possible to access the list
administration webpages without knowing the proper password.  More
information about this vulnerability can be found at
<fileurl http://mail.python.org/pipermail/mailman-developers/1999-June/001128.html>
This has been fixed in version 1.0rc2-5.</define-tag>
