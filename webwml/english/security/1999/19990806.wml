The current version of Debian is not vulnerable to this exploit. Those
using versions of Debian prior to 2.0 or cfingerd versions prior to 1.3.2-9
should upgrade to the latest version of cfingerd.

<p>The <a href="http://lists.insecure.org/lists/bugtraq/1999/Jul/0002.html">original bug report</a>, 
referred to in the "credit" section of BugTraq ID 512, has additional
information.

<p>An email in the <a href="http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/1999/07/msg00009.html">Stuttgart BugTraq archive 1999/07 (00009)</a> suggests 
using other variants of fingerd, instead of the patch referred to in the 
"solution" section of BugTraq ID 512.

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Another cfingerd exploit is covered in a later
advisory, available <a href="19990814">here</a>.
