A serious bug in cfingerd before version 1.4.0 has been
reported. It is present in all versions of cfingerd from 1.2.0 up to any
version of 1.3.2. If configured accordingly this bug enables any local user to
execute arbitrary programs with root privileges.

<p>You are safe if you have disabled ALLOW_EXECUTION in your cfingerd.conf file
in section "internal_config", i.e. that file contains a line "-ALLOW_EXECUTION"

<p>This is the default configuration of this package.  If you use the default
cfingerd.conf file as shipped with the distribution you are safe.  You should
still upgrade.

<p>All versions of cfingerd prior from 1.2.0 to 1.4.0 were vulnerable to this
exploit. The fix from 1.4.0 has been added to cfingerd 1.3.2-18.1 for slink,
which is available at the location below.

<p>N.B.: Fixed packages are available below for Debian 2.1 (slink). cfingerd
1.4.0 is included in Debian 2.2 (potato).
