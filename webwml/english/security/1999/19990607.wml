<define-tag moreinfo>Linux 2.2.x kernels had a problem with parsing IP
options, which made them susceptible to a DoS attack. The Debian GNU/Linux
2.1 release (slink) for the Sun sparc architecture uses such a kernel. If
you are using such a system and haven't upgraded the kernel yourself,
we recommend that you upgrade your kernel-image package immediately.
If you have a sun4u system please use kernel-image-2.2.9-sun4u, otherwise
use the normal kernel-image-2.2.9 package. Only the sparc architecture
uses a 2.2 kernel by default in the slink release.</define-tag>
