<define-tag moreinfo>The author of rsync, Andrew Tridgell, has reported that
former versions of rsync contained a security-related bug.  If you were
transferring an empty directory into a non-existent directory on a remote host,
permissions on the remote host may be mangled.  This bug may only happen in
very rare cases.  It's not likely that you have experienced this, but you'd
better check the permissions of your home directories.

<p>Andrew Tridgell's message is available at <a href="http://lwn.net/1999/0408/a/rsync.html">LWN - rsync (1999)</a> and
<a href="http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/archive/bugtraq/1999/04/msg00051.html">Stuttgart BUGTRAQ - 1999</a>.

<p>Here are some excerpts from Andrew's message to BUGTRAQ:
<p>... released rsync 2.3.1 to fix [the security hole].

<p>A user can't exploit this hole deliberately to gain privileges (ie. this
is not an "active" security hole) but a system administrator could ...
inadvertently compromise the security of their system.

<p>The fix is to chmod your home directory back to the correct permissions
 and upgrade to rsync 2.3.1. The bug is in the receiving side of rsync,
 so it is quite safe to continue to use older anonymous rsync servers as
 long as you upgrade your client.

<p>This bug has been present in all versions of rsync. I apologize for any
 inconvenience.
