<define-tag moreinfo>The author of rsync, Andrew Tridgell, has reported that
former versions of rsync contained a security-related bug.  If you were
transferring an empty directory into a non-existent directory on a remote host,
permissions on the remote host may be mangled.  This bug may only happen in
very rare cases.  It's not likely that you have experienced this, but you'd
better check the permissions of your home directories.</define-tag>
