<define-tag moreinfo>The version of wget in slink (2.1) and potato 
incorrectly attempts to chmod symlinks when invoked with the -N option.
The version in hamm (Debian 2.0) is not affected.

<p>Only the wget package in the unreleased Debian versions is affected. You can
install wget_1.4.5-0.1 from the Debian 2.0 release, or wait for a fixed
wget_1.5.3, which will be released shortly.
