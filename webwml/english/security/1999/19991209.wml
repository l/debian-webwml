<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of htdig that was shipped in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 has a problem
with calling external programs to handle non-HTML documents: it calls
the external program with the document as a parameter, but does not check
for shell escapes. This can be exploited by creating files with filenames
that include shell escapes to run arbitrary commands on the machine that
runs htdig.
