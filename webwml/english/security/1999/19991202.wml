<define-tag moreinfo>The version of dump that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 suffers from a problem with restoring symbolic links.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.4b9-0slink1. We recommend you upgrade your
dump package immediately.

<p>This version "Uses lchown instead of chown, fixing a possible security
problem when restoring symlinks (a malicious user could use this to
deliberately corrupt the ownership of important system files)".</define-tag>
