<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is prone to
a heap overflow vulnerability due to bad checking of the input data in
the curl_easy_unescape function.</p>

<p>The curl command line tool is not affected by this problem as it doesn't
use the curl_easy_unescape function.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.31.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
