<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found in icedtea-web, a
web browser plugin for running applets written in the Java programming
language. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an
attacker could cause the plugin to crash or possibly execute arbitrary
code as the user invoking the program.</p>

<p>This problem was initially discovered by Arthur Gerkis and got assigned
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4540">CVE-2012-4540</a>. Fixes where applied in the 1.1, 1.2 and 1.3 branches but
not to the 1.4 branch.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-3~deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedtea-web packages.</p>
