<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Lawrence Pit discovered that Ruby on Rails, a web development framenwork,
is vulnerable to a flaw in the parsing of JSON to YAML. Using a specially
crafted payload attackers can trick the backend into decoding a subset of
YAML.</p>

<p>The vulnerability has been addressed by removing the YAML backend and
adding the OkJson backend.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.14-6 of the ruby-activesupport-2.3 package.</p>

<p>The 3.2 version of rails as found in Debian wheezy and sid is not
affected by the problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
