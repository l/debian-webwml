<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Robert Matthews discovered that the Apache FCGID module, a FastCGI
implementation for Apache HTTP Server, fails to perform adequate
boundary checks on user-supplied input. This may allow a remote attacker
to cause a heap-based buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
or potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.6-1.2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.3.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-fcgid packages.</p>
