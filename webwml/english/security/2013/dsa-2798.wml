<define-tag description>unchecked ssl certificate host name</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Scott Cantor discovered that curl, a file retrieval tool, would disable
the CURLOPT_SSLVERIFYHOST check when the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER setting
was disabled.  This would also disable ssl certificate host name checks
when it should have only disabled verification of the certificate trust
chain.</p>

<p>The default configuration for the curl package is not affected by this
issue since CURLOPT_SSLVERIFYPEER is enabled by default.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy5.</p>

<p>For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem
has been fixed in version 7.33.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
