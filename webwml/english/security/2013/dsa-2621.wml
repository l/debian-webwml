<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0166">CVE-2013-0166</a>

    <p>OpenSSL does not properly perform signature verification for OCSP
    responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service via an invalid key.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0169">CVE-2013-0169</a>

    <p>A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
    analysis of crafted packages, known as the <q>Lucky Thirteen</q> issue.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8o-4squeeze14.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
