<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1918">CVE-2013-1918</a>

<p>
(<a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00000.html">XSA
45</a>) several long latency operations are not preemptible.
</p>

    <p>Some page table manipulation operations for PV guests were not made
    preemptible, allowing a malicious or buggy PV guest kernel to mount a
    denial of service attack affecting the whole system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1952">CVE-2013-1952</a>

<p>
(<a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-05/msg00001.html">XSA
49</a>) VT-d interrupt remapping source validation flaw for bridges.
</p>

    <p>Due to missing source validation on interrupt remapping table
    entries for MSI interrupts set up by bridge devices, a malicious
    domain with access to such a device can mount a denial of service
    attack affecting the whole system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964">CVE-2013-1964</a>

<p>
(<a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html">XSA
50</a>) grant table hypercall acquire/release imbalance.
</p>

    <p>When releasing a particular, non-transitive grant after doing a grant
    copy operation, Xen incorrectly releases an unrelated grant
    reference, leading possibly to a crash of the host system.
    Furthermore information leakage or privilege escalation cannot be
    ruled out.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.4-4.</p>

<p>Note that for the stable (wheezy), testing and unstable distribution,
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1964">CVE-2013-1964</a>
(<a href="http://lists.xen.org/archives/html/xen-announce/2013-04/msg00006.html">XSA
50</a>) was already fixed in version 4.1.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
