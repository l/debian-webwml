<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team discovered a bug in nginx,
a web server, which might allow an attacker to bypass security
restrictions by using a specially crafted request.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
