<p>It was discovered that in Mediawiki, a wiki engine, several API modules
allowed anti-CSRF tokens to be accessed via JSONP. These tokens protect
against cross site request forgeries and are confidential.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.5-2squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.19.5-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.19.8+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki packages.</p>
