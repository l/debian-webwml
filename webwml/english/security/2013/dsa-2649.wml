<define-tag description>fixed socket name in world-writable directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan BÃ¼hler discovered that the Debian specific configuration file for
lighttpd webserver FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the
world-writable /tmp directory. A symlink attack or a race condition could be
exploited by a malicious user on the same machine to take over the PHP control
socket and for example force the webserver to use a different PHP version.</p>

<p>As the fix is in a configuration file lying in /etc, the update won't be
enforced if the file has been modified by the administrator. In that case, care
should be taken to manually apply the fix.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.</p>
