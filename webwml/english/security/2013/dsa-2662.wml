<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1917">CVE-2013-1917</a>

    <p>The SYSENTER instruction can be used by PV guests to accelerate
    system call processing. This instruction, however, leaves the EFLAGS
    register mostly unmodified. This can be used by malicious or buggy
    user space to cause the entire host to crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1919">CVE-2013-1919</a>

    <p>Various IRQ related access control operations may not have the
    intended effect, potentially permitting a stub domain to grant its
    client domain access to an IRQ it doesn't have access to itself.
    This can be used by malicious or buggy stub domains kernels to mount
    a denial of service attack possibly affecting the whole system.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.1-5.9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
