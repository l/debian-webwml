<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that otrs2, the Open Ticket Request System, does not
properly sanitise user-supplied data that is used on SQL queries. An
attacker with a valid agent login could exploit this issue to craft SQL
queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code through manipulated URLs.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.9+dfsg1-3+squeeze4. This update also provides fixes for
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4751">CVE-2012-4751</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2625">CVE-2013-2625</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4088">CVE-2013-4088</a>, which were all fixed for
stable already.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.7+dfsg1-8+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.9-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.</p>
