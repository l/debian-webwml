<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in sudo, a program designed
to allow a sysadmin to give limited root privileges to users. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1775">CVE-2013-1775</a>

    <p>Marco Schoepl discovered an authentication bypass when the clock is
    set to the UNIX epoch [00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970].</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1776">CVE-2013-1776</a>

    <p>Ryan Castellucci and James Ogden discovered aspects of an issue that
    would allow session id hijacking from another authorized tty.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.4p4-2.squeeze.4.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
have been fixed in version 1.8.5p2-1+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo packages.</p>
