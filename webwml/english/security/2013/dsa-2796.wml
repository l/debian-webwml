<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matt Ezell from Oak Ridge National Labs reported a vulnerability in
torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.</p>

<p>A user could submit executable shell commands on the tail of what is
passed with the -M switch for qsub. This was later passed to a pipe,
making it possible for these commands to be executed as root on the
pbs_server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.</p>
