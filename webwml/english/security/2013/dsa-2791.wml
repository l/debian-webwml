<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Cedric Krier discovered that the Tryton client does not sanitize the
file extension supplied by the server when processing reports.  As a
result, a malicious server could send a report with a crafted file
extension that causes the client to write any local file to which the
user running the client has write access.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tryton-client packages.</p>
