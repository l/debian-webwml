<define-tag description>end-of-life announcement for iceape</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Security support for Iceape, the Debian-branded version of the Seamonkey
suite needed to be stopped before the end of the regular security maintenance 
life cycle.</p>

<p>We recommend to migrate to Iceweasel for the web browser functionality and 
to Icedove for the e-mail bits. Iceweasel and Icedove are based on the same 
codebase and will continue to be supported with security updates. Alternatively 
you can switch to the binaries provided by Mozilla available at
