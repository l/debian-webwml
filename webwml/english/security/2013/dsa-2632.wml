<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0231">CVE-2013-0231</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich provided a fix for an issue in the Xen PCI backend drivers.
    Users of guests on a system using passed-through PCI devices can create
    a denial of service of the host system due to the use of non-ratelimited
    kernel log messages.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0871">CVE-2013-0871</a>

    <p>Suleiman Souhlal and Salman Qazi of Google, with help from Aaron Durbin
    and Michael Davidson of Google, discovered an issue in the
    ptrace subsystem. Due to a race condition with PTRACE_SETREGS, local users
    can cause kernel stack corruption and execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.32-48squeeze1.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">

      <th>Debian 6.0 (squeeze)</th>

      <td>user-mode-linux</td>
      <td>2.6.32-1um-4+48squeeze1</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.</p>
