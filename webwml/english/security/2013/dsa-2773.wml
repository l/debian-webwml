<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU privacy guard,
a free PGP replacement. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4351">CVE-2013-4351</a>

   <p>When a key or subkey had its <q>key flags</q> subpacket set to all bits
   off, GnuPG currently would treat the key as having all bits set.
   That is, where the owner wanted to indicate <q>no use permitted</q>,
   GnuPG would interpret it as <q>all use permitted</q>. Such <q>no use
   permitted</q> keys are rare and only used in very special circumstances.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4402">CVE-2013-4402</a>

    <p>Infinite recursion in the compressed packet parser was possible
    with crafted input data, which may be used to cause a denial of
    service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
