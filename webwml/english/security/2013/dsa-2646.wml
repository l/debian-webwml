<p>TYPO3, a PHP-based content management system, was found vulnerable to several vulnerabilities.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1842">CVE-2013-1842</a>

    <p>Helmut Hummel and Markus Opahle discovered that the Extbase database layer
    was not correctly sanitizing user input when using the Query object model.
    This can lead to SQL injection by a malicious user inputing crafted
    relation values.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1843">CVE-2013-1843</a>

    <p>Missing user input validation in the access tracking mechanism could lead
    to arbitrary URL redirection.
</p><p>
    Note: the fix will break already published links. Upstream advisory
    <a href="http://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-core-sa-2013-001/">TYPO3-CORE-SA-2013-001</a>
    has more information on how to mitigate that.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.9+dfsg1-1+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.19+dfsg1-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.19+dfsg1-5.</p>
