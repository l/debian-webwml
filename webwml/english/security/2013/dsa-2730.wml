<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yarom and Falkner discovered that RSA secret keys could be leaked via
a side channel attack, where a malicious local user could obtain private
key information from another user on the system.</p>

<p>This update fixes this issue for the 1.4 series of GnuPG. GnuPG 2.x is
affected through its use of the libgcrypt11 library, a fix for which
will be published in DSA 2731.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
