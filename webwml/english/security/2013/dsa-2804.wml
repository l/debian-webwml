<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured 
content management framework: Cross-site request forgery, insecure
pseudo random number generation, code execution, incorrect security token
validation and cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the remote code execution vulnerability, it is 
recommended to create a .htaccess file (or an equivalent configuration 
directive in case you are not using Apache to serve your Drupal sites) 
in each of your sites' <q>files</q> directories (both public and private, in 
case you have both configured).</p>

<p>Please refer to the NEWS file provided with this update and the upstream
advisory at <a href="https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003">\
drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003</a> for further information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.14-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.24-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal7 packages.</p>
