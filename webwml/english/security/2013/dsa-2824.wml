<p>Marc Deslauriers discovered that curl, a file retrieval tool, would
mistakenly skip verifying the CN and SAN name fields when digital
signature verification was disabled in the libcurl GnuTLS backend.</p>

<p>The default configuration for the curl package is not affected by this
issue since the digital signature verification is enabled by default.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.34.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
