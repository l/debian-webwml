<p>It was discovered that PyOpenSSL, a Python wrapper around the OpenSSL
library, does not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in
the Subject Alternative Name field.</p>

<p>A remote attacker in the position to obtain a certificate for
'www.foo.org\0.example.com' from a CA that a SSL client trusts, could
use this to spoof <q>www.foo.org</q> and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks
between the PyOpenSSL-using client and the SSL server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pyopenssl packages.</p>
