<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Malcolm Scott discovered a remote-exploitable buffer overflow in the
RFC1413 (ident) client of cfingerd, a configurable finger daemon. This
vulnerability was introduced in a previously applied patch to the
cfingerd package in 1.4.3-3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-3+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-3.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cfingerd packages.</p>
