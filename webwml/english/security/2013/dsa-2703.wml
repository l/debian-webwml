<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Subversion, a version control
system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1968">CVE-2013-1968</a>

    <p>Subversion repositories with the FSFS repository data store format
    can be corrupted by newline characters in filenames. A remote
    attacker with a malicious client could use this flaw to disrupt the
    service for other users using that repository.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2112">CVE-2013-2112</a>

    <p>Subversion's svnserve server process may exit when an incoming TCP
    connection is closed early in the connection process. A remote
    attacker can cause svnserve to exit and thus deny service to users
    of the server.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.12dfsg-7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
