<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in FFmpeg, a multimedia
player, server and encoder. Multiple input validations in the
decoders/demuxers for Shorten, Chines AVS video, VP5, VP6, AVI, AVS and
MPEG-1/2 files could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Most of these issues were discovered by Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael
Coldwind.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:0.5.10-1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 6:0.8.5-1 of the source package
libav.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg packages.</p>
