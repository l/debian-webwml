<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Davfs2, a filesystem client for WebDAV, calls the function system()
insecurely while is setuid root. This might allow a privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1.1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.7-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.7-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your davfs2 packages.</p>
