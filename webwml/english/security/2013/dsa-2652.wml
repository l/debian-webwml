<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Brad Hill of iSEC Partners discovered that many XML implementations are
vulnerable to external entity expansion issues, which can be used for
various purposes such as firewall circumvention, disguising an IP
address, and denial-of-service.  libxml2 was susceptible to these
problems when performing string substitution during entity expansion.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distributions, these problems
have been fixed in version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.</p>
