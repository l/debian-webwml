<define-tag description>insufficient input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Rails, the Ruby web application development
framework, performed insufficient validation on input parameters,
allowing unintended type conversions. An attacker may use this to
bypass authentication systems, inject arbitrary SQL, inject and
execute arbitrary code, or perform a DoS attack on the application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze4.1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
