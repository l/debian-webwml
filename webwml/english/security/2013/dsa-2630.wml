<p>Sumit Soni discovered that PostgreSQL, an object-relational SQL database,
could be forced to crash when an internal function was called with
invalid arguments, resulting in denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.16-0squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.16-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8.4.16-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-8.4 packages.</p>
