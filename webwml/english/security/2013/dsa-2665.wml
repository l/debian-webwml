<define-tag description>authentication bypass</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kevin Wojtysiak discovered a vulnerability in strongSwan, an IPsec
based VPN solution.</p>

<p>When using the OpenSSL plugin for ECDSA based authentication, an empty,
zeroed or otherwise invalid signature is handled as a legitimate one.
An attacker could use a forged signature to authenticate like a legitimate
user and gain access to the VPN (and everything protected by this).</p>

<p>While the issue looks like <a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2388">CVE-2012-2388</a>
(RSA signature based authentication bypass), it is unrelated.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6.4-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
