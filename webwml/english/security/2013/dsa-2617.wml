<p>Jann Horn had reported two vulnerabilities in Samba, a popular
cross-platform network file and printer sharing suite. In particular,
these vulnerabilities affect to SWAT, the Samba Web Administration Tool.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0213">CVE-2013-0213</a>:
Clickjacking issue in SWAT
<p>
    An attacker can integrate a SWAT page into a malicious web page via a
    frame or iframe and then overlaid by other content. If an
    authenticated valid user interacts with this malicious web page, she
    might perform unintended changes in the Samba settings.</p></li>

<li>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0214">CVE-2013-0214</a>:
Potential Cross-site request forgery
<p>
    An attacker can persuade a valid SWAT user, who is logged in, to
    click in a malicious link and trigger arbitrary unintended changes in
    the Samba settings.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
