<p>Insufficient input sanitization in Ganglia, a web based monitoring system,
could lead to remote PHP script execution with permissions of the user running
the web browser.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.7-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ganglia packages.</p>
