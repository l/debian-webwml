<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Krzysztof Katowicz-Kowalewski discovered a vulnerability in Fail2ban, a
log monitoring and system which can act on attack by preventing hosts to
connect to specified services using the local firewall.</p>

<p>When using Fail2ban to monitor Apache logs, improper input validation in
log parsing could enable a remote attacker to trigger an IP ban on
arbitrary addresses, thus causing a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.4-3+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.6-3wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fail2ban packages.</p>
