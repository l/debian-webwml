<p>Yury Dyachenko discovered that Zend Framework uses the PHP XML parser
in an insecure way, allowing attackers to open files and trigger HTTP
requests, potentially accessing restricted information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.6-1squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.13-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.13-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.</p>
