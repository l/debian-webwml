<define-tag description>cross-site scripting vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nick Brunn reported a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in
python-django, a high-level Python web development framework.</p>

<p>The is_safe_url utility function used to validate that a used URL is on
the current host to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from
maliciously-constructed querystrings, worked as intended for HTTP and
HTTPS URLs, but permitted redirects to other schemes, such as
javascript:.</p>

<p>The is_safe_url function has been modified to properly recognize and
reject URLs which specify a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS, to prevent
cross-site scripting attacks through redirecting to other schemes.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.5.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
