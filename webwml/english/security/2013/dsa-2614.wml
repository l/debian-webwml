<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple stack-based buffer overflows were discovered in libupnp, a library
used for handling the Universal Plug and Play protocol. HD Moore from Rapid7
discovered that SSDP queries where not correctly handled by the
unique_service_name() function.</p>

<p>An attacker sending carefully crafted SSDP queries to a daemon built on libupnp
could generate a buffer overflow, overwriting the stack, leading to the daemon
crash and possible remote code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.6-5+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.17-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libupnp packages.</p>
