<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Ruby on Rails, a Ruby framework
for web application development.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0276">CVE-2013-0276</a>

	<p>The blacklist provided by the attr_protected method could be
	bypassed with crafted requests, having an application-specific
	impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0277">CVE-2013-0277</a>

	<p>In some applications, the +serialize+ helper in ActiveRecord
	could be tricked into deserializing arbitrary YAML data,
	possibly leading to remote code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
