<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yarom and Falkner discovered that RSA secret keys in applications using
the libgcrypt11 library, for example GnuPG 2.x, could be leaked via
a side channel attack, where a malicious local user could obtain private
key information from another user on the system.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-2+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.0-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.5.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.</p>
