<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJPEG, a JPEG 2000
image library, that may lead to denial of service (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1447">CVE-2013-1447</a>) via
application crash or high memory consumption, possible code execution
through heap buffer overflows (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6045">CVE-2013-6045</a>), information disclosure
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6052">CVE-2013-6052</a>), or yet another heap buffer overflow that only appears
to affect OpenJPEG 1.3 (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6054">CVE-2013-6054</a>).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+dfsg-4.7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjpeg packages.</p>
