<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that roundcube, a skinnable AJAX based webmail
solution for IMAP servers, does not properly sanitize the _session
parameter in steps/utils/save_pref.inc during saving preferences. The
vulnerability can be exploited to overwrite configuration settings and
subsequently allowing random file access, manipulated SQL queries and
even code execution.</p>

<p>roundcube in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.2-9+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.</p>
