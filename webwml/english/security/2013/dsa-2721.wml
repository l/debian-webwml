<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been identified in nginx, a small, powerful,
scalable web/proxy server, when processing certain chunked transfer
encoding requests if proxy_pass to untrusted upstream HTTP servers is
used.  An attacker may use this flaw to perform denial of service
attacks, disclose worker process memory, or possibly execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2.2+wheezy1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
