<define-tag description>mis-issued intermediates</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Google, Inc. discovered that the TurkTrust certification authority
included in the Network Security Service libraries (nss) mis-issued
two intermediate CAs which could be used to generate rogue end-entity
certificates. This update explicitly distrusts those two intermediate
CAs. The two existing TurkTrust root CAs remain active.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.13.6-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.1.with.ckbi.1.93-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
