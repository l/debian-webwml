<define-tag description>symlink race</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that in ProFTPd, an FTP server, an attacker on
the same physical host as the server may be able to perform a symlink
attack allowing to elevate privileges in some configurations.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.4a-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.</p>
