<p>It was discovered that exactimage, a fast image processing library,
does not correctly handle error conditions of the embedded copy of
dcraw. This could result in a crash or other behaviour in an
application using the library due to an uninitialized variable being
passed to longjmp.</p>

<p>This is a different issue than <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1438">CVE-2013-1438</a>/DSA-2748-1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3+deb6u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.5-5+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.8.9-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exactimage packages.</p>
