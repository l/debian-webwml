<p>Nicolas Gregoire discovered that libxslt, an XSLT processing runtime
library, is prone to denial of service vulnerabilities via crafted XSL
stylesheets.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.26-6+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.26-14.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.26-14.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxslt packages.</p>
