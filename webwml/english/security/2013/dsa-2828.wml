<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Drupal, a fully-featured
content management framework: vulnerabilities due to optimistic cross-site
request forgery protection, insecure pseudo random number generation, code
execution and incorrect security token validation.</p>

<p>In order to avoid the remote code execution vulnerability, it is
recommended to create a .htaccess file (or an equivalent configuration
directive in case you are not using Apache to serve your Drupal sites)
in each of your sites' <q>files</q> directories (both public and private, in
case you have both configured).</p>

<p>Please refer to the NEWS file provided with this update and the upstream
advisory at https://drupal.org/SA-CORE-2013-003 for further information.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.29-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 packages.</p>
