<define-tag description>Denial of service and authorization bypass</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been found in the ASN.1 parser of strongSwan, an IKE
daemon used to establish IPsec protected links.</p>

<p>By sending a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID payload to a vulnerable pluto or
charon daemon, a malicious remote user can provoke a denial of service
(daemon crash) or an authorization bypass (impersonating a different
user, potentially acquiring VPN permissions she doesn't have).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-5.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
