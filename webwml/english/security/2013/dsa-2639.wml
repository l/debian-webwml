<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, the web scripting
language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1635">CVE-2013-1635</a>

    <p>If a PHP application accepted untrusted SOAP object input remotely
    from clients, an attacker could read system files readable for the
    webserver.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1643">CVE-2013-1643</a>

    <p>The soap.wsdl_cache_dir function did not take PHP open_basedir
    restrictions into account. Note that Debian advises against relying
    on open_basedir restrictions for security.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze15.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.4-14.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
