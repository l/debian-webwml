<define-tag description>rehashing flaw</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yves Orton discovered a flaw in the rehashing code of Perl. This flaw
could be exploited to carry out a denial of service attack against code
that uses arbitrary user input as hash keys. Specifically an attacker
could create a set of keys of a hash causing a denial of service via
memory exhaustion.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.10.1-17squeeze6.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 5.14.2-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
