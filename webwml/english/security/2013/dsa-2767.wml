<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kingcope discovered that the mod_sftp and mod_sftp_pam modules of
proftpd, a powerful modular FTP/SFTP/FTPS server, are not properly
validating input, before making pool allocations. An attacker can
use this flaw to conduct denial of service attacks against the system
running proftpd (resource exhaustion).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3a-6squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.4a-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem will
be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.</p>
