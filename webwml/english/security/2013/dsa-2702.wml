<define-tag description>TLS verification bypass</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Maksim Otstavnov discovered that the Wocky submodule used by
telepathy-gabble, the Jabber/XMPP connection manager for the Telepathy
framework, does not respect the tls-required flag on legacy Jabber
servers. A network intermediary could use this vulnerability to bypass
TLS verification and perform a man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15-1+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.16.5-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.16.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your telepathy-gabble packages.</p>
