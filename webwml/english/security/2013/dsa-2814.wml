<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A denial of service vulnerability was reported in varnish, a state of
the art, high-performance web accelerator. With some configurations of
varnish a remote attacker could mount a denial of service (child-process
crash and temporary caching outage) via a GET request with trailing
whitespace characters and no URI.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.3-8+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your varnish packages.</p>
