<p>It was discovered that the kpasswd service running on UDP port 464
could respond to response packets, creating a packet loop and a denial
of service condition.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
