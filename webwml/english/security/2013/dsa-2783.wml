<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Rack, a modular Ruby
webserver interface. The Common Vulnerabilites and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5036">CVE-2011-5036</a>

    <p>Rack computes hash values for form parameters without restricting
    the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption)
    by sending many crafted parameters.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0184">CVE-2013-0184</a>

    <p>A vulnerability in Rack::Auth::AbstractRequest allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service via unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0263">CVE-2013-0263</a>

    <p>Rack::Session::Cookie allows remote attackers to guess the
    session cookie, gain privileges, and execute arbitrary code via a
    timing attack involving an HMAC comparison function that does not
    run in constant time.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.0-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain the
librack-ruby package. They have already been addressed in version
1.4.1-2.1 of the ruby-rack package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your librack-ruby packages.</p>
