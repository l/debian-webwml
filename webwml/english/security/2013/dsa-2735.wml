<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version 
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: multiple memory safety errors, 
missing permission checks and other implementation errors may lead to 
the execution of arbitrary code, cross-site scripting, privilege 
escalation, bypass of the same-origin policy or the installation of 
malicious addons.</p>

<p>The Iceweasel version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no 
longer supported with security updates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
