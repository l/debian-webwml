<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that puppet, a centralized configuration management
system, did not correctly handle YAML payloads. A remote attacker could
use a specially-crafted payload to execute arbitrary code on the puppet
master.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.18-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your puppet packages.</p>
