<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of 
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client. Multiple memory safety 
errors, missing permission checks and other implementation errors may 
lead to the execution of arbitrary code or cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>The Icedove version in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) is no longer 
supported with full security updates. However, it should be noted that 
almost all security issues in Icedove stem from the included browser engine.
These security problems only affect Icedove if scripting and HTML mails 
are enabled. If there are security issues specific to Icedove (e.g. a 
hypothetical buffer overflow in the IMAP implementation) we'll make an 
effort to backport such fixes to oldstable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 17.0.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
