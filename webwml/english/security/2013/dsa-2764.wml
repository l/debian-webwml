<p>Daniel P. Berrange discovered that incorrect memory handling in the
remoteDispatchDomainMemoryStats() function could lead to denial of
service.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11+deb7u4. This update also includes some non-security
related bugfixes scheduled for the upcoming Wheezy 7.2 point release.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.</p>
