<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

    <p>Creating DateInterval objects from parsed ISO dates was
    not properly restricted, which allowed to cause a
    denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, the update for Debian 7 <q>Wheezy</q> contains several bugfixes
originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.3.3-7+squeeze18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
