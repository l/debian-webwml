<p>Several vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting
language commonly used for web application development. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

    <p>Creating DateInterval objects from parsed ISO dates was

</ul>

<p>In addition, the update for Debian 7 <q>Wheezy</q> contains several bugfixes
originally targeted for the upcoming Wheezy point release.</p>
