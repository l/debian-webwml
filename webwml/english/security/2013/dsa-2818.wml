<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered in the MySQL database server. The
vulnerabilities are addressed by upgrading MySQL to a new upstream
version, 5.5.33, which includes additional changes, such as performance
improvements, bug fixes, new features, and possibly incompatible
changes. Please see the MySQL 5.5 Release Notes for further details:</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition this update fixes two issues affecting specifically the
mysql-5.5 Debian package:</p>

<p>A race condition in the post-installation script of the mysql-server-5.5
package creates the configuration file <q>/etc/mysql/debian.cnf</q> with
world-readable permissions before restricting the permissions, which
allows local users to read the file and obtain sensitive information
such as credentials for the debian-sys-maint to perform
administration tasks. 
(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2162">\
CVE-2013-2162</a>)</p>

<p>Matthias Reichl reported that the mysql-5.5 package misses the patches
applied previous in Debian's mysql-5.1 to drop the database <q>test</q> and
the permissions that allow anonymous access, without a password, from
localhost to the <q>test</q> database and any databases starting with
<q>test_</q>. This update reintroduces these patches for the mysql-5.5
package.</p>

<p>Existing databases and permissions are not touched. Please refer to the
NEWS file provided with this update for further information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5.33+dfsg-0+wheezy1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), the Debian specific problems will
be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-5.5 packages.</p>
