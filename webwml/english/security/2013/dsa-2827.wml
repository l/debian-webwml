<define-tag description>arbitrary file upload via deserialization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Apache Commons FileUpload, a package to make it
easy to add robust, high-performance, file upload capability to servlets
and web applications, incorrectly handled file names with NULL bytes in
serialized instances. A remote attacker able to supply a serialized
instance of the DiskFileItem class, which will be deserialized on a
server, could use this flaw to write arbitrary content to any location
on the server that is accessible to the user running the application
server process.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-fileupload-java packages.</p>
