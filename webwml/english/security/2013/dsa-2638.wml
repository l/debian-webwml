<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in OpenAFS, the implementation
of the distributed filesystem AFS, which might result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code. Further information is
available at
<a href="http://www.openafs.org/security">http://www.openafs.org/security</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.12.1+dfsg-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.</p>
