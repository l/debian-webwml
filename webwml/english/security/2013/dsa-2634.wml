<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Django, a high-level
Python web development framework.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4520">CVE-2012-4520</a>

    <p>James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the HTTP
    Host header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit
    this to generate and cause parts of Django, particularly the
    password-reset mechanism, to display arbitrary URLs to users.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0305">CVE-2013-0305</a>

    <p>Orange Tsai discovered that the bundled administrative interface
    of Django could expose supposedly-hidden information via its history
    log.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0306">CVE-2013-0306</a>

    <p>Mozilla discovered that an attacker can abuse Django's tracking of
    the number of forms in a formset to cause a denial-of-service attack
    due to extreme memory consumption.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1665">CVE-2013-1665</a>

    <p>Michael Koziarski discovered that Django's XML deserialization is
    vulnerable to entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
