<p>David Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,
the X.Org X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw
related to input handling and devices hotplug.</p>

<p>When an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT
switch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and
handled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to
its clients on the background.</p>

<p>This could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended
for the X clients, including sensitive information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.7.7-16.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.</p>
