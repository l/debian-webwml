<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter McLarnan discovered that the internationalization component of
Ruby on Rails does not properly encode parameters in generated HTML
code, resulting in a cross-site scripting vulnerability.  This update
corrects the underlying vulnerability in the i18n gem, as provided by
the ruby-i18n package.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem;
the libi18n-ruby package does not contain the vulnerable code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.0-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-i18n packages.</p>
