<p>Alexandru Cornea discovered a vulnerability in libdbus caused by an
implementation bug in _dbus_printf_string_upper_bound(). This
vulnerability can be exploited by a local user to crash system services
that use libdbus, causing denial of service. Depending on the dbus
services running, it could lead to complete system crash.</p>
