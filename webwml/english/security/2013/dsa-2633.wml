<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Helmut Grohne discovered multiple privilege escalation flaws in FusionForge, a
web-based project-management and collaboration software. Most of the
vulnerabilities are related to the bad handling of privileged operations on
user-controlled files or directories.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.2-5+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the testing (wheezy) and unstable (sid) distribution, these problems will
be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fusionforge packages.</p>
