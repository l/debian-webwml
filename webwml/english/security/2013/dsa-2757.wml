<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were identified in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and specific
fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to upgrade the
Wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of backporting
the patches.</p>

<p>This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4338">CVE-2013-4338</a>

    <p>Unsafe PHP unserialization in wp-includes/functions.php could cause
    arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4339">CVE-2013-4339</a>

    <p>Insufficient input validation could result in redirecting or leading
    a user to another website.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4340">CVE-2013-4340</a>

    <p>Privilege escalation allowing an user with an author role to create
    an entry appearing as written by another user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5738">CVE-2013-5738</a>

    <p>Insufficient capabilities were required for uploading .html/.html
    files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
    scripting attacks (XSS) using crafted html file uploads.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5739">CVE-2013-5739</a>

    <p>Default Wordpress configuration allowed file upload for .swf/.exe
    files, making it easier for authenticated users to conduct cross-site
    scripting attacks (XSS).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
