<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for
network daemons, is prone to a buffer overflow vulnerability when using
the Microsoft NT LAN Manager (NTLM) authentication
(<q>protocolAuthentication = NTLM</q>) together with the <q>connect</q>
protocol method (<q>protocol = connect</q>). With these prerequisites
and using stunnel4 in SSL client mode (<q>client = yes</q>) on a 64 bit
host, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the stunnel process, if the attacker can either control
the specified proxy server or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on the
tcp session between stunnel and the proxy sever.</p>

<p>Note that for the testing distribution (wheezy) and the unstable
distribution (sid), stunnel4 is compiled with stack smashing protection
enabled, which should help protect against arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.29-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:4.53-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.</p>
