<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Asterisk, a PBX and telephony
toolkit, that allow remote attackers to perform denial of service
attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.6.2.9-2+squeeze9.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
