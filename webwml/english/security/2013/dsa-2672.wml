<p>Adam Nowacki discovered that the new FreeBSD NFS implementation
processes a crafted READDIR request which instructs to operate a file
system on a file node as if it were a directory node, leading to a
kernel crash or potentially arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>The kfreebsd-8 kernel in the oldstable distribution (squeeze) does not
enable the new NFS implementation.  The Linux kernel is not affected
by this vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 9.0-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.</p>
