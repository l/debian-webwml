browser.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2855">CVE-2013-2855</a>

    <p>The Developer Tools API in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or
    possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2856">CVE-2013-2856</a>

    <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    input.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2857">CVE-2013-2857</a>

    <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors related to the handling of
    images.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2858">CVE-2013-2858</a>

    <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in the HTML5 Audio implementation in
    Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
    unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2859">CVE-2013-2859</a>

    <p>Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to bypass
    the Same Origin Policy and trigger namespace pollution via
    unspecified vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2860">CVE-2013-2860</a>

    <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110
    allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly
    have unspecified other impact via vectors involving access to a
    database API by a worker process.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2861">CVE-2013-2861</a>

    <p>Use-after-free vulnerability in the SVG implementation in Chromium
    before 27.0.1453.110 allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via
    unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2862">CVE-2013-2862</a>

    <p>Skia, as used in Chromium before 27.0.1453.110, does not
    properly handle GPU acceleration, which allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have
    unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2863">CVE-2013-2863</a>

    <p>Chromium before 27.0.1453.110 does not properly handle SSL
    sockets, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or
    cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via unspecified
    vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2865">CVE-2013-2865</a>

    <p>Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Chromium before
    27.0.1453.110 allow attackers to cause a denial of service or
    possibly have other impact via unknown vectors.</p></li>
