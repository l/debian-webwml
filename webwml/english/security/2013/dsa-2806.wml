<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that nbd-server, the server for the Network Block
Device protocol, did incorrect parsing of the access control lists,
allowing access to any hosts with an IP address sharing a prefix with
an allowed address.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.9.16-8+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.2-4~deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nbd packages.</p>
