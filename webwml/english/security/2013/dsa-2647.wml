<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow was discovered in the Firebird database server, which
could result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.3.18185-0.ds1-11+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), firebird2.1 will be removed in
favour of firebird2.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), firebird2.1 will be removed in
favour of firebird2.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2.1 packages.</p>
