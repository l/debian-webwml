<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aki Helin of OUSPG discovered many out-of-bounds read issues in libxml2,
the GNOME project's XML parser library, which can lead to denial of
service issues when handling XML documents that end abruptly. </p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.8.dfsg-2+squeeze8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0+dfsg1-7+nmu2.</p>

<p>For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions (jessie), this
problem has been fixed in version 2.9.1+dfsg1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.</p>
