<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An unsafe use of temporary files was discovered in Puppet, a tool for

vulnerability and overwrite an arbitrary file in the system.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-5+squeeze9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.23-1~deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
