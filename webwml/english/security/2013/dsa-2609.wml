<define-tag description>SQL query manipulation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An interpretation conflict can cause the Active Record component of
Rails, a web framework for the Ruby programming language, to truncate
queries in unexpected ways.  This may allow attackers to elevate their
privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.5-1.2+squeeze5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
