<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that NSPR, Netscape Portable Runtime library, could
crash an application using the library when parsing a certificate that
causes an integer overflow. This flaw only affects 64-bit systems.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8.6-1+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:4.9.2-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2:4.10.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nspr packages.</p>
