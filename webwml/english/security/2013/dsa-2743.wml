<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation or information leak. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3077">CVE-2013-3077</a>

    <p>Clement Lecigne from the Google Security Team reported an integer
    overflow in computing the size of a temporary buffer in the IP
    multicast code, which can result in a buffer which is too small
    for the requested operation. An unprivileged process can read or
    write pages of memory which belong to the kernel. These may lead
    to exposure of sensitive information or allow privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4851">CVE-2013-4851</a>

    <p>Rick Macklem, Christopher Key and Tim Zingelman reported that the
    FreeBSD kernel incorrectly uses client supplied credentials
    instead of the one configured in exports(5) when filling out the
    anonymous credential for a NFS export, when -network or -host
    restrictions are used at the same time.  The remote client may
    supply privileged credentials (e.g. the root user) when accessing
    a file under the NFS share, which will bypass the normal access
    checks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5209">CVE-2013-5209</a>

    <p>Julian Seward and Michael Tuexen reported a kernel memory
    disclosure when initializing the SCTP state cookie being sent in
    INIT-ACK chunks, a buffer allocated from the kernel stack is not
    completely initialized.  Fragments of kernel memory may be
    included in SCTP packets and transmitted over the network. For
    each SCTP session, there are two separate instances in which a
    4-byte fragment may be transmitted.</p>

    <p>This memory might contain sensitive information, such as portions
    of the file cache or terminal buffers.  This information might be
    directly useful, or it might be leveraged to obtain elevated
    privileges in some way. For example, a terminal buffer might
    include an user-entered password.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems has been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.</p>
