<define-tag description>files and device nodes ownership change to kvm group</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bastian Blank discovered that libvirtd, a daemon for management of virtual
machines, network and storage, would change ownership of devices files so they
would be owned by user <q>libvirt-qemu</q> and group <q>kvm</q>, which is a general
purpose group not specific to libvirt, allowing unintended write access to
those devices and files for the kvm group members.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.3-5+squeeze5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.12-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvirt packages.</p>
