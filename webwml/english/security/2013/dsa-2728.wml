<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Maxim Shudrak and the HP Zero Day Initiative reported a denial of
service vulnerability in BIND, a DNS server. A specially crafted query
that includes malformed rdata can cause named daemon to terminate with
an assertion failure while rejecting the malformed query.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
