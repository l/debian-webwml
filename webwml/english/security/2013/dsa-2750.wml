<p>Anton Kortunov reported a heap corruption in ImageMagick, a program
collection and library for converting and manipulating image files.
Crafted GIF files could cause ImageMagick to crash, potentially
leading to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 8:6.7.7.10-5+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 8:6.7.7.10-6.</p>
