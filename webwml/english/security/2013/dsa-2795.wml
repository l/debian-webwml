<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the lighttpd web server.</p>

<p>It was discovered that SSL connections with client certificates
stopped working after the DSA-2795-1 update of lighttpd.  An upstream
patch has now been applied that provides an appropriate identifier for
client certificate verification.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4508">CVE-2013-4508</a>

    <p>It was discovered that lighttpd uses weak ssl ciphers when SNI (Server
    Name Indication) is enabled.  This issue was solved by ensuring that
    stronger ssl ciphers are used when SNI is selected.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4559">CVE-2013-4559</a>

    <p>The clang static analyzer was used to discover privilege escalation
    issues due to missing checks around lighttpd's setuid, setgid, and
    setgroups calls.  Those are now appropriately checked.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4560">CVE-2013-4560</a>

    <p>The clang static analyzer was used to discover a use-after-free issue
    when the FAM stat cache engine is enabled, which is now fixed.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.28-2+squeeze1.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.31-4+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions, the regression 
problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lighttpd packages.</p>
