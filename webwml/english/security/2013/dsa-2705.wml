<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jibbers McGee discovered that PyMongo, a high-performance schema-free
document-oriented data store, is prone to a denial-of-service
vulnerability.</p>

<p>An attacker can remotely trigger a NULL pointer dereference causing MongoDB
to crash.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pymongo packages.</p>
