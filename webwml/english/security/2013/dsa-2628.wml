<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Garth Mollett discovered that a file descriptor overflow issue in the
use of FD_SET() in nss-pam-ldapd, which provides NSS and PAM modules for
using LDAP as a naming service, can lead to a stack-based buffer
overflow. An attacker could, under some circumstances, use this flaw to
cause a process that has the NSS or PAM module loaded to crash or
potentially execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.15+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.10-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss-pam-ldapd packages.</p>
