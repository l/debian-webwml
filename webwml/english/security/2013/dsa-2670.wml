<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3368">CVE-2013-3368</a>

    <p>The rt command line tool uses semi-predictable temporary files. A
    malicious user can use this flaw to overwrite files with permissions
    of the user running the rt command line tool.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3369">CVE-2013-3369</a>

    <p>A malicious user who is allowed to see administration pages can run
    arbitrary Mason components (without control of arguments), which may
    have negative side-effects.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3370">CVE-2013-3370</a>

    <p>Request Tracker allows direct requests to private callback
    components, which could be used to exploit a Request Tracker
    extension or a local callback which uses the arguments passed to it
    insecurely.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3371">CVE-2013-3371</a>

    <p>Request Tracker is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks via
    attachment filenames.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3372">CVE-2013-3372</a>

    <p>Dominic Hargreaves discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to
    an HTTP header injection limited to the value of the
    Content-Disposition header.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3373">CVE-2013-3373</a>

    <p>Request Tracker is vulnerable to a MIME header injection in outgoing
    email generated by Request Tracker.</p>

    <p>Request Tracker stock templates are resolved by this update. But any
    custom email templates should be updated to ensure that values
    interpolated into mail headers do not contain newlines.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-3374">CVE-2013-3374</a>

    <p>Request Tracker is vulnerable to limited session re-use when using
    the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File. However Request
    Tracker's default session configuration only uses
    Apache::Session::File when configured for Oracle databases.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This version of Request Tracker includes a database content upgrade. If
you are using a dbconfig-managed database, you will be offered the
choice of applying this automatically. Otherwise see the explanation in
/usr/share/doc/request-tracker3.8/NEWS.Debian.gz for the manual steps to
perform.</p>

<p>Please note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web
server, you must stop and start Apache manually. The <q>restart</q> mechanism
is not recommended, especially when using mod_perl or any form of
persistent Perl process such as FastCGI or SpeedyCGI.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.8-7+squeeze7.</p>

<p>The stable, testing and unstable distributions do not contain anymore
request-tracker3.8, which is replaced by request-tracker4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.</p>
