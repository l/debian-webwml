<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PolarSSL. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0169">CVE-2013-0169</a>

    <p>A timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding
    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical
    analysis of crafted packages, known as the <q>Lucky Thirteen</q> issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1621">CVE-2013-1621</a>

    <p>An array index error might allow remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service via vectors involving a crafted padding-length value
    during validation of CBC padding in a TLS session.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1622">CVE-2013-1622</a>

    <p>Malformed CBC data in a TLS session could allow remote attackers to
    conduct distinguishing attacks via statistical analysis of timing
    side-channel data for crafted packets.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), and the  unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.1.4-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.</p>
