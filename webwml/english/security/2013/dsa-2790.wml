<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw was found in the way the Mozilla Network Security Service library
(nss) read uninitialized data when there was a decryption failure. A
remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service
(application crash) for applications linked with the nss library.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.4-1.</p>

<p>The packages in the stable distribution were updated to the latest patch
release 3.14.4 of the library to also include a regression bugfix for a
flaw that affects the libpkix certificate verification cache. More
information can be found via:</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
