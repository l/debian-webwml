<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were identified in WordPress, a web blogging
tool. As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and
specific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to
upgrade the wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead of
backporting the patches.</p>

<p>This means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when
using third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been
impacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install
before doing the upgrade.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2173">CVE-2013-2173</a>

    <p>A denial of service was found in the way WordPress performs hash
    computation when checking password for protected posts. An attacker
    supplying carefully crafted input as a password could make the
    platform use excessive CPU usage.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2199">CVE-2013-2199</a>

    <p>Multiple server-side requests forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities were
    found in the HTTP API. This is related to
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0235">CVE-2013-0235</a>,
    which was specific to SSRF in pingback requests and was fixed in 3.5.1.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2200">CVE-2013-2200</a>

     <p>Inadequate checking of a user's capabilities could lead to a
     privilege escalation, enabling them to publish posts when their
     user role should not allow for it and to assign posts to other
     authors.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2201">CVE-2013-2201</a>

    <p>Multiple cross-side scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities due to badly
    escaped input were found in the media files and plugins upload forms.</p></li>

    <p>A Full path disclosure (FPD) was found in the file upload mechanism.
    If the upload directory is not writable, the error message returned
    includes the full directory path.</p></li>
