<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libmodplug, a library for
mod music based on ModPlug, that might allow arbitrary code execution
when processing specially-crafted ABC files through applications using
the library, such as media players.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.1-1+squeeze2+git20130828.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.4-3+deb7u1+git20130828.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:0.8.8.4-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmodplug packages.</p>
