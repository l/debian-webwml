<define-tag description>directory traversal</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Rainer Koirikivi discovered a directory traversal vulnerability with
<q>ssi</q> template tags in python-django, a high-level Python web
development framework.</p>

<p>It was shown that the handling of the <q>ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS</q> setting,
used to represent allowed prefixes for the {% ssi %} template tag, is
vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, by specifying a file path
which begins as the absolute path of a directory in
<q>ALLOWED_INCLUDE_ROOTS</q>, and then uses relative paths to break free.</p>

<p>To exploit this vulnerability an attacker must be in a position to alter
templates on the site, or the site to be attacked must have one or more
templates making use of the <q>ssi</q> tag, and must allow some form of
unsanitized user input to be used as an argument to the <q>ssi</q> tag.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
