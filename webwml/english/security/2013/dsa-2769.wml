<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the FreeBSD kernel that may
lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5691">CVE-2013-5691</a>

    <p>Loganaden Velvindron and Gleb Smirnoff discovered that the SIOCSIFADDR,
    SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR and SIOCSIFNETMASK ioctl requests do not
    perform input validation or verify the caller's credentials.
    Unprivileged user with the ability to run arbitrary code can cause any
    network interface in the system to perform the link layer actions
    associated with the above ioctl requests or trigger a kernel panic by
    passing a specially crafted address structure which causes a network
    interface driver to dereference an invalid pointer.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-5710">CVE-2013-5710</a>

    <p>Konstantin Belousov discovered that the nullfs(5) implementation of the
    VOP_LINK(9) VFS operation does not check whether the source and target of
    the link are both in the same nullfs instance. It is therefore possible to
    create a hardlink from a location in one nullfs instance to a file in
    another, as long as the underlying (source) filesystem is the same. If
    multiple nullfs views into the same filesystem are mounted in different
    locations, a user may gain write access to files which are nominally on
    a read-only filesystem.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.0-10+deb70.4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kfreebsd-9 packages.</p>
