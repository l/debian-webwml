<define-tag description>exposure of sensitive information</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yamada Yasuharu discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, is
vulnerable to expose potentially sensitive information when doing
requests across domains with matching tails. Due to a bug in the
tailmatch function when matching domain names, it was possible that
cookies set for a domain <q>ample.com</q> could accidentally also be sent
by libcurl when communicating with <q>example.com</q>.</p>

<p>Both curl the command line tool and applications using the libcurl
library are vulnerable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.21.0-2.1+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.29.0-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
