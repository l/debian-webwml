<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Squid3, a fully featured Web proxy cache, is prone to a denial of
service attack due to memory consumption caused by memory leaks in
cachemgr.cgi:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5643">CVE-2012-5643</a>

    <p>squid's cachemgr.cgi was vulnerable to excessive resource use.
    A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to perform a denial of
    service attack on the server and other hosted services.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-0189">CVE-2013-0189</a>

    <p>The original patch for <a
    href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5643">CVE-2012-5643</a>
    was incomplete. A remote attacker still could exploit this flaw
    to perform a denial of service attack.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.6-1.2+squeeze3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.20-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
