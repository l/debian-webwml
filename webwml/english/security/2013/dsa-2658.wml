    <p>Mitsumasa Kondo and Kyotaro Horiguchi of NTT Open Source Software Center
    discovered that it was possible for a connection request containing a
    database name that begins with <q>-</q> to be crafted that can damage or
    destroy files within a server's data directory. Anyone with access to the
    port the PostgreSQL server listens on can initiate this request.</p></li>

    <p>Random numbers generated by contrib/pgcrypto functions may be easy for
    another database user to guess.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-1901">CVE-2013-1901</a>
