<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matthew Horsfall of Dyn, Inc. discovered that BIND, a DNS server, is
prone to a denial of service vulnerability. A remote attacker could use
this flaw to send a specially-crafted DNS query to named that, when
processed, would cause named to use an excessive amount of memory, or
possibly crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze10.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
