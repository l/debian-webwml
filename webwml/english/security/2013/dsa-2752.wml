<define-tag description>permissions too wide</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andreas Beckmann discovered that phpBB, a web forum, as installed in
Debian, sets incorrect permissions for cached files, allowing a
malicious local user to overwrite them.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.7-PL1-4+squeeze1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.10-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb3 packages.</p>
