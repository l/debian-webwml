<define-tag description>missing input sanitation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>KB Sriram discovered that GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard did not
sufficiently sanitise public keys on import, which could lead to
memory and keyring corruption.</p>

<p>The problem affects both version 1, in the <q>gnupg</q> package, and
version two, in the <q>gnupg2</q> package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze1 of gnupg and version 2.0.19-2+squeeze1 of
gnupg2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (wheezy) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.12-7 of gnupg and
version 2.0.19-2 of gnupg2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg and/or gnupg2 packages.</p>
