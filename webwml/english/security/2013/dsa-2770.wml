<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>John Fitzpatrick of MWR InfoSecurity discovered an authentication bypass
vulnerability in torque, a PBS-derived batch processing queueing system.</p>

<p>The torque authentication model revolves around the use of privileged
ports. If a request is not made from a privileged port then it is
assumed not to be trusted or authenticated. It was found that pbs_mom
does not perform a check to ensure that connections are established
from a privileged port.</p>

<p>A user who can run jobs or login to a node running pbs_server or pbs_mom
can exploit this vulnerability to remotely execute code as root on the
cluster by submitting a command directly to a pbs_mom daemon
to queue and run a job.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.8+dfsg-9squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.16+dfsg-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your torque packages.</p>
