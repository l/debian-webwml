<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrew Tinits reported a potentially exploitable buffer overflow in the
Mozilla Network Security Service library (nss). With a specially crafted
request a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.12.8-1+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.14.5-1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.15.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
