<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>James Forshaw from Context Information Security discovered several
vulnerabilities in xml-security-c, an implementation of the XML Digital
Security specification. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2153">CVE-2013-2153</a>

    <p>The implementation of XML digital signatures in the Santuario-C++
    library is vulnerable to a spoofing issue allowing an attacker to
    reuse existing signatures with arbitrary content.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2154">CVE-2013-2154</a>

    <p>A stack overflow, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution,
    exists in the processing of malformed XPointer expressions in the
    XML Signature Reference processing code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2155">CVE-2013-2155</a>

    <p>A bug in the processing of the output length of an HMAC-based XML
    Signature would cause a denial of service when processing specially
    chosen input.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2156">CVE-2013-2156</a>

    <p>A heap overflow exists in the processing of the PrefixList attribute
    optionally used in conjunction with Exclusive Canonicalization,
    potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.1-3+squeeze2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.</p>
