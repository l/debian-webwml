<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Weimer discovered two security problems in the Chrony time
synchronisation software (buffer overflows and use of uninitialised data
in command replies).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon in 1.24-3+squeeze1 (due to a technical restriction in the archive
processing scripts the two updates cannot be released together).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.</p>
