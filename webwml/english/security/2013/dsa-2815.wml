<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Christoph Biedl discovered two denial of service vulnerabilities in
munin, a network-wide graphing framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6048">CVE-2013-6048</a>

    <p>The Munin::Master::Node module of munin does not properly validate
    certain data a node sends. A malicious node might exploit this to
    drive the munin-html process into an infinite loop with memory
    exhaustion on the munin master.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6359">CVE-2013-6359</a>

    <p>A malicious node, with a plugin enabled using <q>multigraph</q> as a
    multigraph service name, can abort data collection for the entire
    node the plugin runs on.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.6-4+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your munin packages.</p>
