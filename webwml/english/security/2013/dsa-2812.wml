<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two security issues were found in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and
login server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4408">CVE-2013-4408</a>

    <p>It was discovered that multiple buffer overflows in the processing
    of DCE-RPC packets may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-4475">CVE-2013-4475</a>

    <p>Hemanth Thummala discovered that ACLs were not checked when opening
    files with alternate data streams. This issue is only exploitable
    if the VFS modules vfs_streams_depot and/or vfs_streams_xattr are
    used.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.6-6+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
