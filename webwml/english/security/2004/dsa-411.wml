<define-tag description>format string vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in mpg321, a command-line mp3 player,
whereby user-supplied strings were passed to printf(3) unsafely.  This
vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker to overwrite
memory, and possibly execute arbitrary code.  In order for this
vulnerability to be exploited, mpg321 would need to play a malicious
mp3 file (including via HTTP streaming).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.2.10.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.10.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mpg321 package.</p>
