<define-tag description>infinite loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The upstream developers of Ruby have corrected a problem in the CGI
module for this language.  Specially crafted requests could cause an
infinite loop and thus cause the program to eat up cpu cycles.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.7-3woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-12 of ruby1.6 and in version 1.8.1+1.8.2pre2-4 of
ruby1.8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby packages.</p>
