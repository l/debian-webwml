<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An iDEFENSE security researcher discovered a buffer overflow in xpdf,
the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite.  Similar code is present in
the PDF processing part of CUPS.  A maliciously crafted PDF file could
exploit this problem, leading to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody11.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.22-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages.</p>
