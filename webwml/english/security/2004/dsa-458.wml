<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This security advisory corrects DSA 458-1 which caused some
segmentation faults in gethostbyaddr with non-localhost input.  This
update also disables IPv6 on all architectures.</p>

<p>The original advisory said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Sebastian Schmidt discovered a buffer overflow bug in Python's
getaddrinfo function, which could allow an IPv6 address, supplied by a
remote attacker via DNS, to overwrite memory on the stack.</p>

<p>This bug only exists in python 2.2 and 2.2.1, and only when IPv6
support is disabled.  The python2.2 package in Debian woody meets
these conditions (the 'python' package does not).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this bug has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4.5.</p>

<p>The testing and unstable distribution (sarge and sid) are not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your python2.2 package.</p>
