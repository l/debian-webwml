<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sebastian Schmidt discovered a buffer overflow bug in Python's
getaddrinfo function, which could allow an IPv6 address, supplied by a
remote attacker via DNS, to overwrite memory on the stack.</p>

<p>This bug only exists in python 2.2 and 2.2.1, and only when IPv6
support is disabled.  The python2.2 package in Debian woody meets
these conditions (the 'python' package does not).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this bug has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-4.3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this bug.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your python2.2 package.</p>
