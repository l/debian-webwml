<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in the ODBC driver of PostgreSQL,
an object-relational SQL database, descended from POSTGRES.  It is possible
to exploit this problem and crash the surrounding application.  Hence, a
PHP script using php4-odbc can be utilised to crash the surrounding
Apache webserver.  Other parts of postgresql are not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.2.1-2woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 07.03.0200-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql and related package.</p>
