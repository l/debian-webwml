<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Georgi Guninski discovered a buffer overflow bug in Apache's mod_proxy
module, whereby a remote user could potentially cause arbitrary code
to be executed with the privileges of an Apache httpd child process
(by default, user www-data).  Note that this bug is only exploitable
if the mod_proxy module is in use.</p>

<p>Note that this bug exists in a module in the apache-common package,
shared by apache, apache-ssl and apache-perl, so this update is
sufficient to correct the bug for all three builds of Apache httpd.
However, on systems using apache-ssl or apache-perl, httpd will not
automatically be restarted.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.3.26-0woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.31-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your apache package.</p>
