<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Carlos Barros has discovered a buffer overflow in the HTTP
authentication routine of mpg123, a popular (but non-free) MPEG layer
1/2/3 audio player.  If a user opened a malicious playlist or URL, an
attacker might execute arbitrary code with the rights of the calling
user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.59r-13woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.59r-17.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mpg123 package.</p>
