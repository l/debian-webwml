<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit Project
noticed that the debstd script from
debmake, a deprecated helper package for Debian packaging, created
temporary directories in an insecure manner.  This can be exploited by
a malicious user to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the victim.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.10.woody.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your debmake package.</p>
