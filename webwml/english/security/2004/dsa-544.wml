<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ludwig Nussel discovered a problem in webmin, a web-based
administration toolkit.  A temporary directory was used but without
checking for the previous owner.  This could allow an attacker to
create the directory and place dangerous symbolic links inside.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.94-7woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.160-1 of webmin and 1.090-1 of usermin.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webmin packages.</p>
