<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered a number of vulnerabilities in emil, a
filter for converting Internet mail messages.  The vulnerabilities
fall into two categories:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0152">CAN-2004-0152</a>
   <p>Buffer overflows in (1) the encode_mime function,
   (2) the encode_uuencode function, (3) the decode_uuencode
   function.  These bugs could allow a carefully crafted email message
   to cause the execution of arbitrary code supplied with the message
   when it is acted upon by emil.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0153">CAN-2004-0153</a>
   <p>Format string bugs in statements which print
   various error messages.  The exploit potential of these bugs has
   not been established, and is probably configuration-dependent.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-beta9-11woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your emil package.</p>
