<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered a heap overflow in the CVS server, which
serves the popular Concurrent Versions System.  Malformed "Entry"
Lines in combination with Is-modified and Unchanged can be used to
overflow malloc()ed memory.  This was proven to be exploitable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.1p1debian-9woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.5-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvs package immediately.</p>
