<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Starzetz <a href="http://isec.pl/vulnerabilities/isec-0013-mremap.txt">discovered</A> a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in the
Linux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may allow
a local attacker to gain root privileges.
Version 2.2 is not affected by this bug, since it doesn't support the
MREMAP_FIXED flag (as <a href="http://seclists.org/lists/fulldisclosure/2004/Jan/0095.html">clarified later</A>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
kernel-source version 2.4.18-14.1 and kernel-images versions
2.4.18-12.1 and 2.4.18-5woody6 (bf) for the i386 architecture.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon
with newly uploaded packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages.  This problem has
been fixed in the upstream version 2.4.24 as well.</p>
