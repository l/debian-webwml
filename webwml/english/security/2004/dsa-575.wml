<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A temporary file problem has been discovered in xlsview from the
catdoc suite, convertors from Word to TeX and plain text, which could
lead to local users being able to overwrite arbitrary files via a
symlink attack on predictable temporary file names.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91.5-1.woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your catdoc package.</p>
