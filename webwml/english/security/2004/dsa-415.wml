<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in zebra, an IP routing daemon:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0795">CAN-2003-0795</a> - a bug in the telnet CLI could allow a remote attacker
to cause a zebra process to crash, resulting in a denial of service.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0858">CAN-2003-0858</a> - netlink messages sent by other users (rather than the
kernel) would be accepted, leading to a denial of service.</li>

</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.92a-5woody2.</p>

<p>The zebra package has been obsoleted in the unstable distribution by
GNU Quagga, where this problem was fixed in version 0.96.4x-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your zebra package.</p>
