<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered a vulnerability in pavuk, a file retrieval
program, whereby an oversized HTTP 305 response sent by a malicious
server could cause arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges
of the pavuk process.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.9pl28-1woody1.</p>

<p>pavuk is no longer included in the unstable distribution of Debian.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your pavuk package.</p>
