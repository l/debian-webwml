<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Samba, a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix, was found
to contain a vulnerability whereby a local user could use the "smbmnt"
utility, which is setuid root, to mount a file share from a remote
server which contained setuid programs under the control of the user.
These programs could then be executed to gain privileges on the local
system.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.2.3a-13.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your samba package.</p>
