<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Primoz Bratanic discovered a bug in libpam-psgl, a PAM module to
authenticate using a PostgreSQL database.  The library does not escape
all user-supplied data that are sent to the database.  An attacker
could exploit this bug to insert SQL statements.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-7.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-pgsql package.</p>
