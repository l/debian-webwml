<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler noticed that yardradius, the YARD radius authentication
and accounting server, contained a stack overflow similar to the one
from radiusd which is referenced as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2001-0534">CAN-2001-0534</a>.  This could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code as root.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.20-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.20-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your yardradius package immediately.</p>
