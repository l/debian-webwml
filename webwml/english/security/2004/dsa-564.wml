<p>Davide Del Vecchio discovered a vulnerability mpg123, a popular (but
non-free) MPEG layer 1/2/3 audio player.  A malicious MPEG layer 2/3
file could cause the header checks in mpg123 to fail, which could in
turn allow arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the
user running mpg123.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.59r-13woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.59r-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mpg123 package.</p>
