<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in www-sql,
a CGI program which enables the creation of dynamic web pages by
embedding SQL statements in HTML.  By exploiting this
vulnerability, a local user could cause the execution of arbitrary
code by creating a web page and processing it with www-sql.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.5.7-17woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your www-sql package.</p>
