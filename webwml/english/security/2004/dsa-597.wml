<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered several security related problems in the Cyrus
IMAP daemon.  Due to a bug in the command parser it is possible to
access memory beyond the allocated buffer in two places which could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.19-9.2</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd package immediately.</p>
