<define-tag description>insecure file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered a vulnerability in
synaesthesia, a program which represents sounds visually.
synaesthesia created its configuration file while holding root
privileges, allowing a local user to create files owned by root and
writable by the user's primary group.  This type of vulnerability can
usually be easily exploited to execute arbitrary code with root
privileges by various means.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.1-2.1woody1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem, because
synaesthesia is no longer setuid.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your synaesthesia package.</p>
