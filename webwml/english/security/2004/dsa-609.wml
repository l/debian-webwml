<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Adam Zabrocki discovered multiple buffer overflows in atari800, an
Atari emulator.  In order to directly access graphics hardware, one of
the affected programs is installed setuid root.  A local attacker
could exploit this vulnerability to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your atari800 package immediately.</p>
