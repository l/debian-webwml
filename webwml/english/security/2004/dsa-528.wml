<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several denial of service vulnerabilities were discovered in ethereal,
a network traffic analyzer.  These vulnerabilities are described in the
ethereal advisory "enpa-sa-00015".  Of these, only one (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0635">CAN-2004-0635</a>)
affects the version of ethereal in Debian woody.  This vulnerability
could be exploited by a remote attacker to crash ethereal with an
invalid SNMP packet.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.9.4-1woody8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your ethereal package.</p>
