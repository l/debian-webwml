<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Julian Reschke reported a problem in mod_dav of Apache 2 in connection
with a NULL pointer dereference.  When running in a threaded model,
especially with Apache 2, a segmentation fault can take out a whole
process and hence create a denial of service for the whole server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.3-3.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.3-10 of libapache-mod-dav and in version 2.0.51-1 of
Apache 2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mod_dav packages.</p>
