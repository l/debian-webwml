<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" discovered a buffer overflow in htget, a file grabber
that will get files from HTTP servers.  It is possible to overflow a
buffer and execute arbitrary code by accessing a malicious URL.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.93-1.1woody1.</p>

<p>This package is not present in the testing and unstable distributions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your htget package.</p>
