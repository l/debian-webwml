<define-tag description>buffer overflow, format string bugs</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered two format string bugs (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0104">CAN-2004-0104</a>) and
two buffer overflow bugs (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0105">CAN-2004-0105</a>) in metamail, an
implementation of MIME.  An attacker could create a carefully-crafted
mail message which will execute arbitrary code as the victim when it
is opened and parsed through metamail.</p>

<p>We have been devoting some effort to trying to avoid shipping metamail
in the future.  It became unmaintainable and these are probably not
the last of the vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.7-45woody.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed in
version 2.7-45.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your metamail package.</p>
