<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Evgeny Demidov discovered a potential buffer overflow in a Kerberos 4
component of heimdal, a free implementation of Kerberos 5.  The
problem is present in kadmind, a server for administrative access to
the Kerberos database.  This problem could perhaps be exploited to
cause the daemon to read a negative amount of data which could lead to
unexpected behaviour.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4e-7.woody.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal and related packages.</p>
