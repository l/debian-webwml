<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several developers have discovered a number of problems in the libXpm
library which is provided by X.Org, XFree86 and LessTif.  These bugs
can be exploited by remote and/or local attackers to gain access to
the system or to escalate their local privileges, by using a specially
crafted XPM image.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-16woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xlibs package immediately.</p>
