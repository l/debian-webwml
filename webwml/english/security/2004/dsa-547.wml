<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner from SUSE has discovered several buffer overflows in
the ImageMagick graphics library.  An attacker could create a
malicious image or video file in AVI, BMP, or DIB format that could
crash the reading process.  It might be possible that carefully
crafted images could also allow to execute arbitrary code with the
capabilities of the invoking process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
