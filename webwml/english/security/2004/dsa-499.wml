<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in rsync, a file transfer program,
whereby a remote user could cause an rsync daemon to write files
outside of the intended directory tree.  This vulnerability is not
exploitable when the daemon is configured with the 'chroot' option.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.5.5-0.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your rsync package.</p>
