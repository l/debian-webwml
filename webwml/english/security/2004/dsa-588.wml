<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Trustix developers discovered insecure temporary file creation in
supplemental scripts in the gzip package which may allow local users
to overwrite files via a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-3woody3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gzip package.</p>
