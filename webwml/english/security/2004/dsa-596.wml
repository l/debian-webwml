<p>Liam Helmer noticed that sudo, a program that provides limited super
user privileges to specific users, does not clean the environment
sufficiently.  Bash functions and the CDPATH variable are still passed
through to the program running as privileged user, leaving
possibilities to overload system routines.  These vulnerabilities can
only be exploited by users who have been granted limited super user
privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.8p3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.</p>
