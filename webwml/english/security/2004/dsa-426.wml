<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>netpbm is a graphics conversion toolkit made up of a large number of
single-purpose programs.  Many of these programs were found to create
temporary files in an insecure manner, which could allow a local
attacker to overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking a
vulnerable netpbm tool.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 2:9.20-8.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:9.25-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your netpbm-free package.</p>
