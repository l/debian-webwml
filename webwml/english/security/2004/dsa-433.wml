<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Red Hat and SuSE kernel and security teams revealed an integer overflow
in the do_brk() function of the Linux kernel allows local users to
gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.17-0.020226.2.woody4.  Other architectures are already or
will be fixed separately.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon
with newly uploaded packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel image packages for the mips
and mipsel architectures.  This problem has been fixed in the upstream
version 2.4.23 as well and is also present in 2.4.24, of course.</p>
