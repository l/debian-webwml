<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered a problem in neon, an HTTP and WebDAV client
library.  User input is copied into variables not large enough for all
cases.  This can lead to an overflow of a static heap variable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.19.3-2woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.23.9.dfsg-2 and neon_0.24.6.dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libneon* packages.</p>
