<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered several integer overflows in xpdf, that are
also present in tetex-bin, binary files for the teTeX distribution,
which can be exploited remotely by a specially crafted PDF document
and lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 20011202-7.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-23.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tetex-bin packages.</p>
