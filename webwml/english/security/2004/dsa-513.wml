<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>jaguar@felinemenace.org discovered a format string vulnerability in
log2mail, whereby a user able to log a specially crafted message to a
logfile monitored by log2mail (for example, via syslog) could cause
arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of the log2mail
process.  By default, this process runs as user 'log2mail', which is a
member of group 'adm' (which has access to read system logfiles).</p>

printlog()</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.2.5.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your log2mail package.</p>
