<p>Simon Josefsson noticed that the tspc.conf configuration file in
freenet6, a client to configure an IPv6 tunnel to freenet6.net, is set
world readable.  This file can contain the username and the password
used to contact the IPv6 tunnelbroker freenet6.net.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0-2.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freenet6 package.</p>
