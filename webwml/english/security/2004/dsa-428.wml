<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in slocate, a program to index and
search for files, whereby a specially crafted database could overflow
a heap-based buffer.  This vulnerability could be exploited by a local
attacker to gain the privileges of the "slocate" group, which can
access the global database containing a list of pathnames of all files
on the system, including those which should only be visible to
privileged users.</p>

<p>This problem, and a category of potential similar problems, have been
fixed by modifying slocate to drop privileges before reading a
user-supplied database.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.6-1.3.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian bug <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/226103">#226103</a> 
for status information.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your slocate package.</p>
