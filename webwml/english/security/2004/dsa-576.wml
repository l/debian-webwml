<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squid, the
internet object cache, the popular WWW proxy cache.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-1999-0710">CVE-1999-0710</a>

    <p>It is possible to bypass access lists and scan arbitrary hosts and
    ports in the network through cachemgr.cgi, which is installed by
    default.  This update disables this feature and introduces a
    configuration file (/etc/squid/cachemgr.conf) to control
    this behavier.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0918">CAN-2004-0918</a>

    <p>The asn_parse_header function (asn1.c) in the SNMP module for
    Squid allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via
    certain SNMP packets with negative length fields that causes a
    memory allocation error.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.6-2woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid package.</p>
