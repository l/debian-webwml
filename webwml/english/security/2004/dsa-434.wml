<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered several security related problems in Gaim, a
multi-protocol instant messaging client.  Not all of them are
applicable for the version in Debian stable, but affected the version
in the unstable distribution at least.  The problems were grouped for
the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0005">CAN-2004-0005</a>

    <p>When the Yahoo Messenger handler decodes an octal value for email
    notification functions two different kinds of overflows can be
    triggered.  When the MIME decoder decoded a quoted printable
    encoded string for email notification two other different kinds of
    overflows can be triggered.  These problems only affect the
    version in the unstable distribution.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0006">CAN-2004-0006</a>

    <p>When parsing the cookies within the HTTP reply header of a Yahoo
    web connection a buffer overflow can happen.  When parsing the
    Yahoo Login Webpage the YMSG protocol overflows stack buffers if
    the web page returns oversized values.  When splitting an URL into
    its parts a stack overflow can be caused.  These problems only
    affect the version in the unstable distribution.</p>

    <p>When an oversized keyname is read from a Yahoo Messenger packet a
    stack overflow can be triggered.  When Gaim is setup to use a HTTP
    proxy for connecting to the server a malicious HTTP proxy can
    exploit it.  These problems affect all versions Debian ships.
    However, the connection to Yahoo doesn't work in the version in
    Debian stable.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0007">CAN-2004-0007</a>

    <p>Internally data is copied between two tokens into a fixed size
    stack buffer without a size check.  This only affects the version
    of gaim in the unstable distribution.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0008">CAN-2004-0008</a>

    <p>When allocating memory for AIM/Oscar DirectIM packets an integer
    overflow can happen, resulting in a heap overflow.  This only
    affects the version of gaim in the unstable distribution.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems has been fixed in
version 0.58-2.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems has been fixed in
version 0.75-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gaim packages.</p>
