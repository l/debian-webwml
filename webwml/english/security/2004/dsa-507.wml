<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered a problem in neon, an HTTP and WebDAV client
library, which is also present in cadaver, a command-line client for
WebDAV server.  User input is copied into variables not large enough
for all cases.  This can lead to an overflow of a static heap
variable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.18.0-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.22.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cadaver package.</p>
