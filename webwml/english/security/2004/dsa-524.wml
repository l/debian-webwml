<define-tag moreinfo>
<p><email jaguar@felinemenace.org> discovered a format string vulnerability in
rlpr, a utility for lpd printing without using /etc/printcap.  While
investigating this vulnerability, a buffer overflow was also
discovered in related code.  By exploiting one of these
vulnerabilities, a local or remote user could potentially cause
arbitrary code to be executed with the privileges of 1) the rlprd
process (remote), or 2) root (local).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.02-7woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your rlpr package.</p>
