<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Georgi Guninski discovered two stack-based buffer overflows in exim
and exim-tls.  They cannot be exploited with the default
configuration from the Debian system, though.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems that are fixed with this update:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0399">CAN-2004-0399</a>

    <p>When "sender_verify = true" is configured in exim.conf a buffer
    overflow can happen during verification of the sender.  This
    problem is fixed in exim 4.

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0400">CAN-2004-0400</a>

    <p>When headers_check_syntax is configured in exim.conf a buffer
    overflow can happen during the header check.  This problem does
    also exist in exim 4.

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.35-3woody2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain exim-tls anymore.
The functionality has been incorporated in the main exim versions
which have these problems fixed in version 3.36-11 for exim 3 and in
version 4.33-1 for exim 4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim-tls package.</p>
