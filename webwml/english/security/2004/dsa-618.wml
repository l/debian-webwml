<define-tag description>buffer overflows, integer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Pavel Kankovsky discovered that several overflows found in the libXpm
library were also present in imlib, an imaging library for X and X11.
An attacker could create a carefully crafted image file in such a way
that it could cause an application linked with imlib to execute
arbitrary code when the file was opened by a victim.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1025">CAN-2004-1025</a>

    <p>Multiple heap-based buffer overflows.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-1026">CAN-2004-1026</a>

    <p>Multiple integer overflows.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.14-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.14-17.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imlib packages immediately.</p>
