<p>The account management of the CVS pserver (which is used to give remote
access to CVS repositories) uses a CVSROOT/passwd file in each
repository which contains the accounts and their authentication
information as well as the name of the local unix account to use when a
pserver account is used. Since CVS performed no checking on what unix
account was specified anyone who could modify the CVSROOT/passwd could
gain access to all local users on the CVS server, including root.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in upstream version 1.11.11 by preventing pserver
from running as root. For Debian this problem is solved in version
1.11.1p1debian-9 in two different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>pserver is no longer allowed to use root to access repositories</li>

<li>a new /etc/cvs-repouid is introduced which can be used by the system
  administrator to override the unix account used to access a
  repository. More information on this change can be found at
  http://www.wiggy.net/code/cvs-repouid/</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionaly, CVS pserver had a bug in parsing module requests which
could be used to create files and directories outside a repository.
This has been fixed upstream in version 1.11.11 and Debian version
1.11.1p1debian-9.</p>

<p>Finally, the umask used for 'cvs init' and 'cvs-makerepos' has been
changed to prevent repositories from being created with group write
permissions.</p>
