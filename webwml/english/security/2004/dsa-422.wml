<p>The account management of the CVS pserver (which is used to give remote
access to CVS repositories) uses a <kbd>CVSROOT/passwd</kbd> file in each
repository which contains the accounts and their authentication
information as well as the name of the local unix account to use when a
pserver account is used. Since CVS performed no checking on what unix
account was specified anyone who could modify the <kbd>CVSROOT/passwd</kbd>
could gain access to all local users on the CVS server, including root.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in upstream version 1.11.11 by preventing pserver
from running as root. For Debian this problem is solved in version
1.11.1p1debian-9 in two different ways:</p>

<ul>
<li>pserver is no longer allowed to use root to access repositories</li>

<li>a new <kbd>/etc/cvs-repouid</kbd> is introduced which can be used by the
  system administrator to override the unix account used to access a
  repository. More information on this change can be found at
  <url "http://www.wiggy.net/code/cvs-repouid/"></li>
</ul>

<p>Additionaly, CVS pserver had a bug in parsing module requests which
could be used to create files and directories outside a repository.
This has been fixed upstream in version 1.11.11 and Debian version
1.11.1p1debian-9.</p>

<p>Finally, the umask used for &ldquo;cvs init&rdquo; and
&ldquo;cvs-makerepos&rdquo; has been
changed to prevent repositories from being created with group write
permissions.</p>
