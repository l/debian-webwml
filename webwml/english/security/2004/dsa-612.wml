<p>Rudolf Polzer discovered a vulnerability in a2ps, a converter and
pretty-printer for many formats to PostScript.  The program did not
escape shell meta characters properly which could lead to the
execution of arbitrary commands as a privileged user if a2ps is
installed as a printer filter.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.13b-16woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.13b-4.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your a2ps package.</p>
