<p>Several problems have been discovered in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  An attacker could
prepare a specially crafted TIFF graphic that would cause the client
to execute arbitrary code or crash.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project has identified the following problems:</p>

<ul>

    <p>Chris Evans discovered several problems in the RLE (run length
    encoding) decoders that could lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>

    <p>Matthias Clasen discovered a division by zero through an integer
    overflow.</p>

    <p>Dmitry V. Levin discovered several integer overflows that caused
    malloc issues which can result to either plain crash or memory
    corruption.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.6.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff package.</p>
