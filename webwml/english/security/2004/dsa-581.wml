<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Evans discovered several integer overflows in xpdf, a viewer for
PDF files, which can be exploited remotely by a specially crafted PDF
document and lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.00-3.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.00-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf package.</p>
