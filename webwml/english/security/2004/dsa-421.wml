<define-tag description>password expiration</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>David B Harris discovered a problem with mod-auth-shadow, an Apache
module which authenticates users against the system shadow password
database, where the expiration status of the user's account and
password were not enforced.  This vulnerability would allow an
otherwise authorized user to successfully authenticate, when the
attempt should be rejected due to the expiration parameters.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.3-3.1woody.1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mod-auth-shadow package.</p>
