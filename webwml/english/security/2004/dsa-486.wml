<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered and fixed in CVS:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0180">CAN-2004-0180</a>

 <p>Sebastian Krahmer discovered a vulnerability whereby
 a malicious CVS pserver could create arbitary files on the client
 system during an update or checkout operation, by supplying absolute
 pathnames in RCS diffs.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0405">CAN-2004-0405</a>

 <p>Derek Robert Price discovered a vulnerability whereby
 a CVS pserver could be abused by a malicious client to view the
 contents of certain files outside of the CVS root directory using
 relative pathnames containing "../".</p>

</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.11.1p1debian-9woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your cvs package.</p>
