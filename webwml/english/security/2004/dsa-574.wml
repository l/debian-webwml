<define-tag description>missing directory sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The upstream developers discovered a problem in cabextract, a tool to
extract cabinet files.  The program was able to overwrite files in
upper directories.  This could lead an attacker to overwrite arbitrary
files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2-2b.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cabextract package.</p>
