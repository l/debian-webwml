<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in webmin:</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0582">CAN-2004-0582</a>: Unknown vulnerability in Webmin 1.140 allows remote
 attackers to bypass access control rules and gain read access to
 configuration information for a module.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0583">CAN-2004-0583</a>: The account lockout functionality in (1) Webmin 1.140
 and (2) Usermin 1.070 does not parse certain character strings, which
 allows remote attackers to conduct a brute force attack to guess user
 IDs and passwords.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been
fixed in version 0.94-7woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.150-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your webmin package.</p>
