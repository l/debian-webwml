<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Leon Juranic discovered a buffer overflow related to the
getpass(3) library function in
calife, a program which provides super user privileges to specific
users.  A local attacker could potentially
exploit this vulnerability, given knowledge of a local user's password
and the presence of at least one entry in /etc/calife.auth, to execute
arbitrary code with root privileges.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.8.4c-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your calife package.</p>
