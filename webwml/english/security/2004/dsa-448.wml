<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in pwlib, a library used to
aid in writing portable applications, whereby a remote attacker could
cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code.  This
library is most notably used in several applications implementing the
H.323 teleconferencing protocol, including the OpenH323 suite,
gnomemeeting and asterisk.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.5-5woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian Bug<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/233888">#233888</a> for details.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your pwlib package.</p>
