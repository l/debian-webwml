<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Max Vozeler discovered a vulnerability in pppoe, the PPP over Ethernet
driver from Roaring Penguin.  When the program is running setuid root
(which is not the case in a default Debian installation), an attacker
could overwrite any file on the file system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3-1.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pppoe package.</p>
