<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Apache Software Foundation announced that some versions of
mod_python contain a bug which, when processing a request with a
malformed query string, could cause the corresponding Apache child to
crash.  This bug could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause a
denial of service.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2:2.7.8-0.0woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.7.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your libapache-mod-python package.</p>
