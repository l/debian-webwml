<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luke "infamous41md" discoverd multiple vulnerabilities in xzgv, a
picture viewer for X11 with a thumbnail-based selector.  Remote
exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability could allow the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7-6woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xzgv package immediately.</p>
