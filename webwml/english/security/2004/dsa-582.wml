<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" discovered several buffer overflows in libxml and
libxml2, the XML C parser and toolkits for GNOME.  Missing boundary
checks could cause several buffers to be overflown, which may cause
the client to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The following vulnerability matrix lists corrected versions of these
libraries:</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.17-2woody2 of libxml and in version 2.4.19-4woody2 of
libxml2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.17-9 of libxml and in version 2.6.11-5 of libxml2.</p>

<p>These problems have also been fixed in version 2.6.15-1 of libxml2 in
the experimental distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml packages.</p>
