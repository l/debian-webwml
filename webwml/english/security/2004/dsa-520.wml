<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>In their advisory MITKRB5-SA-2004-001, the MIT Kerberos announced the
existence of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in the
krb5_aname_to_localname function.  This function is only used if
aname_to_localname is enabled in the configuration (this is not
enabled by default).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.4-5woody5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your krb5 package.</p>
