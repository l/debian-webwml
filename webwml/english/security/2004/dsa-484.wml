<define-tag description>failure to drop privileges</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a vulnerability in xonix, a game, where an
external program was invoked while retaining setgid privileges.  A
local attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain gid "games".</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem will be fixed
in version 1.4-19woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xonix package.</p>
