<p>Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure
which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
signing.</p>

<p>This update disables the use of this type of key.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.0.6-4woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version
1.2.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gnupg package.</p>
