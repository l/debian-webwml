<define-tag description>temporary directory vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The SUSE security team was alerted that in some cases the integrity of
symlinks used by KDE are not ensured and that these symlinks can be
pointing to stale locations.  This can be abused by a local attacker
to create or truncate arbitrary files or to prevent KDE applications
from functioning correctly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-13.woody.12.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kde packages.</p>
