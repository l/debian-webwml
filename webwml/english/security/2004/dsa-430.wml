<define-tag description>missing privilege release</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a problem in trr19, a type trainer application
for GNU Emacs, which is written as a pair of setgid() binaries and
wrapper programs which execute commands for GNU Emacs.  However, the
binaries don't drop privileges before executing a command, allowing an
attacker to gain access to the local group games.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0beta5-15woody1.  The mipsel binary will be added later.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trr19 package.</p>
