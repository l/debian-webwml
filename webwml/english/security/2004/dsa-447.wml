<define-tag description>format string</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project
discovered a format string
vulnerability in hsftp.  This vulnerability could be exploited by an
attacker able to create files on a remote server with carefully
crafted names, to which a user would connect using hsftp.  When the
user requests a directory listing, particular bytes in memory could be
overwritten, potentially allowing arbitrary code to be executed with
the privileges of the user invoking hsftp.</p>

<p>Note that while hsftp is installed setuid root, it only uses these
privileges to acquire locked memory, and then relinquishes them.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.11-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your hsftp package.</p>
