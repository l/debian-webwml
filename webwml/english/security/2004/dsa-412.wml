<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in nd, a command-line WebDAV
interface, whereby long strings received from the remote server could
overflow fixed-length buffers.  This vulnerability could be exploited
by a remote attacker in control of a malicious WebDAV server to
execute arbitrary code if the server was accessed by a vulnerable
version of nd.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.5.0-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your nd package.</p>
