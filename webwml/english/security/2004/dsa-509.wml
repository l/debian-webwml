<p>Steve Kemp discovered a vulnerability in xatitv, one of the programs
in the gatos package, which is used to display video with certain
ATI video cards.</p>

<p>xatitv is installed setuid root in order to gain direct access to the
video hardware.  It normally drops root privileges after successfully
initializing itself.  However, if initialization fails due to a
missing configuration file, root privileges are not dropped, and
xatitv executes the system(3) function to launch its configuration
program without sanitizing user-supplied environment variables.</p>

<p>By exploiting this vulnerability, a local user could gain root
privileges if the configuration file does not exist.  However, a
default configuration file is supplied with the package, and so this
vulnerability is not exploitable unless this file is removed by the
administrator.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.0.5-6woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gatos package.</p>
