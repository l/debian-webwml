<define-tag description>insecure file permissions</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andres Salomon noticed a problem in the CGI session management of
Ruby, an object-oriented scripting language.  CGI::Session's FileStore
(and presumably PStore, but not in Debian woody) implementations store
session information insecurely.  They simply create files, ignoring
permission issues.  This can lead an attacker who has also shell
access to the webserver to take over a session.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.7-3woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable and testing distributions (sarge and sid) this
problem has been fixed in version 1.8.1+1.8.2pre1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libruby package.</p>
