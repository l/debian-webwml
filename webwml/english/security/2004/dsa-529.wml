<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"b0f" discovered a format string vulnerability in netkit-telnet-ssl
which could potentially allow a remote attacker to cause the execution
of arbitrary code with the privileges of the telnet daemon (the
'telnetd' user by default).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.17.17+0.1-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.24+0.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your netkit-telnet-ssl package.</p>
