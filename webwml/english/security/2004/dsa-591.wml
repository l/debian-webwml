<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" discovered several integer overflows in the PNG image
decoding routines of the GD graphics library.  This could lead to the
execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.4-17.woody3 of libgd1 and in version 2.0.1-10woody1 of
libgd2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
