<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in wu-ftpd:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0148">CAN-2004-0148</a>

 <p>Glenn Stewart discovered that users could bypass the
 directory access restrictions imposed by the restricted-gid option by
 changing the permissions on their home directory.  On a subsequent
 login, when access to the user's home directory was denied, wu-ftpd
 would fall back to the root directory.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0185">CAN-2004-0185</a>

 <p>A buffer overflow existed in wu-ftpd's code which
 deals with S/key authentication.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3woody4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2-17.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your wu-ftpd package.</p>
