<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Trustix developers discovered insecure temporary file creation in a
supplemental script in the lvm10 package that didn't check for
existing temporary directories, allowing local users to overwrite
files via a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-5woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lvm10 package.</p>
