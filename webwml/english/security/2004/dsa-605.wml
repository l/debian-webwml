<define-tag description>settings not honored</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Haris Sehic discovered several vulnerabilities in viewcvs, a utility
for viewing CVS and Subversion repositories via HTTP.  When exporting
a repository as a tar archive the hide_cvsroot and forbidden settings
were not honoured enough.</p>

<p>When upgrading the package for woody, please make a copy of your
/etc/viewcvs/viewcvs.conf file if you have manually edited this file.
Upon upgrade the debconf mechanism may alter it in a way so that
viewcvs doesn't understand it anymore.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.2-4woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.2+cvs.1.0.dev.2004.07.28-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your viewcvs package.</p>
