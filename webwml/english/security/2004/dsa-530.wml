of the layer 2 tunneling protocol, whereby a remote attacker could
potentially cause arbitrary code to be executed by transmitting a
specially crafted packet.  The exploitability of this vulnerability
has not been verified.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.67-1.2.</p>
