<define-tag description>missing function return value check</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Starzetz and Wojciech Purczynski of isec.pl discovered a critical
security vulnerability in the memory management code of Linux inside
the mremap(2) system call.  Due to missing function return value check
of internal functions a local attacker can gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 011226.16 of ia64 kernel source and images.</p>

<p>Other architectures are or will be mentioned in a separate advisory
respectively or are not affected (m68k).</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed in version
2.4.24-3.</p>

<p>This problem is also fixed in the upstream version of Linux 2.4.25 and
2.6.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Linux kernel packages immediately.</p>
