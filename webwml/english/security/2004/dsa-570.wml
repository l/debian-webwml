<p>Several integer overflows have been discovered by its upstream
developers in libpng, a commonly used library to display PNG graphics.
They could be exploited to cause arbitrary code to be executed when a
specially crafted PNG image is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.12-3.woody.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.15-8.</p>
