<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Leon Juranic discovered that BNC, an IRC session bouncing proxy, does
not always protect buffers from being overwritten.  This could
exploited by a malicious IRC server to overflow a buffer of limited
size and execute arbitrary code on the client host.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.4-3.3.</p>

<p>This package does not exist in the testing or unstable distributions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bnc package.</p>
