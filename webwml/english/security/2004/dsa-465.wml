<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in openssl, an implementation of
the SSL protocol, using the Codenomicon TLS Test Tool.  More
information can be found in the following <a
href="http://www.uniras.gov.uk/vuls/2004/224012/index.htm">NISCC
Vulnerability Advisory <p>and this <a
href="http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20040317.txt">OpenSSL
advisory</a>.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identified the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0079">CAN-2004-0079</a>
   <p>Null-pointer assignment in the
   do_change_cipher_spec() function.  A remote attacker could perform
   a carefully crafted SSL/TLS handshake against a server that used
   the OpenSSL library in such a way as to cause OpenSSL to crash.
   Depending on the application this could lead to a denial of
   service.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0081">CAN-2004-0081</a>
   <p>A bug in older versions of OpenSSL 0.9.6 that
   can lead to a Denial of Service attack (infinite loop).</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
openssl version 0.9.6c-2.woody.6, openssl094 version 0.9.4-6.woody.4
and openssl095 version 0.9.5a-6.woody.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your openssl package.</p>
