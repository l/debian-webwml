<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a problem in
xitalk, a talk intercept utility for the X Window System.  A local
user can exploit this problem and execute arbitrary commands under the
GID utmp.  This could be used by an attacker to remove traces from the
utmp file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.11-9.1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xitalk package.</p>
