<p>iDEFENSE identified a vulnerability in the Opera web browser that
could be used by remote attackers to create or truncate arbitrary
files on the victims machine.  The KDE team discovered that a similar
<a href="http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20040517-1.txt">\
vulnerability</a> exists in KDE.</p>

<p>A remote attacker could entice a user to open a carefully crafted
telnet URI which may either create or truncate a file in the victims
home directory.  In KDE 3.2 and later versions the user is first
explicitly asked to confirm the opening of the telnet URI.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-13.woody.10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your KDE libraries.</p>
