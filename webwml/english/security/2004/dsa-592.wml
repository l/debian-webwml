<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a
format string vulnerability in ez-ipupdate, a client for many dynamic
DNS services.  This problem can only be exploited if ez-ipupdate is
running in daemon mode (most likely) with many but not all service
types.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11b5-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.11b8-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ez-ipupdate package.</p>
