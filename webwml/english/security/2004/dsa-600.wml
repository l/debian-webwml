<define-tag description>arbitrary file access</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in samba, a commonly used
LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.  A remote attacker
may be able to gain access to files which exist outside of the share's
defined path.  Such files must still be readable by the account used
for the connection, though.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3a-14.1.</p>

<p>In the unstable (sid) and testing (sarge) distributions this problem
was not present.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
