<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several problems have been discovered in MySQL, a commonly used SQL
database on Unix servers.  The following problems have been identified
by the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0835">CAN-2004-0835</a>

    <p>Oleksandr Byelkin noticed that ALTER TABLE ... RENAME checks
    CREATE/INSERT rights of the old table instead of the new one.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0836">CAN-2004-0836</a>

    <p>Lukasz Wojtow noticed a buffer overrun in the mysql_real_connect
    function.</p>
</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0837">CAN-2004-0837</a>

    <p>Dean Ellis noticed that multiple threads ALTERing the same (or
    different) MERGE tables to change the UNION can cause the server
    to crash or stall.</p>
</li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.21-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql and related packages and
restart services linking against them (e.g. Apache/PHP).</p>
