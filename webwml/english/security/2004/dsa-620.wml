<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Perl, the popular
scripting language.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0452">CAN-2004-0452</a>

    <p>Jeroen van Wolffelaar discovered that the rmtree() function in the
    File::Path module removes directory trees in an insecure manner
    which could lead to the removal of arbitrary files and directories
    through a symlink attack.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0976">CAN-2004-0976</a>

    <p>Trustix developers discovered several insecure uses of temporary
    files in many modules which allow a local attacker to overwrite
    files via a symlink attack.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.6.1-8.8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.8.4-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
