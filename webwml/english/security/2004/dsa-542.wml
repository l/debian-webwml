<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in recent versions of Qt, a
commonly used graphic widget set, used in KDE for example.  The first
problem allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, while the other
two only seem to pose a denial of service danger.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0691">CAN-2004-0691</a>:

    <p>Chris Evans has discovered a heap-based overflow when handling
    8-bit RLE encoded BMP files.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0692">CAN-2004-0692</a>:

    <p>Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the XPM
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0693">CAN-2004-0693</a>:

    <p>Marcus Meissner has discovered a crash condition in the GIF
    handling code, which is not yet fixed in Qt 3.3.</p>
</ul>
    
<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.3-20020329-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.3-4 of qt-x11-free.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qt packages.</p>
