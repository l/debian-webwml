escape from the FSP root directory (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-1022">CAN-2003-1022</a>), and also overflow
a fixed-length buffer to execute arbitrary code (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0011">CAN-2004-0011</a>).</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.81.b3-3.1woody1.</p>
