<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>More potential integer overflows have been found in the GD graphics
library which weren't covered by our security advisory DSA 591.  They
could be exploited by a specially crafted graphic and could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code on the victim's machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.1-10woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
