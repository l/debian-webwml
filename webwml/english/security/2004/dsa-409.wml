<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in BIND, a domain name server, whereby
a malicious name server could return authoritative negative responses
with a large TTL (time-to-live) value, thereby rendering a domain name
unreachable.  A successful attack would require that a vulnerable BIND
instance submit a query to a malicious nameserver. </p>

<p>The bind9 package is not affected by this vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1:8.3.3-2.0woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1:8.4.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your bind package.</p>
