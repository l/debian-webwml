<define-tag description>insufficient input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" discovered a problem in libtiff, the Tag Image File
Format library for processing TIFF graphics files.  Upon reading a
TIFF file it is possible to allocate a zero sized buffer and write to
it which would lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-6.woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages immediately.</p>
