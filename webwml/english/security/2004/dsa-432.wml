<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered a problem in
crawl, another console based dungeon exploration game, in the vein of
nethack and rogue.  The program uses several environment variables as
inputs but doesn't apply a size check before copying one of them into
a fixed size buffer.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.0beta23-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.0beta26-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your crawl package.</p>
