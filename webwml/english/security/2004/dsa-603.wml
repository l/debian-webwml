<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Trustix developers discovered insecure temporary file creation in a
supplemental script (der_chop) of the openssl package which may allow
local users to overwrite files via a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6c-2.woody.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7e-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl package.</p>
