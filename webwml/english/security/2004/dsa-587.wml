<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered a buffer overflow condition in the playlist
module of freeamp which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
Recent versions of freeamp were renamed into zinf.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.1.0-4woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem does not exist in the
zinf package as the code in question was rewritten.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeamp packages.</p>
