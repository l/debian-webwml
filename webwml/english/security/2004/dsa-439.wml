<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local root exploits have been discovered recently in the Linux
kernel.  This security advisory updates the PowerPC/Apus kernel for
Debian GNU/Linux.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems that are fixed with this update:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0961">CAN-2003-0961</a>:

   <p>An integer overflow in brk() system call (do_brk() function) for
   Linux allows a local attacker to gain root privileges.  Fixed
   upstream in Linux 2.4.23.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0985">CAN-2003-0985</a>:

   <p>Paul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in
   the Linux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may
   allow a local attacker to gain root privileges.  Version 2.2 is not
   affected by this bug.  Fixed upstream in Linux 2.4.24.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0077">CAN-2004-0077</a>:

   <p>Paul Starzetz and Wojciech Purczynski of isec.pl discovered a
   critical security vulnerability in the memory management code of
   Linux inside the mremap(2) system call.  Due to missing function
   return value check of internal functions a local attacker can gain
   root privileges.  Fixed upstream in Linux 2.4.25 and 2.6.3.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.26/20040204 of lart, netwinder and riscpc image and in
version 20040204 of kernel-patch-2.4.16-arm.</p>

<p>Other architectures will probably mentioned in a separate advisory or
are not affected (m68k).</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Linux kernel packages immediately.</p>
