<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A number of vulnerabilities have been discovered in XFree86.  The corrections
are listed below with the identification from the Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0083">CAN-2004-0083</a>:

    <p>Buffer overflow in ReadFontAlias from dirfile.c of
    XFree86 4.1.0 through 4.3.0 allows local users and remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code via a font alias file (font.alias) with a long
    token, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0084.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0084">CAN-2004-0084</a>:

    <p>Buffer overflow in the ReadFontAlias function in XFree86
    4.1.0 to 4.3.0, when using the CopyISOLatin1Lowered function, allows
    local or remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a
    malformed entry in the font alias (font.alias) file, a different
    vulnerability than CAN-2004-0083.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0106">CAN-2004-0106</a>:

    <p>Miscellaneous additional flaws in XFree86's handling of
    font files.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0690">CAN-2003-0690</a>:

    <p>xdm does not verify whether the pam_setcred function call
    succeeds, which may allow attackers to gain root privileges by
    triggering error conditions within PAM modules, as demonstrated in
    certain configurations of the MIT pam_krb5 module.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0093">CAN-2004-0093</a>, <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2004-0094">CAN-2004-0094</a>:

    <p>Denial-of-service attacks against the X
    server by clients using the GLX extension and Direct Rendering
    Infrastructure are possible due to unchecked client data (out-of-bounds
    array indexes [CAN-2004-0093] and integer signedness errors
    [CAN-2004-0094]).</p>

</ul>

<p>Exploitation of CAN-2004-0083, CAN-2004-0084, CAN-2004-0106,
CAN-2004-0093 and CAN-2004-0094 would require a connection to the X
server.  By default, display managers in Debian start the X server
with a configuration which only accepts local connections, but if the
configuration is changed to allow remote connections, or X servers are
started by other means, then these bugs could be exploited remotely.
Since the X server usually runs with root privileges, these bugs could
potentially be exploited to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>No attack vector for CAN-2003-0690 is known at this time.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.0-16woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.0-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xfree86 package.</p>
