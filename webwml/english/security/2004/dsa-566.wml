<p>An information leak has been detected in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, which may lead to the disclosure of sensitive
information, such as user names and passwords which are written into
log files.</p>

<p>The used patch only eliminates the authentication information in the
device URI which is logged in the error_log file.  It does not
eliminate the URI from the environment and process table, which is why
the CUPS developers recommend that system administrators do not code
authentication information in device URIs in the first place.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.20final+rc1-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS package.</p>
