<p>Faheem Mitha noticed that the iptables command, an administration tool
for IPv4 packet filtering and NAT, did not always load the required
modules on its own as it was supposed to.  This could lead to firewall
rules not being loaded on system startup.  This caused a failure in
connection with rules provided by lokkit at least.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.6a-5.0woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.11-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iptables package.</p>
