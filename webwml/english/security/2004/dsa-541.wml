<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Markus WÃ¶rle discovered a cross site scripting problem in
status-display (list.cgi) of the icecast internal webserver, an MPEG
layer III streaming server.  The UserAgent variable is not properly
html_escaped so that an attacker could cause the client to execute
arbitrary Java script commands.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.11-4.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.12-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icecast-server package.</p>
