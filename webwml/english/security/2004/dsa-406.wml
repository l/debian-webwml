<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in lftp, a set of
sophisticated command-line FTP/HTTP client programs.  An attacker
could create a carefully crafted directory on a website so that the
execution of an 'ls' or 'rels' command would lead to the execution of
arbitrary code on the client machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.9-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.10-1.</p>
