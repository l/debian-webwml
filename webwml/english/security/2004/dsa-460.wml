<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alan Cox discovered that the isag utility (which graphically displays
data collected by the sysstat tools), creates a temporary file without
taking proper precautions.  This vulnerability could allow a local
attacker to overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking
isag.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 5.0.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your sysstat package.</p>
