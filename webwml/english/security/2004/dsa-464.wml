<define-tag description>broken image handling</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Thomas Kristensen discovered a vulnerability in gdk-pixbuf (binary
package libgdk-pixbuf2), the GdkPixBuf image library for Gtk, that can
cause the surrounding application to crash.  To exploit this problem,
a remote attacker could send a carefully-crafted BMP file via mail,
which would cause e.g. Evolution to crash but is probably not limited
to Evolution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.0-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.22.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgdk-pixbuf2 package.</p>
