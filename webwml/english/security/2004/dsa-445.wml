<p>Ulf Härnhammar from the Debian Security Audit Project 
discovered a vulnerability in
lbreakout2, a game, where proper bounds checking was not performed on
environment variables.  This bug could be exploited by a local
attacker to gain the privileges of group "games".</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.2.2-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your lbreakout2 package.</p>
