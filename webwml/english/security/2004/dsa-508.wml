<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jaguar discovered a vulnerability in one component of xpcd, a PhotoCD
viewer.  xpcd-svga, part of xpcd which uses svgalib to display
graphics on the console, would copy user-supplied data of arbitrary
length into a fixed-size buffer in the pcd_open function.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.08-8woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xpcd package.</p>
