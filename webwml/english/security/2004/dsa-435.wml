<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in mpg123, a command-line mp3 player,
whereby a response from a remote HTTP server could overflow a buffer
allocated on the heap, potentially permitting execution of arbitrary
code with the privileges of the user invoking mpg123.  In order for
this vulnerability to be exploited, mpg321 would need to request an
mp3 stream from a malicious remote server via HTTP.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.59r-13woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.59r-15.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mpg123 package.</p>
