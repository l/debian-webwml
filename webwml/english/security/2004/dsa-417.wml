<define-tag description>missing boundary check</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Starzetz discovered a flaw in bounds checking in mremap() in the
Linux kernel (present in version 2.4.x and 2.6.x) which may allow a
local attacker to gain root privileges.  Version 2.2 is not affected
by this bug.</p>

<p>Andrew Morton discovered a missing boundary check for the brk system
call which can be used to craft a local root exploit.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.18-12 for the alpha architecture and in
version 2.4.18-1woody3 for the powerpc architecture.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon
with newly uploaded packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel packages.  These problems have
been fixed in the upstream version 2.4.24 as well.</p>
