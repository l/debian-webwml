<p>Trustix Security Engineers identified insecure temporary file creation
in a script included in the postgresql suite, an object-relational SQL
database.  This could lead an attacker to trick a user to overwrite
arbitrary files he has write access to.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.2.1-2woody6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.4.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql packages.</p>
