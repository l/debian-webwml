<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the shadow suite which provides
programs like chfn and chsh.  It is possible for a user, who is logged
in but has an expired password to alter his account information with
chfn or chsh without having to change the password.  The problem was
originally thought to be more severe.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 20000902-12woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.3-30.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your passwd package (from the shadow
suite).</p>
