<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>iDEFENSE discovered a buffer overflow in the wv library, used to
convert and preview Microsoft Word documents.  An attacker could
create a specially crafted document that could lead wvHtml to execute
arbitrary code on the victims machine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.1+rvt-2woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wv package.</p>
