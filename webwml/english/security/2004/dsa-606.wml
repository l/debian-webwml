<define-tag description>wrong signal handler</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>SGI has discovered that rpc.statd from the nfs-utils package, the
Network Status Monitor, did not ignore the "SIGPIPE".  Hence, a client
prematurely terminating the TCP connection could also terminate the
server process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nfs-utils package.</p>
