<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of the
SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method
for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.  The
library honors the environment variable SASL_PATH blindly, which
allows a local user to link against a malicious library to run
arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.27-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.28-6.2 of cyrus-sasl and in version 2.1.19-1.3 of
cyrus-sasl2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsasl packages.</p>
