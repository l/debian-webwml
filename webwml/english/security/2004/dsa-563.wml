<p>This advisory is an addition to DSA 563-1 and 563-2 which weren't able
to supersede the library on sparc and arm due to a different version
number for them in the stable archive. Other architectures were
updated properly. Another problem was reported in connection with
sendmail, though, which should be fixed with this update as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.27-3.1woody5.</p>

<p>For reference the advisory text follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the Cyrus implementation of the
SASL library, the Simple Authentication and Security Layer, a method
for adding authentication support to connection-based protocols.  The
library honors the environment variable SASL_PATH blindly, which
allows a local user to link against a malicious library to run
arbitrary code with the privileges of a setuid or setgid application.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.28-6.2 of cyrus-sasl and in version 2.1.19-1.3 of
cyrus-sasl2.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsasl packages.</p>
