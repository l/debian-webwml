<p>H.D. Moore discovered several terminal emulator security issues.  One
of them covers escape codes that are interepreted by the terminal
emulator.  This could be exploited by an attacker to insert malicious
commands hidden for the user, who has to hit enter to continue, which
would also execute the hidden commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.2-0pre2002042903.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version eterm-0.9.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eterm package.</p>
