<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An iDEFENSE security researcher discovered a buffer overflow in xpdf,
the portable document format (PDF) suite.  A maliciously crafted PDF
file could exploit this problem, resulting in the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.00-3.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.00-11.</p>
