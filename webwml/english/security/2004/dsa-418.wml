<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A bug was discovered in vbox3, a voice response system for isdn4linux,
whereby root privileges were not properly relinquished before
executing a user-supplied tcl script.  By exploiting this
vulnerability, a local user could gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.1.7.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution, this problem has been fixed in version 0.1.8.</p>
