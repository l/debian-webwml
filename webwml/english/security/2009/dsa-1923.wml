<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A denial of service vulnerability has been found in libhtml-parser-perl,
a collection of modules to parse HTML in text documents which is used by
several other projects like e.g. SpamAssassin.</p>

<p>Mark Martinec discovered that the decode_entities() function will get stuck
in an infinite loop when parsing certain HTML entities with invalid UTF-8
characters.  An attacker can use this to perform denial of service attacks
by submitting crafted HTML to an application using this functionality.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.55-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.56-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libhtml-parser-perl packages.</p>
