<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in imp4, a webmail component for
the horde framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4182">CVE-2008-4182</a>

<p>It was discovered that imp4 suffers from a cross-site scripting (XSS)
attack via the user field in an IMAP session, which allows attackers to
inject arbitrary HTML code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0930">CVE-2009-0930</a>

<p>It was discovered that imp4 is prone to several cross-site scripting
(XSS) attacks via several vectors in the mail code allowing attackers
to inject arbitrary HTML code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2-4, which was already included in the lenny release.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4.2-4.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imp4 packages.</p>
