<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Apr-util, the Apache Portable Runtime Utility library, is used by
Apache 2.x, Subversion, and other applications. Two denial of service
vulnerabilities have been found in apr-util:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>"kcope" discovered a flaw in the handling of internal XML entities in
the apr_xml_* interface that can be exploited to use all available
memory. This denial of service can be triggered remotely in the Apache
mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules. (No CVE id yet)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0023">CVE-2009-0023</a>
<p>Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in the
apr_strmatch_precompile function that can be exploited to cause a
daemon crash. The vulnerability can be triggered (1) remotely in
mod_dav_svn for Apache if the "SVNMasterURI" directive is in use, (2)
remotely in mod_apreq2 for Apache or other applications using
libapreq2, or (3) locally in Apache by a crafted ".htaccess" file.
</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Other exploit paths in other applications using apr-util may exist.</p>

<p>If you use Apache, or if you use svnserve in standalone mode, you need
to restart the services after you upgraded the libaprutil1 package.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.7+dfsg-2+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.12+dfsg-8+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apr-util packages.</p>
