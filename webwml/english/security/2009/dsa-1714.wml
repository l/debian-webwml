<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the "Probe Request" packet
parser of the Ralinktech wireless drivers might lead to remote denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Please note that you need to rebuild your driver from the source
package in order to set this update into effect. Detailed
instructions can be found in /usr/share/doc/rt2570-source/README.Debian</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0+cvs20060620-3+etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1.1.0+cvs20080623-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rt2570 package.</p>
