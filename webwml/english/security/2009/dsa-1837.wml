<p>It was discovered that the dbus_signature_validate function in
dbus, a simple interprocess messaging system, is prone to a denial of
service attack. This issue was caused by an incorrect fix for
DSA-1658-1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+etch3.</p>

<p>Packages for ia64 and s390 will be released once they are available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.14-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dbus packages.</p>
