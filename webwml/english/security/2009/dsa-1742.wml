<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Alan Rad Pop discovered that libsndfile, a library to read and write
sampled audio data, is prone to an integer overflow. This causes a
heap-based buffer overflow when processing crafted CAF description
chunks possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.16-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.17-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.19-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.</p>
