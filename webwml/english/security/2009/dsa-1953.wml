<p>Jan Lieskovsky discovered an error in expat, an XML parsing C library,
when parsing certain UTF-8 sequences, which can be exploited to crash an
application using the library.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.95.8-3.4+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be in version 2.0.1-6.</p>


<p>The builds for the mipsel architecture for the oldstable distribution
are not included yet. They will be released when they become available.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.</p>
