<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in APT, the well-known dpkg
frontend. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1300">CVE-2009-1300</a>

    <p>In time zones where daylight savings time occurs at midnight,
    the apt cron.daily script fails, stopping new security updates
    from being applied automatically.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1358">CVE-2009-1358</a>

    <p>A repository that has been signed with an expired or revoked
    OpenPGP key would still be considered valid by APT.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.46.4-0.1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.20.2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.21.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apt package.</p>
