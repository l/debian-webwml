<p>It was discovered that the Debian Mantis package, a web based bug
tracking system, installed the database credentials in a file with
world-readable permissions onto the local filesystem. This allows
local users to acquire the credentials used to control the Mantis
database.</p>

<p>This updated package corrects this problem for new installations and
will carefully try to update existing ones. Administrators can check
the permissions of the file /etc/mantis/config_db.php to see if they
are safe for their environment.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain a mantis package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6+dfsg-2lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.8+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.</p>
