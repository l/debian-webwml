<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in kvm, a full virtualization system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5714">CVE-2008-5714</a>

<p>Chris Webb discovered an off-by-one bug limiting KVM's VNC passwords to 7
characters. This flaw might make it easier for remote attackers to guess the VNC
password, which is limited to seven characters where eight was intended.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3290">CVE-2009-3290</a>

<p>It was discovered that the kvm_emulate_hypercall function in KVM does not
prevent access to MMU hypercalls from ring 0, which allows local guest OS users
to cause a denial of service (guest kernel crash) and read or write guest kernel
memory.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain kvm.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
72+dfsg-5~lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in version
85+dfsg-4.1</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvm packages.</p>
