<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that belpic, the belgian eID PKCS11 library, does not
properly check the result of an OpenSSL function for verifying
cryptographic signatures, which could be used to bypass the certificate
validation.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.9-7.etch.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0-6, which was already included in the lenny release.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.6.0-6.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your belpic packages.</p>
