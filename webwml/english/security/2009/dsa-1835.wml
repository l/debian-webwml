<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the library for the
Tag Image File Format (TIFF). The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2285">CVE-2009-2285</a>

   <p>It was discovered that malformed TIFF images can lead to a crash
   in the decompression code, resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2347">CVE-2009-2347</a>

   <p>Andrea Barisani discovered several integer overflows, which
   can lead to the execution of arbitrary code if malformed
   images are passed to the rgb2ycbcr or tiff2rgba tools.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.2-7+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.2-11.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages.</p>
