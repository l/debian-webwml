<p>Raphael Geissert discovered that uscan, a program to check for
availability of new source code versions which is part of the
devscripts package, runs Perl code downloaded from potentially
untrusted sources to implement its URL and version mangling
functionality.  This update addresses this issue by reimplementing the
relevant Perl operators without relying on the Perl interpreter,
trying to preserve backwards compatibility as much as possible.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.26etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10.35lenny6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.10.54.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your devscripts package.</p>
