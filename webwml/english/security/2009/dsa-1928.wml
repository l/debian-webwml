<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege
escalation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2846">CVE-2009-2846</a>

    <p>Michael Buesch noticed a typing issue in the eisa-eeprom driver
    for the hppa architecture. Local users could exploit this issue to
    gain access to restricted memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2847">CVE-2009-2847</a>

    <p>Ulrich Drepper noticed an issue in the do_sigalstack routine on
    64-bit systems. This issue allows local users to gain access to
    potentially sensitive memory on the kernel stack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2848">CVE-2009-2848</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet discovered an issue in the execve path, where the
    clear_child_tid variable was not being properly cleared. Local
    users could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service
    (memory corruption).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2849">CVE-2009-2849</a>

    <p>Neil Brown discovered an issue in the sysfs interface to md
    devices. When md arrays are not active, local users can exploit
    this vulnerability to cause a denial of service (oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2903">CVE-2009-2903</a>

    <p>Mark Smith discovered a memory leak in the appletalk
    implementation.  When the appletalk and ipddp modules are loaded,
    but no ipddp"N" device is found, remote attackers can cause a
    denial of service by consuming large amounts of system memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2908">CVE-2009-2908</a>

    <p>Loic Minier discovered an issue in the eCryptfs filesystem. A
    local user can cause a denial of service (kernel oops) by causing
    a dentry value to go negative.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2909">CVE-2009-2909</a>

    <p>Arjan van de Ven discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol
    implementation. A specially crafted call to setsockopt() can
    result in a denial of service (kernel oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2910">CVE-2009-2910</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered the existence of a sensitive kernel memory
    leak. Systems running the 'amd64' kernel do not properly sanitize
    registers for 32-bit processes.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3001">CVE-2009-3001</a>

    <p>Jiri Slaby fixed a sensitive memory leak issue in the ANSI/IEEE
    802.2 LLC implementation. This is not exploitable in the Debian
    lenny kernel as root privileges are required to exploit this
    issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3002">CVE-2009-3002</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet fixed several sensitive memory leaks in the IrDA,
    X.25 PLP (Rose), NET/ROM, Acorn Econet/AUN, and Controller Area
    Network (CAN) implementations. Local users can exploit these
    issues to gain access to kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3228">CVE-2009-3228</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet reported an instance of uninitialized kernel memory
    in the network packet scheduler. Local users may be able to
    exploit this issue to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.
  
<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3238">CVE-2009-3238</a>

    <p>Linus Torvalds provided a change to the get_random_int() function
    to increase its randomness.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3286">CVE-2009-3286</a>

    <p>Eric Paris discovered an issue with the NFSv4 server
    implementation.  When an O_EXCL create fails, files may be left
    with corrupted permissions, possibly granting unintentional
    privileges to other local users.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3547">CVE-2009-3547</a>

    <p>Earl Chew discovered a NULL pointer dereference issue in the
    pipe_rdwr_open function which can be used by local users to gain
    elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3612">CVE-2009-3612</a>

    <p>Jiri Pirko discovered a typo in the initialization of a structure
    in the netlink subsystem that may allow local users to gain access
    to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3613">CVE-2009-3613</a>

    <p>Alistair Strachan reported an issue in the r8169 driver. Remote
    users can cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and
    system crash) by transmitting a large amount of jumbo frames.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3620">CVE-2009-3620</a>

    <p>Ben Hutchings discovered an issue in the DRM manager for ATI Rage
    128 graphics adapters. Local users may be able to exploit this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3621">CVE-2009-3621</a>

    <p>Tomoki Sekiyama discovered a deadlock condition in the UNIX domain
    socket implementation. Local users can exploit this vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service (system hang).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.9etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
