<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that squid3, a high-performance proxy caching server for
web clients, is prone to several denial of service attacks.  Due to incorrect
bounds checking and insufficient validation while processing response and
request data an attacker is able to crash the squid daemon via crafted
requests or responses.</p>


<p>The squid package in the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected
by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.STABLE8-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
