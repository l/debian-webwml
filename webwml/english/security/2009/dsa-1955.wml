<p>It was discovered that network-manager-applet, a network management
framework, lacks some dbus restriction rules, which allows local users
to obtain sensitive information.</p>

<p>If you have locally modified the /etc/dbus-1/system.d/nm-applet.conf
file, then please make sure that you merge the changes from this fix
when asked during upgrade.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.4-6+etch1 of network-manager.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.6-4+lenny1 of network-manager-applet.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.7.0.99-1 of
network-manager-applet.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your network-manager and
network-manager-applet packages accordingly.</p>
