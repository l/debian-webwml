<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in cacti, a frontend to rrdtool
for monitoring systems and services. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3112">CVE-2007-3112</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-3113">CVE-2007-3113</a>

<p>It was discovered that cacti is prone to a denial of service via the
graph_height, graph_width, graph_start and graph_end parameters.
This issue only affects the oldstable (etch) version of cacti.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4032">CVE-2009-4032</a>

<p>It was discovered that cacti is prone to several cross-site scripting
attacks via different vectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4112">CVE-2009-4112</a>

<p>It has been discovered that cacti allows authenticated administrator
users to gain access to the host system by executing arbitrary commands
via the "Data Input Method" for the "Linux - Get Memory Usage" setting.</p>

<p>There is no fix for this issue at this stage. Upstream will implement a
whitelist policy to only allow certain "safe" commands. For the moment,
we recommend that such access is only given to trusted users and that
the options "Data Input" and "User Administration" are otherwise
deactivated.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.6i-3.6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7b-2.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.7e-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.</p>
