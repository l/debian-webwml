<define-tag description>missing escape function</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that mysql-ocaml, OCaml bindings for MySql, was
missing a function to call mysql_real_escape_string(). This is needed,
because mysql_real_escape_string() honours the charset of the connection
and prevents insufficient escaping, when certain multibyte character
encodings are used. The added function is called real_escape() and
takes the established database connection as a first argument. The old
escape_string() was kept for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Developers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to
use the new function.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-ocaml packages.</p>
