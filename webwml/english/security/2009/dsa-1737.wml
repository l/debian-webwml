<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several security issues have been discovered in wesnoth, a fantasy
turn-based strategy game. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0366">CVE-2009-0366</a>

<p>Daniel Franke discovered that the wesnoth server is prone to a denial of
service attack when receiving special crafted compressed data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0367">CVE-2009-0367</a>

<p>Daniel Franke discovered that the sandbox implementation for the python
AIs can be used to execute arbitrary python code on wesnoth clients. In
order to prevent this issue, the python support has been disabled. A
compatibility patch was included, so that the affected campagne is still
working properly.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.4.7-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth packages.</p>
