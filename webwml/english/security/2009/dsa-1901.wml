<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mediawiki1.7, a website engine
for collaborative work. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.1-9etch1 for mediawiki1.7, and mediawiki is not affected (it is a
metapackage for mediawiki1.7).</p>

<p>The stable (lenny) distribution does not include mediawiki1.7, and these
problems have been fixed in version 1:1.12.0-2lenny3 for mediawiki which was
already included in the lenny release.</p>

<p>The unstable (sid) and testing (squeeze) distributions do not
include mediawiki1.7, and these problems have been fixed in version 1:1.14.0-1
for mediawiki.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mediawiki1.7 packages.</p>
