<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libgd2, a library for
programmatic graphics creation and manipulation. The Common 
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-0455">CVE-2007-0455</a>

  <p>Kees Cook discovered a buffer overflow in libgd2's font renderer. An
  attacker could cause denial of service (application crash) and 
  possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted string with a JIS
  encoded font. This issue only affects the oldstable distribution
  (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3546">CVE-2009-3546</a>

  <p>Tomas Hoger discovered a boundary error in the "_gdGetColors()" 
  function. An attacker could conduct a buffer overflow or buffer 
  over-read attacks via a crafted GD file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.33-5.2etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution ion (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
