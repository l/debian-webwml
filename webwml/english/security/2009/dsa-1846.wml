<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matt T. Yourst discovered an issue in the kvm subsystem. Local
users with permission to manipulate /dev/kvm can cause a denial
of service (hang) by providing an invalid cr3 value to the
KVM_SET_SREGS call.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 72+dfsg-5~lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvm packages, and rebuild any kernel
modules you have built from a kvm-source package version.</p>
