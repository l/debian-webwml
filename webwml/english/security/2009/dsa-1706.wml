<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tobias Klein discovered that integer overflows in the code the Amarok
media player uses to parse Audible files may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-4etch1. Updated packages for sparc and arm will be
provided later.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.10-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your amarok packages.</p>
