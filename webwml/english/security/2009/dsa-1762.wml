<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that icu, the internal components for Unicode, did
not properly sanitise invalid encoded data, which could lead to crosssite scripting attacks.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.1-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6-2etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 4.0.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.</p>
