<p>It has been discovered that NTP, an implementation of the Network Time
Protocol, does not properly check the result of an OpenSSL function
for verifying cryptographic signatures, which may ultimately lead to
the acceptance of unauthenticated time information.  (Note that
cryptographic authentication of time servers is often not enabled in
the first place.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.2.p4+dfsg-2etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4p4+dfsg-8.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (lenny) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntp package.</p>
