<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Gerd v. Egidy discovered that the Pluto IKE daemon in strongswan, an
IPSec implementation for linux, is prone to a denial of service attack
via a malicious packet.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.0+dfsg-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
