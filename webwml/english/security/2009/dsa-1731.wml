<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Anders Kaseorg discovered that ndiswrapper suffers from buffer overflows
via specially crafted wireless network traffic, due to incorrectly
handling long ESSIDs. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.28-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.53-2, which was already included in the lenny release.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.53-2.</p>
