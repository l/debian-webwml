<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that BIND, an implementation of the DNS protocol
suite, does not properly check the result of an OpenSSL function which
is used to verify DSA cryptographic signatures.  As a result,
incorrect DNS resource records in zones protected by DNSSEC could be
accepted as genuine.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-2etch4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your BIND packages.</p>
