<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bas van Schaik discovered that WebSVN, a tool to view Subversion
repositories over the web, did not properly restrict access to private
repositories, allowing a remote attacker to read significant parts of
their content.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has also been fixed in
version 2.0-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your websvn package.</p>
