<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Two security issues have been discovered in ghostscript, the GPL
Ghostscript PostScript/PDF interpreter. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0583">CVE-2009-0583</a>

<p>Jan Lieskovsky discovered multiple integer overflows in the ICC library,
which allow the execution of arbitrary code via crafted ICC profiles in
PostScript files with embedded images.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0584">CVE-2009-0584</a>

<p>Jan Lieskovsky discovered insufficient upper-bounds checks on certain
variable sizes in the ICC library, which allow the execution of
arbitrary code via crafted ICC profiles in PostScript files with
embedded images.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.62.dfsg.1-3.2lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 8.54.dfsg.1-5etch2. Please note that the package in oldstable
is called gs-gpl.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript/gs-gpl packages.</p>
