<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ipplan, a web-based IP address manager and
tracker, does not sufficiently escape certain input parameters, which
allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.86a-7+lenny1.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain ipplan.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.91a-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ipplan packages.</p>
