<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several integer overflows, buffer overflows and memory allocation
errors were discovered in the Poppler PDF rendering library, which may
lead to denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code if a user
is tricked into opening a malformed PDF document.</p>

<p>An update for the old stable distribution (etch) will be issued soon as
version 0.4.5-5.1etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.7-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poppler packages.</p>
