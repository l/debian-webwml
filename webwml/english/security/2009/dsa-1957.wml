<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that aria2, a high speed download utility, is prone
to a buffer overflow in the DHT routing code, which might lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14.0-1+lenny1. Binaries for powerpc, arm, ia64 and hppa will
be provided once they are available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.2.0-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your aria2 packages.</p>
