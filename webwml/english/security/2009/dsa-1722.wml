<p>Derek Chan discovered that the PAM module for the Heimdal Kerberos
implementation allows reinitialisation of user credentials when run
from a setuid context, resulting in potential local denial of service
by overwriting the credential cache file or to local privilege
escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5-1etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been
fixed in version 3.10-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-heimdal package.</p>
