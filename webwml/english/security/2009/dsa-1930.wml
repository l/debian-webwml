<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in drupal6, a fully-featured
content management framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2372">CVE-2009-2372</a>

<p>Gerhard Killesreiter discovered a flaw in the way user signatures are
handled. It is possible for a user to inject arbitrary code via a
crafted user signature. (SA-CORE-2009-007)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2373">CVE-2009-2373</a>

<p>Mark Piper, Sven Herrmann and Brandon Knight discovered a cross-site
scripting issue in the forum module, which could be exploited via the
tid parameter. (SA-CORE-2009-007)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2374">CVE-2009-2374</a>

<p>Sumit Datta discovered that certain drupal6 pages leak sensitive
information such as user credentials. (SA-CORE-2009-007)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Several design flaws in the OpenID module have been fixed, which could
lead to cross-site request forgeries or privilege escalations. Also, the
file upload function does not process all extensions properly leading
to the possible execution of arbitrary code.
(SA-CORE-2009-008)</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain drupal6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.6-3lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 6.14-1.</p>
