<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An information disclosure flaw was found in mod_jk, the Tomcat Connector
module for Apache. If a buggy client included the "Content-Length" header
without providing request body data, or if a client sent repeated 
equests very quickly, one client could obtain a response intended for
another client.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.18-3etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.26-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:1.2.26-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.</p>
