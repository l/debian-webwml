<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matthew Dempsky discovered that Daniel J. Bernstein's djbdns, a Domain
Name System server, does not constrain offsets in the required manner,
which allows remote attackers with control over a third-party subdomain
served by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses containing
arbitrary records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain djbdns.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.05-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.05-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your djbdns package.</p>
