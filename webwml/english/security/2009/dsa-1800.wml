<define-tag description>denial of service/privilege escalation/sensitive memory leak</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, privilege escalation or a sensitive
memory leak. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0028">CVE-2009-0028</a>

    <p>Chris Evans discovered a situation in which a child process can
    send an arbitrary signal to its parent.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0834">CVE-2009-0834</a>

    <p>Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels that allows
    local users to circumvent system call audit configurations which
    filter based on the syscall numbers or argument details.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0835">CVE-2009-0835</a>

    <p>Roland McGrath discovered an issue on amd64 kernels with
    CONFIG_SECCOMP enabled. By making a specially crafted syscall,
    local users can bypass access restrictions.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0859">CVE-2009-0859</a>

    <p>Jiri Olsa discovered that a local user can cause a denial of
    service (system hang) using a SHM_INFO shmctl call on kernels
    compiled with CONFIG_SHMEM disabled. This issue does not affect
    prebuilt Debian kernels.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1046">CVE-2009-1046</a>

    <p>Mikulas Patocka reported an issue in the console subsystem that
    allows a local user to cause memory corruption by selecting a
    small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1072">CVE-2009-1072</a>

    <p>Igor Zhbanov reported that nfsd was not properly dropping
    CAP_MKNOD, allowing users to create device nodes on file systems
    exported with root_squash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1184">CVE-2009-1184</a>

    <p>Dan Carpenter reported a coding issue in the selinux subsystem
    that allows local users to bypass certain networking checks when
    running with compat_net=1.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1192">CVE-2009-1192</a>

    <p>Shaohua Li reported an issue in the AGP subsystem they may allow
    local users to read sensitive kernel memory due to a leak of
    uninitialized memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1242">CVE-2009-1242</a>

    <p>Benjamin Gilbert reported a local denial of service vulnerability
    in the KVM VMX implementation that allows local users to trigger
    an oops.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1265">CVE-2009-1265</a>

    <p>Thomas Pollet reported an overflow in the af_rose implementation
    that allows remote attackers to retrieve uninitialized kernel
    memory that may contain sensitive data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1337">CVE-2009-1337</a>

    <p>Oleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit_notify function that
    allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by
    running a program that modifies the exit_signal field and then
    uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1338">CVE-2009-1338</a>

    <p>Daniel Hokka Zakrisson discovered that a kill(-1) is permitted to
    reach processes outside of the current process namespace.</p></li>
   
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1439">CVE-2009-1439</a>

    <p>Pavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that
    allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long
    nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where applicable,
will be fixed in future updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-15lenny2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
