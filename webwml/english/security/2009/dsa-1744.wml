<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Sebastien Helleu discovered that an error in the handling of color codes
in the weechat IRC client could cause an out-of-bounds read of an internal
color array. This can be used by an attacker to crash user clients
via a crafted PRIVMSG command.</p>


<p>The weechat version in the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected
by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.6-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.6.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your weechat packages.</p>
