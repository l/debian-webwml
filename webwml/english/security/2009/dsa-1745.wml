<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several security issues have been discovered in lcms, a color management
library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0581">CVE-2009-0581</a>

<p>Chris Evans discovered that lcms is affected by a memory leak, which
could result in a denial of service via specially crafted image files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0723">CVE-2009-0723</a>

<p>Chris Evans discovered that lcms is prone to several integer overflows
via specially crafted image files, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0733">CVE-2009-0733</a>

<p>Chris Evans discovered the lack of upper-bounds check on sizes leading
to a buffer overflow, which could be used to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.17.dfsg-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.15-1.1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lcms packages.</p>
