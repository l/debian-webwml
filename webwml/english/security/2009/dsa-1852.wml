<define-tag description>insufficient input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that fetchmail, a full-featured remote mail retrieval
and forwarding utility, is vulnerable to the "Null Prefix Attacks Against
SSL/TLS Certificates" recently published at the Blackhat conference.
This allows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks
via a crafted ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the
subjectAltName or Common Name fields.</p>

<p>Note, as a fetchmail user you should always use strict certificate
validation through either these option combinations:
    sslcertck ssl sslproto ssl3    (for service on SSL-wrapped ports)
or
    sslcertck sslproto tls1        (for STARTTLS-based services)</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.6-1etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.9~rc2-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.9~rc2-6.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail packages.</p>
