<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that znc, an IRC proxy/bouncer, does not properly
sanitize input contained in configuration change requests to the
webadmin interface.  This allows authenticated users to elevate their
privileges and indirectly execute arbitrary commands (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0759">CVE-2009-0759</a>).</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.045-3+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.058-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.066-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your znc packages.</p>
