<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Marek Grzybowski discovered that changetrack, a program to monitor
changes to (configuration) files, is prone to shell command injection
via metacharacters in filenames. The behaviour of the program has been
adjusted to reject all filenames with metacharacters.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3-3+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.3-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your changetrack packages.</p>
