network traffic analyzer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
code or denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1268">CVE-2009-1268</a>
was fixed for Etch.  Since this security update was issued prior to the release
