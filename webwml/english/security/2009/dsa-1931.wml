<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the NetScape Portable
Runtime Library, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The 
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following 
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1563">CVE-2009-1563</a>

    <p>A programming error in the string handling code may lead to the
    execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2463">CVE-2009-2463</a>

    <p>An integer overflow in the Base64 decoding functions may lead to
    the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nspr.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.1-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your NSPR packages.</p>
