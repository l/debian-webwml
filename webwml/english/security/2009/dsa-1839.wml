<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It has been discovered that gst-plugins-good0.10, the GStreamer plugins
from the "good" set, are prone to an integer overflow, when processing
a large PNG file. This could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.8-4.1~lenny2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.4-4+etch1.</p>

<p>Packages for the s390 and hppa architectures will be released once they
are available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 0.10.15-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gst-plugins-good0.10 packages.</p>
