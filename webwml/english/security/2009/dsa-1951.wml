<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that firefox-sage, a lightweight RSS and Atom feed
reader for Firefox, does not sanitise the RSS feed information
correctly, which makes it prone to a cross-site scripting and a
cross-domain scripting attack.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-0.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.3-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firefox-sage packages.</p>
