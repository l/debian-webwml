<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ronald Volgers discovered that memcached, a high-performance memory object
caching system, is vulnerable to several heap-based buffer overflows due
to integer conversions when parsing certain length attributes. An
attacker can use this to execute arbitrary code on the system running
memcached (on etch with root privileges).</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.12-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution , this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your memcached packages.</p>
