<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in drupal, a web content
management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

    <li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1575">CVE-2009-1575</a>
    <p>pod.Edge discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability due that can be
    triggered when some browsers interpret UTF-8 strings as UTF-7 if they
    appear before the generated HTML document defines its Content-Type.
    This allows a malicious user to execute arbitrary javascript in the
    context of the web site if they're allowed to post content.</p></li>

    <li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1576">CVE-2009-1576</a>
    <p>Moritz Naumann discovered an information disclosure vulnerability. If
    a user is tricked into visiting the site via a specially crafted URL
    and then submits a form (such as the search box) from that page, the
    information in their form submission may be directed to a third-party
    site determined by the URL and thus disclosed to the third party. The
    third party site may then execute a cross-site request forgery attack
    against the submitted form.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain drupal and is not
affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
6.6-3lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.11-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal6 package.</p>
