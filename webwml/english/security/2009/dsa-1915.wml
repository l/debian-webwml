<p>Notice: Debian 5.0.4, the next point release of Debian 'lenny',
will include a new default value for the mmap_min_addr tunable.
This change will add an additional safeguard against a class of security
vulnerabilities known as "NULL pointer dereference" vulnerabilities, but
it will need to be overridden when using certain applications.
Additional information about this change, including instructions for
making this change locally in advance of 5.0.4 (recommended), can be
found at: <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/mmap_min_addr">http://wiki.debian.org/mmap_min_addr</a>.</p>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege escalation.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2695">CVE-2009-2695</a>

    <p>Eric Paris provided several fixes to increase the protection
    provided by the mmap_min_addr tunable against NULL pointer
    dereference vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2903">CVE-2009-2903</a>

    <p>Mark Smith discovered a memory leak in the appletalk
    implementation.  When the appletalk and ipddp modules are loaded,
    but no ipddp"N" device is found, remote attackers can cause a
    denial of service by consuming large amounts of system memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2908">CVE-2009-2908</a>

    <p>Loic Minier discovered an issue in the eCryptfs filesystem. A
    local user can cause a denial of service (kernel oops) by causing
    a dentry value to go negative.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2909">CVE-2009-2909</a>

    <p>Arjan van de Ven discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol
    implementation. A specially crafted call to setsockopt() can
    result in a denial of service (kernel oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2910">CVE-2009-2910</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered the existence of a sensitive kernel memory
    leak. Systems running the 'amd64' kernel do not properly sanitize
    registers for 32-bit processes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3001">CVE-2009-3001</a>

    <p>Jiri Slaby fixed a sensitive memory leak issue in the ANSI/IEEE
    802.2 LLC implementation. This is not exploitable in the Debian
    lenny kernel as root privileges are required to exploit this
    issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3002">CVE-2009-3002</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet fixed several sensitive memory leaks in the IrDA,
    X.25 PLP (Rose), NET/ROM, Acorn Econet/AUN, and Controller Area
    Network (CAN) implementations. Local users can exploit these
    issues to gain access to kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3286">CVE-2009-3286</a>

    <p>Eric Paris discovered an issue with the NFSv4 server
    implementation.  When an O_EXCL create fails, files may be left
    with corrupted permissions, possibly granting unintentional
    privileges to other local users.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3290">CVE-2009-3290</a>

    <p>Jan Kiszka noticed that the kvm_emulate_hypercall function in KVM
    does not prevent access to MMU hypercalls from ring 0, which
    allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest
    kernel crash) and read or write guest kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3613">CVE-2009-3613</a>

    <p>Alistair Strachan reported an issue in the r8169 driver. Remote
    users can cause a denial of service (IOMMU space exhaustion and
    system crash) by transmitting a large amount of jumbo frames.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-19lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
