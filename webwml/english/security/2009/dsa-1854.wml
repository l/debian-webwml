<define-tag description>heap buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matt Lewis discovered that the memory management code in the Apache
Portable Runtime (APR) library does not guard against a wrap-around
during size computations.  This could cause the library to return a
memory area which smaller than requested, resulting a heap overflow
and possibly arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-9 of the apr package, and version 1.2.7+dfsg-2+etch3 of
the apr-util package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-5+lenny1 of the apr package and version 1.2.12-5+lenny1
of the apr-util package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your APR packages.</p>
