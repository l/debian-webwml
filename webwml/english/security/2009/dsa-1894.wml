<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Miroslav Lichvar discovered that newt, a windowing toolkit, is prone to
a buffer overflow in the content processing code, which can lead to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.52.2-10+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.52.2-11.3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your newt packages.</p>
