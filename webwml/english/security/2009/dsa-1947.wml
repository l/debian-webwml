<p>Matt Elder discovered that Shibboleth, a federated web single sign-on
system is vulnerable to script injection through redirection URLs. More
details can be found in the Shibboleth advisory at
<a href="http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/secadv/secadv_20091104.txt">http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/secadv/secadv_20091104.txt</a>.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3f.dfsg1-2+etch2 of shibboleth-sp.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1.dfsg1-3+lenny2 of shibboleth-sp, version 2.0.dfsg1-4+lenny2
of shibboleth-sp2 and version 2.0-2+lenny2 of opensaml2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3+dfsg-1 of shibboleth-sp2, version 2.3-1 of opensaml2 and
version 1.3.1-1 of xmltooling.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Shibboleth packages.</p>
