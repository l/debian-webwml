<p>It was discovered that the BIND DNS server terminates when processing a
specially crafted dynamic DNS update.  This vulnerability affects all
BIND servers which serve at least one DNS zone authoritatively, as a
master, even if dynamic updates are not enabled.  The default Debian
configuration for resolvers includes several authoritative zones, too,
so resolvers are also affected by this issue unless these zones have
been removed.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-2etch5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.5.1.dfsg.P3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.6.1.dfsg.P1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
