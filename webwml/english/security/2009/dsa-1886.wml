<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Iceweasel web
browser, an unbranded version of the Firefox browser. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3079">CVE-2009-3079</a>

   <p>"moz_bug_r_a4" discovered that a programming error in the FeedWriter
   module could lead to the execution of Javascript code with elevated

   <p>Prateek Saxena discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability in
   the MozSearch plugin interface.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.6-3.</p>

<p>As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported browser.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.0.14-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
