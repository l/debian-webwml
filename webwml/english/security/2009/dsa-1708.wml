<define-tag description>shell command injection</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that gitweb, the web interface for the Git version
control system, contained several vulnerabilities:</p>

<p>Remote attackers could use crafted requests to execute shell commands on
the web server, using the snapshot generation and pickaxe search
functionality (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5916">CVE-2008-5916</a>).</p>

<p>Local users with write access to the configuration of a Git repository
served by gitweb could cause gitweb to execute arbitrary shell commands
with the permission of the web server (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5516">CVE-2008-5516</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5517">CVE-2008-5517</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4.4-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and testing distribution (lenny),
the remote shell command injection issue (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5516">CVE-2008-5516</a>) has been fixed
in version 1.5.6-1.  The other issue will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Git packages.</p>
