<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the "Probe Request"
packet parser of the Ralinktech wireless drivers might lead to
remote denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

package in order to set this update into effect. Detailed
instructions can be found in /usr/share/doc/rt2500-source/README.Debian</p>

version 1.1.0+cvs20060620-3+etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.1.0-b4+cvs20080623-3.</p>
