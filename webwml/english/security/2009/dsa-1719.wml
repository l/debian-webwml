<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Martin von Gagern discovered that GNUTLS, an implementation of the
TLS/SSL protocol, handles verification of X.509 certificate chains
incorrectly if a self-signed certificate is configured as a trusted
certificate.  This could cause clients to accept forged server
certificates as genuine.  (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-4989">CVE-2008-4989</a>)</p>

<p>In addition, this update tightens the checks for X.509v1 certificates
which causes GNUTLS to reject certain certificate chains it accepted
before.  (In certificate chain processing, GNUTLS does not recognize
X.509v1 certificates as valid unless explicitly requested by the
application.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-3+etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-3 of the gnutls26 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls13 packages.</p>
