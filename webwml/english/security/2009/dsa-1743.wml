<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two buffer overflows have been found in the GIF image parsing code of
Tk, a cross-platform graphical toolkit, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5137">CVE-2007-5137</a>

<p>It was discovered that libtk-img is prone to a buffer overflow via
specially crafted multi-frame interlaced GIF files.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2007-5378">CVE-2007-5378</a>

<p>It was discovered that libtk-img is prone to a buffer overflow via
specially crafted GIF files with certain subimage sizes.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3-release-7+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3-15etch3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.3-release-8.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtk-img packages.</p>
