<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Michael Brooks discovered that ctorrent, a text-mode bittorrent client,
does not verify the length of file paths in torrent files.  An attacker
can exploit this via a crafted torrent that contains a long file path to
execute arbitrary code with the rights of the user opening the file.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain ctorrent.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.4-dnh3.2-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.4-dnh3.2-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ctorrent packages.</p>
