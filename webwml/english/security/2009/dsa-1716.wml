<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that xvnc4viewer, a virtual network computing client
software for X, is prone to an integer overflow via a malicious
encoding value that could lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1+X4.3.0-21+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable (sid) distribution this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1+X4.3.0-31.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) distribution this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vnc4 packages.</p>
