<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The security update for proftpd-dfsg in DSA-1727-1 caused a regression
with the postgresql backend. This update corrects the flaw. Also it was
discovered that the oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by the
security issues. For reference the original advisory follows.</p>


<p>Two SQL injection vulnerabilities have been found in proftpd, a
virtual-hosting FTP daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0542">CVE-2009-0542</a>

	<p>Shino discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability
	via the use of certain characters in the username.</p></li>


	<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0543">CVE-2009-0543</a>

	<p>TJ Saunders discovered that proftpd is prone to an SQL injection
	vulnerability due to insufficient escaping mechanisms, when multybite
	character encodings are used.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.</p>
