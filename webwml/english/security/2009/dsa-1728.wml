<p>It was discovered that dkim-milter, an implementation of the DomainKeys
Identified Mail protocol, may crash during DKIM verification if it
encounters a specially-crafted or revoked public key record in DNS.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain dkim-milter packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0.dfsg-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.0.dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dkim-milter packages.</p>
