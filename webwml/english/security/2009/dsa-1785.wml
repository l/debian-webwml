<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Wireshark
network traffic analyzer, which may lead to denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1210">CVE-2009-1210</a>

    <p>A format string vulnerability was discovered in the PROFINET
    dissector.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1268">CVE-2009-1268</a>

    <p>The dissector for the Check Point High-Availability Protocol
    could be forced to crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1269">CVE-2009-1269</a>

    <p>Malformed Tektronix files could lead to a crash.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch), is only affected by the
CPHAP crash, which doesn't warrant an update on its own. The fix
will be queued up for an upcoming security update or a point release.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-3+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wireshark packages.</p>
