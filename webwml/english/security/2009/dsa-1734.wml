<p>b.badrignans discovered that OpenSC, a set of smart card utilities,
could stores private data on a smart card without proper access
restrictions.</p>

<p>Only blank cards initialised with OpenSC are affected by this problem.
This update only improves creating new private data objects, but cards
already initialised with such private data objects need to be
modified to repair the access control conditions on such cards.
Instructions for a variety of situations can be found at the OpenSC
web site: http://www.opensc-project.org/security.html</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.11.4-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem wil be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your opensc package and recreate any
private data objects stored on your smart cards.</p>
