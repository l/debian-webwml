<p>Several vulnerabilities have been identified in xpdf, a suite of tools
for viewing and converting Portable Document Format (PDF) files.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0146">CVE-2009-0146</a>

    <p>Multiple buffer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and
    earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and other products allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file,
    related to (1) JBIG2SymbolDict::setBitmap and (2)
    JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0147">CVE-2009-0147</a>

    <p>Multiple integer overflows in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and
    earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, and other products allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file,
    related to (1) JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, (2)
    JBIG2Stream::readSymbolDictSeg, and (3) JBIG2Stream::readGenericBitmap.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0165">CVE-2009-0165</a>

    <p>Integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, as
    used in Poppler and other products, when running on Mac OS X, has
    unspecified impact, related to "g*allocn."</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0166">CVE-2009-0166</a>

    <p>The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and
    earlier, and other products allows remote attackers to cause a denial
    of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free of
    uninitialized memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0799">CVE-2009-0799</a>

    <p>The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
    Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers
    an out-of-bounds read.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0800">CVE-2009-0800</a>

    <p>Multiple "input validation flaws" in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2
    and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other
    products allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    PDF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1179">CVE-2009-1179</a>

    <p>Integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS
    1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1180">CVE-2009-1180</a>

    <p>The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
    Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that triggers a free of
    invalid data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1181">CVE-2009-1181</a>

    <p>The JBIG2 decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier,
    Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PDF file that triggers a
    NULL pointer dereference.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1182">CVE-2009-1182</a>

    <p>Multiple buffer overflows in the JBIG2 MMR decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and
    earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other
    products allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted
    PDF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1183">CVE-2009-1183</a>

    <p>The JBIG2 MMR decoder in Xpdf 3.02pl2 and earlier, CUPS 1.3.9 and
    earlier, Poppler before 0.10.6, and other products allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and hang) via a
    crafted PDF file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
3.01-9.1+etch6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
3.02-1.4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed in a
forthcoming version.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf packages.</p>
