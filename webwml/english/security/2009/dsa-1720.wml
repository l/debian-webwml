<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TYPO3 web
content management framework.</p>

<p>Marcus Krause and Michael Stucki from the TYPO3 security team
discovered that the jumpUrl mechanism discloses secret hashes enabling
a remote attacker to bypass access control by submitting the correct
value as a URL parameter and thus being able to read the content of
arbitrary files.</p>

<p>Jelmer de Hen and Dmitry Dulepov discovered multiple cross-site
scripting vulnerabilities in the backend user interface allowing
remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p>

<p>As it is very likely that your encryption key has been exposed we
strongly recommend to change your encryption key via the install tool
after installing the update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2+debian-8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typo3 package.</p>
