<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the TFTP
component of dnsmasq.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2957">CVE-2009-2957</a>
  A buffer overflow in TFTP processing may enable arbitrary code
  execution to attackers which are permitted to use the TFTP service.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2958">CVE-2009-2958</a>
  Malicious TFTP clients may crash dnsmasq, leading to denial of
  service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.45-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.50-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.</p>
