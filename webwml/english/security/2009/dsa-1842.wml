<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenEXR image
library, which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1720">CVE-2009-1720</a>

   <p>Drew Yao discovered integer overflows in the preview and
   compression code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1721">CVE-2009-1721</a>

   <p>Drew Yao discovered that an uninitialised pointer could be freed
   in the decompression code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1722">CVE-2009-1722</a>

   <p>A buffer overflow was discovered in the compression code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.2-4.3+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openexr packages.</p>
