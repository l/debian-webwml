<p>Two security issues have been discovered in kdegraphics, the graphics
apps from the official KDE release. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0945">CVE-2009-0945</a>
<p>It was discovered that the KSVG animation element implementation suffers
from a null pointer dereference flaw, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1709">CVE-2009-1709</a>
<p>It was discovered that the KSVG animation element implementation is
prone to a use-after-free flaw, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4:3.5.5-3etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:3.5.9-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 4:4.0.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdegraphics packages.</p>
