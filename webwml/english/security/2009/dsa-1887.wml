<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Brian Mastenbrook discovered that rails, the MVC ruby based framework
geared for web application development, is prone to cross-site scripting
attacks via malformed strings in the form helper.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch) security support has been
discontinued. It has been reported that rails in oldstable is unusable
and several features that are affected by security issues are broken due
to programming issues. It is highly recommended to upgrade to the
version in stable (lenny).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0-7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.2.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.</p>
