<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remotely exploitable vulnerabilities have been discovered in the
TYPO3 web content management framework.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0255">CVE-2009-0255</a>
    <p>Chris John Riley discovered that the TYPO3-wide used encryption key is
    generated with an insufficiently random seed resulting in low entropy
    which makes it easier for attackers to crack this key.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0256">CVE-2009-0256</a>
    <p>Marcus Krause discovered that TYPO3 is not invalidating a supplied session
    on authentication which allows an attacker to take over a victims
    session via a session fixation attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0257">CVE-2009-0257</a>
    <p>Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to
    inject arbitrary web script or HTML via various arguments and user supplied
    strings used in the indexed search system extension, adodb extension test
    scripts or the workspace module.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0258">CVE-2009-0258</a>
    <p>Mads Olesen discovered a remote command injection vulnerability in
    the indexed search system extension which allows attackers to
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted file name which is passed
    unescaped to various system tools that extract file content for
    the indexing.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>Because of <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0255">CVE-2009-0255</a>, please make sure that besides installing
this update, you also create a new encryption key after the
installation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.2+debian-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your TYPO3 packages.</p>
