<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Leigh James discovered that nss-ldapd, an NSS module for using
LDAP as a naming service, by default creates the configuration file
/etc/nss-ldapd.conf world-readable which could leak the configured
LDAP password if one is used for connecting to the LDAP server.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss-ldapd.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.7.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss-ldapd package.</p>
