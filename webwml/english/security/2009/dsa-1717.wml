<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Cornelius discovered a buffer overflow in devil, a cross-platform
image loading and manipulation toolkit, which could be triggered via a
crafted Radiance RGBE file. This could potentially lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.7-5+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8-rc2-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.5-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your devil package.</p>
