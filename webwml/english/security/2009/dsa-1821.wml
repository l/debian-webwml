<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Sam Hocevar discovered that amule, a client for the eD2k and Kad
networks, does not properly sanitise the filename, when using the
preview function. This could lead to the injection of arbitrary commands
passed to the video player.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.5-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your amule packages.</p>
