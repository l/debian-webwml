<p>A design flaw has been found in the TLS and SSL protocol that allows
an attacker to inject arbitrary content at the beginning of a TLS/SSL
connection. The attack is related to the way how TLS and SSL handle
session renegotiations. <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</a> has been assigned to this
vulnerability.</p>

<p>As a partial mitigation against this attack, this apache2 update
disables client-initiated renegotiations. This should fix the
vulnerability for the majority of Apache configurations in use.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is not a complete fix for the problem. The attack is
still possible in configurations where the server initiates the
renegotiation. This is the case for the following configurations
(the information in the changelog of the updated packages is
slightly inaccurate):</p>

<ul>
<li>The "SSLVerifyClient" directive is used in a Directory or Location context.</li>
<li>The "SSLCipherSuite" directive is used in a Directory or Location context.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a workaround, you may rearrange your configuration in a way that
SSLVerifyClient and SSLCipherSuite are only used on the server or
virtual host level.</p>

<p>A complete fix for the problem will require a protocol change. Further
information will be included in a separate announcement about this
issue.</p>


<p>In addition, this update fixes the following issues in Apache's
mod_proxy_ftp:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3094">CVE-2009-3094</a>
<p>Insufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp module allowed remote FTP
servers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and child
process crash) via a malformed reply to an EPSV command.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3095">CVE-2009-3095</a>
<p>Insufficient input validation in the mod_proxy_ftp module allowed remote
authenticated attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and send
arbitrary FTP commands to an FTP server.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-4+etch11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.9-10+lenny6. This version also includes some non-security
bug fixes that were scheduled for inclusion in the next stable point
release (Debian 5.0.4).</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed in version 2.2.14-2.</p>

<p>This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which
have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages.</p>

<p>Updated apache2-mpm-itk packages for the armel architecture are not
included yet. They will be released as soon as they become available.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 and apache2-mpm-itk packages.</p>
