<p>Paul Szabo discovered that login, the system login tool, did not
correctly handle symlinks while setting up tty permissions. If a local
attacker were able to gain control of the system utmp file, they could
cause login to change the ownership and permissions on arbitrary files,
leading to a root privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.18.1-7+etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your shadow package.</p>
