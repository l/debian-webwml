<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in graphicsmagick, a
collection of image processing tool, which can lead to the execution
of arbitrary code, exposure of sensitive information or cause DoS.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1667">CVE-2007-1667</a>

  <p>Multiple integer overflows in XInitImage function in xwd.c for
  GraphicsMagick, allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a
  denial of service (crash) or obtain sensitive information via
  crafted images with large or negative values that trigger a
  buffer overflow. It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1797">CVE-2007-1797</a>

  <p>Multiple integer overflows allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted DCM image, or the colors or comments field in a
  crafted XWD image. It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4985">CVE-2007-4985</a>

  <p>A crafted image file can trigger an infinite loop in the ReadDCMImage
  function or in the ReadXCFImage function. It only affects the oldstable
  distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4986">CVE-2007-4986</a>

  <p>Multiple integer overflows allow context-dependent attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted .dcm, .dib, .xbm, .xcf, or .xwd image file,
  which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It only affects the
  oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4988">CVE-2007-4988</a>

  <p>A sign extension error allows context-dependent attackers to execute
  arbitrary code via a crafted width value in an image file, which
  triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow. It
  affects only the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1096">CVE-2008-1096</a>

  <p>The load_tile function in the XCF coder allows user-assisted remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted .xcf file that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write.
  It affects only oldstable (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3134">CVE-2008-3134</a>

  <p>Multiple vulnerabilities in GraphicsMagick before 1.2.4 allow remote
  attackers to cause a denial of service (crash, infinite loop, or
  memory consumption) via vectors in the AVI, AVS, DCM, EPT, FITS,
  MTV,  PALM, RLA, and TGA decoder readers; and the
  GetImageCharacteristics function in magick/image.c, as reachable
  from a crafted PNG, JPEG, BMP, or TIFF file.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-6070">CVE-2008-6070</a>

  <p>Multiple heap-based buffer underflows in the ReadPALMImage function in
  coders/palm.c in GraphicsMagick before 1.2.3 allow remote attackers
  to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
  code via a crafted PALM image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-6071">CVE-2008-6071</a>

  <p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the DecodeImage function in
  coders/pict.c in GraphicsMagick before 1.1.14, and 1.2.x before
  1.2.3, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
  or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-6072">CVE-2008-6072</a>

  <p>Multiple vulnerabilities in GraphicsMagick allow remote attackers to
  cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors in XCF and CINEON images.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-6621">CVE-2008-6621</a>

  <p>Vulnerability in GraphicsMagick allows remote attackers to cause a denial
  of service (crash) via vectors in DPX images.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1882">CVE-2009-1882</a>

  <p>Integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
  (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file,
  which triggers a buffer overflow.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.7-13+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.11-3.2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
1.3.5-5.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your graphicsmagick packages.</p>
