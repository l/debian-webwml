<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Will Drewry discovered that pango, a system for layout and rendering of
internationalized text, is prone to an integer overflow via long
glyphstrings. This could cause the execution of arbitrary code when
displaying crafted data through an application using the pango library.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14.8-5+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.20.5-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.24-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pango1.0 packages.</p>
