<define-tag description>null ptr dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Anibal Sacco discovered that cups, a general printing system for UNIX
systems, suffers from null pointer dereference because of its handling
of two consecutive IPP packets with certain tag attributes that are
treated as IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags. This allows unauthenticated attackers
to perform denial of service attacks by crashing the cups daemon.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4+etch8 of cupsys.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.8-1+lenny6 of cups.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups/cupsys packages.</p>
