<p>It was discovered that php-net-ping, a PHP PEAR module to execute ping
independently of the Operating System, performs insufficient input
sanitising, which might be used to inject arguments (no CVE yet) or
execute arbitrary commands (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4024">CVE-2009-4024</a>) on a system that uses
php-net-ping.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php-net-ping packages.</p>
