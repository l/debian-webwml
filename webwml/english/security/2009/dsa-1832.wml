<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tielei Wang discovered that CamlImages, an open source image processing
library, suffers from several integer overflows which may lead to a
potentially exploitable heap overflow and result in arbitrary code
execution.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.20-8+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.1-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your camlimages package.</p>
