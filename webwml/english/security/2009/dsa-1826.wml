<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in eggdrop, an advanced IRC
robot. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2807">CVE-2007-2807</a>

<p>It was discovered that eggdrop is vulnerable to a buffer overflow, which
could result in a remote user executing arbitrary code. The previous DSA
(DSA-1448-1) did not fix the issue correctly.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1789">CVE-2009-1789</a>

<p>It was discovered that eggdrop is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack, that allows remote attackers to cause a crash via a crafted
PRIVMSG.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.19-1.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.18-1etch2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.19-1.2</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eggdrop package.</p>
