<define-tag description>buffer underflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Ries discovered that nginx, a high-performance HTTP server, reverse
proxy and IMAP/POP3 proxy server, is vulnerable to a buffer underflow when
processing certain HTTP requests.  An attacker can use this to execute
arbitrary code with the rights of the worker process (www-data on Debian)
or possibly perform denial of service attacks by repeatedly crashing
worker processes via a specially crafted URL in an HTTP request.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.13-2+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.32-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.61-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx packages.</p>
