<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in SquirrelMail,
a webmail application. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1578">CVE-2009-1578</a>

    <p>Cross site scripting was possible through a number of pages which
    allowed an attacker to steal sensitive session data.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1579">CVE-2009-1579</a>,
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1381">CVE-2009-1381</a>

    <p>Code injection was possible when SquirrelMail was configured to
    use the map_yp_alias function to authenticate users. This is not
    the default.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1580">CVE-2009-1580</a>

    <p>It was possible to hijack an active user session by planting a
    specially crafted cookie into the user's browser.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1581">CVE-2009-1581</a>

    <p>Specially crafted HTML emails could use the CSS positioning feature
    to place email content over the SquirrelMail user interface, allowing
    for phishing.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.9a-5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.15-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.19-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
