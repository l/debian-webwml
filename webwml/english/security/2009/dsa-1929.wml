<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege
escalation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1883">CVE-2009-1883</a>

    <p>Solar Designer discovered a missing capability check in the
    z90crypt driver or s390 systems. This vulnerability may allow
    a local user to gain elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2909">CVE-2009-2909</a>

    <p>Arjan van de Ven discovered an issue in the AX.25 protocol
    implementation. A specially crafted call to setsockopt() can
    result in a denial of service (kernel oops).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3001">CVE-2009-3001</a>

    <p>Jiri Slaby fixed a sensitive memory leak issue in the ANSI/IEEE
    802.2 LLC implementation. This is not exploitable in the Debian
    lenny kernel as root privileges are required to exploit this
    issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3002">CVE-2009-3002</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet fixed several sensitive memory leaks in the IrDA,
    X.25 PLP (Rose), NET/ROM, Acorn Econet/AUN, and Controller Area
    Network (CAN) implementations. Local users can exploit these
    issues to gain access to kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3228">CVE-2009-3228</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet reported an instance of uninitialized kernel memory
    in the network packet scheduler. Local users may be able to
    exploit this issue to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.</p></li>
  
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3238">CVE-2009-3238</a>

    <p>Linus Torvalds provided a change to the get_random_int() function
    to increase its randomness.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3286">CVE-2009-3286</a>

    <p>Eric Paris discovered an issue with the NFSv4 server
    implementation.  When an O_EXCL create fails, files may be left
    with corrupted permissions, possibly granting unintentional
    privileges to other local users.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3547">CVE-2009-3547</a>

    <p>Earl Chew discovered a NULL pointer dereference issue in the
    pipe_rdwr_open function which can be used by local users to gain
    elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3612">CVE-2009-3612</a>

    <p>Jiri Pirko discovered a typo in the initialization of a structure
    in the netlink subsystem that may allow local users to gain access
    to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3621">CVE-2009-3621</a>

    <p>Tomoki Sekiyama discovered a deadlock condition in the UNIX domain
    socket implementation. Local users can exploit this vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service (system hang).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-26etch1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were rebuilt for
compatability with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
