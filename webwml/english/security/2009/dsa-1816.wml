<p>It was discovered that the Apache web server did not properly handle
the "Options=" parameter to the AllowOverride directive:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In the stable distribution (lenny), local users could (via .htaccess)
enable script execution in Server Side Includes even in configurations
where the AllowOverride directive contained only
Options=IncludesNoEXEC.</p></li>

<li><p>In the oldstable distribution (etch), local users could (via
.htaccess) enable script execution in Server Side Includes and CGI
script execution in configurations where the AllowOverride directive
contained any "Options=" value.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-4+etch8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.9-10+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed in version 2.2.11-6.</p>

<p>This advisory also provides updated apache2-mpm-itk packages which
have been recompiled against the new apache2 packages (except for the
s390 architecture where updated packages will follow shortly).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>
