<define-tag description>improper assertion</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Quagga, an IP routing daemon, could no longer
process the Internet routing table due to broken handling of multiple
4-byte AS numbers in an AS path.  If such a prefix is received, the
BGP daemon crashes with an assert failure, leading to a denial of
service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.10-1lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.99.11-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.</p>
