<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that OpenSSL does not properly verify DSA signatures
on X.509 certificates due to an API misuse, potentially leading to the
acceptance of incorrect X.509 certificates as genuine (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5077">CVE-2008-5077</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch4 of the openssl package, and version
0.9.7k-3.1etch2 of the openssl097 package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (lenny) will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your OpenSSL packages.</p>
