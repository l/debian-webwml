<p>Notice: Debian 5.0.4, the next point release of Debian 'lenny', will
include a new default value for the mmap_min_addr tunable.  This
change will add an additional safeguard against a class of security
vulnerabilities known as "NULL pointer dereference" vulnerabilities,
but it will need to be overridden when using certain applications.
Additional information about this change, including instructions for
making this change locally in advance of 5.0.4 (recommended), can be
found at:

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, sensitive memory leak or privilege
escalation.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3228">CVE-2009-3228</a>

    <p>Eric Dumazet reported an instance of uninitialized kernel memory
    in the network packet scheduler. Local users may be able to
    exploit this issue to read the contents of sensitive kernel
    memory.</p></li>
  
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3238">CVE-2009-3238</a>

    <p>Linus Torvalds provided a change to the get_random_int() function
    to increase its randomness.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3547">CVE-2009-3547</a>

    <p>Earl Chew discovered a NULL pointer dereference issue in the
    pipe_rdwr_open function which can be used by local users to gain
    elevated privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3612">CVE-2009-3612</a>

    <p>Jiri Pirko discovered a typo in the initialization of a structure
    in the netlink subsystem that may allow local users to gain access
    to sensitive kernel memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3620">CVE-2009-3620</a>

    <p>Ben Hutchings discovered an issue in the DRM manager for ATI Rage
    128 graphics adapters. Local users may be able to exploit this
    vulnerability to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer
    dereference).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3621">CVE-2009-3621</a>

    <p>Tomoki Sekiyama discovered a deadlock condition in the UNIX domain
    socket implementation. Local users can exploit this vulnerability
    to cause a denial of service (system hang).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3638">CVE-2009-3638</a>

    <p>David Wagner reported an overflow in the KVM subsystem on i386
    systems. This issue is exploitable by local users with access to
    the /dev/kvm device file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-19lenny2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional source packages that were
rebuilt for compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>
