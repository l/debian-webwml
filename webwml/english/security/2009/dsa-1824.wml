<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1150">CVE-2009-1150</a>

  <p>Cross site scripting vulnerability in the export page allow for an
  attacker that can place crafted cookies with the user to inject
  arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1151">CVE-2009-1151</a>

  <p>Static code injection allows for a remote attacker to inject arbitrary
  code into phpMyAdmin via the setup.php script. This script is in Debian
  under normal circumstances protected via Apache authentication.
  However, because of a recent worm based on this exploit, we are patching
  it regardless, to also protect installations that somehow still expose
  the setup.php script.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.1.1-11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
