<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that gst-plugins-bad0.10, the GStreamer plugins from
the "bad" set, is prone to an integer overflow when processing a MED
file with a crafted song comment or song name.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.3-3.1+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.7-2+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), gst-plugins-bad0.10 links against libmodplug.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gst-plugins-bad0.10 packages.</p>
