<define-tag description>denial of service, privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1630">CVE-2009-1630</a>

    <p>Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1633">CVE-2009-1633</a>

    <p>Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1758">CVE-2009-1758</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered an issue in Xen where local guest users may
    cause a denial of service (oops).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also fixes a regression introduced by the fix for
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1184">CVE-2009-1184</a> 
in 2.6.26-15lenny3. This prevents a boot time panic on systems with SELinux
enabled.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems, where
applicable, will be fixed in future updates to linux-2.6 and
linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.26-15lenny3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
