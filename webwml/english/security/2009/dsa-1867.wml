<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security issues have been discovered in kdelibs, core libraries
from the official KDE release. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1690">CVE-2009-1690</a>

<p>It was discovered that there is a use-after-free flaw in handling
certain DOM event handlers. This could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, when visiting a malicious website.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1698">CVE-2009-1698</a>

<p>It was discovered that there could be an uninitialised pointer when
handling a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) attr function call. This could
lead to the execution of arbitrary code, when visiting a malicious
website.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1687">CVE-2009-1687</a>

<p>It was discovered that the JavaScript garbage collector does not handle
allocation failures properly, which could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code when visiting a malicious website.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 4:3.5.5a.dfsg.1-8etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-0lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs packages.</p>
