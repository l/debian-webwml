<p>It was discovered that the Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management
(SLURM), a cluster job management and scheduling system, did not drop
the supplemental groups. These groups may be system groups with elevated
privileges, which may allow a valid SLURM user to gain elevated privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) does not contain a slurm-llnl package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6-1lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your slurm-llnl package.</p>
