<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tielei Wang discovered that CamlImages, an open source image processing
library, suffers from several integer overflows which may lead to a
potentially exploitable heap overflow and result in arbitrary code
execution. This advisory addresses issues with the reading of JPEG and
GIF Images, while <a href="$(HOME)/security/2009/dsa-1832">DSA 1832-1</a>
addressed the issue with PNG images.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.20-8+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.2.0-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.0.1-3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your camlimages package.</p>
