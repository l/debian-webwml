<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that the SIEVE component of cyrus-imapd and
kolab-cyrus-imapd, the Cyrus mail system, is vulnerable to a buffer
overflow when processing SIEVE scripts.
This can be used to elevate privileges to the cyrus system user.  An
attacker who is able to install SIEVE scripts executed by the server is
therefore able to read and modify arbitrary email messages on the
system. The update introduced by <a href="$(HOME)/security/2009/dsa-1881">DSA
1881-1</a> was incomplete and the issue has been given an additional CVE id due
to its complexity.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-10+etch4 for cyrus-imapd-2.2 and version 2.2.13-2+etch2
for kolab-cyrus-imapd.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny3 for cyrus-imapd-2.2, version 2.2.13-5+lenny2
for kolab-cyrus-imapd.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-15 for cyrus-imapd-2.2, and will be fixed soon for
kolab-cyrus-imapd.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 and kolab-cyrus-imapd
packages.</p>
