<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the OpenOffice.org
office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0200">CVE-2009-0200</a>

    <p>Dyon Balding of Secunia Research has discovered a vulnerability,
    which can be exploited by opening a specially crafted Microsoft
    Word document.</p>

    <p>When reading a Microsoft Word document, a bug in the parser of
    sprmTDelete records can result in an integer underflow that may
    lead to heap-based buffer overflows.</p>

    <p>Successful exploitation may allow arbitrary code execution in the               
    context of the OpenOffice.org process.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2139">CVE-2009-2139</a>

    <p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the parser of EMF files of
    OpenOffice/Go-oo 2.x and 3.x that can be triggered by a specially
    crafted document and lead to the execution of arbitrary commands
    the privileges of the user running OpenOffice.org/Go-oo.</p>

    <p>This vulnerability does not exist in the packages for oldstable,
    testing and unstable.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4.dfsg.2-7etch7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1+dfsg-1+lenny3 and higher.</p>

<p>For the unstable (sid) and testing (squeeze) distribution these
problems have been fixed in version 3.1.1~ooo310m15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Openoffice.org package.</p>
