<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in asterisk, an Open Source
PBX and telephony toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0041">CVE-2009-0041</a>

<p>It is possible to determine valid login names via probing, due to the
IAX2 response from asterisk (AST-2009-001).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3903">CVE-2008-3903</a>

<p>It is possible to determine a valid SIP username, when Digest
authentication and authalwaysreject are enabled (AST-2009-003).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3727">CVE-2009-3727</a>

<p>It is possible to determine a valid SIP username via multiple crafted
REGISTER messages (AST-2009-008).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-7220">CVE-2008-7220</a> <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-2383">CVE-2007-2383</a>

<p>It was discovered that asterisk contains an obsolete copy of the
Prototype JavaScript framework, which is vulnerable to several security
issues. This copy is unused and now removed from asterisk
(AST-2009-009).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4055">CVE-2009-4055</a>

<p>It was discovered that it is possible to perform a denial of service
attack via  RTP comfort noise payload with a long data length
(AST-2009-010).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The current version in oldstable is not supported by upstream anymore
and is affected by several security issues. Backporting fixes for these
and any future issues has become unfeasible and therefore we need to
drop our security support for the version in oldstable. We recommend
that all asterisk users upgrade to the stable distribution (lenny).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.4.21.2~dfsg-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1:1.6.2.0~rc7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your asterisk packages.</p>
