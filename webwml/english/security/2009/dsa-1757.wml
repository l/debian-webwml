<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that auth2db, an IDS logger, log viewer and alert
generator, is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability, when used with
multibyte character encodings.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) doesn't contain auth2db.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5-2+dfsg-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.5-2+dfsg-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your auth2db packages.</p>
