<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A denial of service vulnerability has been found in nginx, a small and
efficient web server.</p>

<p>Jasson Bell discovered that a remote attacker could cause a denial of service
(segmentation fault) by sending a crafted request.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
0.4.13-2+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
0.6.32-3+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distributions, this problem has
been fixed in version 0.7.62-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nginx package.</p>
