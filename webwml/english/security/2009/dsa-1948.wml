<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Robin Park and Dmitri Vinokurov discovered that the daemon component of
the ntp package, a reference implementation of the NTP protocol, is
not properly reacting to certain incoming packets.</p>

<p>An unexpected NTP mode 7 packets (MODE_PRIVATE) with spoofed IP data can lead
ntpd to reply with a mode 7 response to the spoofed address.  This may result
in the service playing packet ping-pong with other ntp servers or even itself
which causes CPU usage and excessive disk use due to logging.  An attacker
can use this to conduct denial of service attacks.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.2.p4+dfsg-2etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.2.4p4+dfsg-8lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.</p>
