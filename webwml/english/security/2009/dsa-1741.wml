<p>Jesus Olmos Gonzalez discovered that an integer overflow in the PSI 
Jabber client may lead to remote denial of service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.11-9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1.</p>
