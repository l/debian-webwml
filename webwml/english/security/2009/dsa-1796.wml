<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that the embedded GD library copy in libwmf,
a library to parse windows metafiles (WMF), makes use of a pointer
after it was already freed.  An attacker using a crafted WMF file can
cause a denial of service or possibly the execute arbitrary code via
applications using this library.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.4-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.4-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.4-6.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libwmf packages.</p>
