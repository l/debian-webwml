<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Network Security
Service libraries. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2404">CVE-2009-2404</a>

   <p>Moxie Marlinspike discovered that a buffer overflow in the regular
   expression parser could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2408">CVE-2009-2408</a>

   <p>Dan Kaminsky discovered that NULL characters in certificate
   names could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks by tricking the user

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2409">CVE-2009-2409</a>

   <p>Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted
   since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't contain nss.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-0lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.12.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
