<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that xapian-omega, a CGI interface for searching xapian
databases, is not properly escaping user supplied input when printing
exceptions.  An attacker can use this to conduct cross-site scripting
attacks via crafted search queries resulting in an exception and steal
potentially sensitive data from web applications running on the same domain
or embedding the search engine into a website.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.9-1+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.7-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xapian-omega packages.</p>
