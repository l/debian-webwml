<define-tag description>missing input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Christian J. Eibl discovered that the TeX filter of Moodle, a web-based
course management system, doesn't check user input for certain TeX commands
which allows an attacker to include and display the content of arbitrary system
files.</p>

<p>Note that this doesn't affect installations that only use the mimetex
environment.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.3-2+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.2.dfsg-5.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your moodle packages.</p>
