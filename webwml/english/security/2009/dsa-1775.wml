<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that php-json-ext, a JSON serialiser for PHP, is
prone to a denial of service attack, when receiving a malformed string
via the json_decode function.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-3.2+etch1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (lenny) does not contain a separate php-json-ext
package, but includes it in the php5 packages, which will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
do not contain a separate php-json-ext package, but include it in the
php5 packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php-json-ext packages.</p>
