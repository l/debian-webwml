<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no longer accepted by OpenSSL,
since they're no longer considered cryptographically secure.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8g-15+lenny5.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8c-4etch9 for openssl and version 0.9.7k-3.1etch5 for
openssl097.
The OpenSSL 0.9.8 update for oldstable (etch) also provides updated
packages for multiple denial of service vulnerabilities in the
Datagram Transport Layer Security implementation. These fixes were
already provided for Debian stable (Lenny) in a previous point
update. The OpenSSL 0.9.7 package from oldstable (Etch) is not
affected. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1377">CVE-2009-1377</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1378">CVE-2009-1378</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1379">CVE-2009-1379</a>,

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8k-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
