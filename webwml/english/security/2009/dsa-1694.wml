<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo discovered that xterm, a terminal emulator for the X Window
System, places arbitrary characters into the input buffer when
displaying certain crafted escape sequences (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2383">CVE-2008-2383</a>).</p>

<p>As an additional precaution, this security update also disables font
changing, user-defined keys, and X property changes through escape
sequences.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 222-1etch3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xterm package.</p>
