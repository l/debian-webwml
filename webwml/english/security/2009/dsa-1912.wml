<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that CamlImages, an open source image processing
library, suffers from several integer overflows, which may lead to a
potentially exploitable heap overflow and result in arbitrary code
execution. This advisory addresses issues with the reading of TIFF
files. It also expands the patch for <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-2660">CVE-2009-2660</a> to cover another
potential overflow in the processing of JPEG images.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.20-8+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.2.0-4+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your camlimages package.</p>
