<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Dan Kaminsky and Moxie Marlinspike discovered that gnutls, an implementation of
the TLS/SSL protocol, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name
in the subject's Common Name or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of an X.509
certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL
servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification
Authority. (<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2730">CVE-2009-2730</a>)</p>

<p>In addition, with this update, certificates with MD2 hash signatures are no
longer accepted since they're no longer considered cryptograhically secure. It
only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).(<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2409">CVE-2009-2409</a>)</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.4-3+etch5 for gnutls13.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
2.4.2-6+lenny2 for gnutls26.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the  unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2.8.3-1 for gnutls26.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls13/gnutls26 packages.</p>
