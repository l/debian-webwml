<p>It was discovered that netatalk, an implementation of the AppleTalk
suite, is affected by a command injection vulnerability when processing
PostScript streams via papd.  This could lead to the execution of
arbitrary code.  Please note that this only affects installations that are
configured to use a pipe command in combination with wildcard symbols
substituted with values of the printed job.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (lenny) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.3-11+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4~beta2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netatalk package.</p>
