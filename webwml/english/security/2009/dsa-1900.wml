<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in PostgreSQL, an SQL
database system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3229">CVE-2009-3229</a>

<p>Authenticated users can shut down the backend server by re-LOAD-ing
libraries in $libdir/plugins, if any libraries are present there.
(The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3230">CVE-2009-3230</a>

<p>Authenticated non-superusers can gain database superuser privileges if
they can create functions and tables due to incorrect execution of
functions in functional indexes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3231">CVE-2009-3231</a>

<p>If PostgreSQL is configured with LDAP authentication, and the LDAP
configuration allows anonymous binds, it is possible for a user to
authenticate themselves with an empty password.  (The old stable
distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>In addition, this update contains reliability improvements which do
not target security issues.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.4.26-0etch1 of the postgresql-7.4 source package, and
version 8.1.18-0etch1 of the postgresql-8.1 source package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.3.8-0lenny1 of the postgresql-8.3 source package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 8.3.8-1 of the postgresql-8.3 source package, and version
8.4.1-1 of the postgresql-8.4 source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your PostgreSQL packages.</p>
