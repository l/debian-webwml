<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that GForge, a collaborative development tool,
insufficiently sanitises some input allowing a remote attacker to
perform SQL injection.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.14-22etch10.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this problem
has been fixed in version 4.7~rc2-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge package.</p>
