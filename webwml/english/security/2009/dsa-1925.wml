<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that proftpd-dfsg, a virtual-hosting FTP daemon,
does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the
Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 client certificate, when the
dNSNameRequired TLS option is enabled.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.1-17lenny4.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.0-19etch3.</p>

<p>Binaries for the amd64 architecture will be released once they are
available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.2a-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.</p>
