<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that yaws, a high performance HTTP 1.1 webserver, is
prone to a denial of service attack via a request with a large HTTP
header.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.77-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.65-4etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.80-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your yaws package.</p>
