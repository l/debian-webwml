<p>It was discovered that mahara, an electronic portfolio, weblog, and
resume builder, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks, which allows
the injection of arbitrary Java or HTML code.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain mahara.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara package.</p>
