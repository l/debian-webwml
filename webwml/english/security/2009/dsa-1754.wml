<define-tag description>insufficient access checks</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that roundup, an issue tracker with a command-line,
web and email interface, allows users to edit resources in
unauthorized ways, including granting themselves admin rights.</p>

<p>This update introduces stricter access checks, actually enforcing the
configured permissions and roles.  This means that the configuration
may need updating.  In addition, user registration via the web
interface has been disabled; use the program "roundup-admin" from the
command line instead.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-10+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundup package.</p>
