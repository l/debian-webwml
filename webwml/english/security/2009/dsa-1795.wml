<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Kaltenbrunner discovered that ldns, a library and set of utilities
to facilitate DNS programming, did not correctly implement a buffer
boundary check in its RR DNS record parser.  This weakness could enable
overflow of a heap buffer if a maliciously-crafted record is parsed,
potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code.  The scope of
compromise will vary with the context in which ldns is used, and could
present either a local or remote attack vector.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem was fixed in
version 1.5.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldns packages.</p>
