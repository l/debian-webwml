<p>It was discovered that znc, an IRC proxy, did not properly process
certain DCC requests, allowing attackers to upload arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version  0.045-3+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.058-2+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.074-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your znc package.</p>
