<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that a buffer overflow in NSD, an authoritative
name service daemon, allowed to crash the server by sending a crafted packet,
creating a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.6-1+etch1 of the nsd package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-1.1+lenny1 of the nsd package and version 3.0.7-3.lenny2
of the nsd3 package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-3 for nsd; nsd3 will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nsd or nsd3 package.</p>
