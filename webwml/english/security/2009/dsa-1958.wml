<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that ltdl, a system-independent dlopen wrapper for
GNU libtool, can be tricked to load and run modules from an arbitrary
directory, which might be used to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the user running an application that uses libltdl.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.22-4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.26-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in 2.2.6b-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtool packages.</p>
