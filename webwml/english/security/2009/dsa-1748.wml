<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that libsoup, an HTTP library implementation in C,
handles large strings insecurely via its Base64 encoding functions. This
could possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.98-2+etch1.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (lenny) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
are not affected by this issue.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsoup packages.</p>
