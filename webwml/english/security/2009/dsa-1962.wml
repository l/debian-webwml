<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in kvm, a full virtualization system.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3638">CVE-2009-3638</a>

<p>It was discovered an Integer overflow in the kvm_dev_ioctl_get_supported_cpuid
function. This allows local users to have an unspecified impact via a
KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID request to the kvm_arch_dev_ioctl function.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3722">CVE-2009-3722</a>

<p>It was discovered that the handle_dr function in the KVM subsystem does not
properly verify the Current Privilege Level (CPL) before accessing a debug
register, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (trap) on the
host OS via a crafted application.</p></li>


<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-4031">CVE-2009-4031</a>

<p>It was discovered that the do_insn_fetch function in the x86 emulator in the KVM
subsystem tries to interpret instructions that contain too many bytes to be
valid, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (increased
scheduling latency) on the host OS via unspecified manipulations related to SMP
support.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in version
72+dfsg-5~lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kvm package.</p>
