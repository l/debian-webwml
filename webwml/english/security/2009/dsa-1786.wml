<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that acpid, a daemon for delivering ACPI events, is
prone to a denial of service attack by opening a large number of UNIX
sockets, which are not closed properly.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.8-1lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-5etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.0.10-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your acpid packages.</p>
