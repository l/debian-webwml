<define-tag description>insufficient input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The forms library of python-django, a high-level Python web development
framework, is using a badly chosen regular expression when validating
email addresses and URLs.  An attacker can use this to perform denial
of service attacks (100% CPU consumption) due to bad backtracking
via a specially crafted email address or URL which is validated by the
django forms library.</p>


<p>python-django in the oldstable distribution (etch), is not affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-1+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
