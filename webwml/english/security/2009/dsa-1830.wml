<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-0lenny1.</p>

<p>As indicated in the Etch release notes, security support for the
Mozilla products in the oldstable distribution needed to be stopped
before the end of the regular Etch security maintenance life cycle.
You are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a still
supported mail client.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) distribution these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.0.22-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
