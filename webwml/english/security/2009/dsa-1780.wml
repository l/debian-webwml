<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in libdbd-pg-perl, the DBI
driver module for PostgreSQL database access (DBD::Pg).</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0663">CVE-2009-0663</a>

  <p>A heap-based buffer overflow may allow attackers to execute arbitrary
  code through applications which read rows from the database using the
  pg_getline and getline functions.  (More common retrieval methods,
  such as selectall_arrayref and fetchrow_array, are not affected.)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1341">CVE-2009-1341</a>

  <p>A memory leak in the routine which unquotes BYTEA values returned from
  the database allows attackers to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.49-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 2.1.3-1 before the release of
lenny.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-pg-perl package.</p>
