<define-tag description>insufficient input validation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that the statuswml.cgi script of nagios, a monitoring
and management system for hosts, services and networks, is prone to a
command injection vulnerability.  Input to the ping and traceroute parameters
of the script is not properly validated which allows an attacker to execute
arbitrary shell commands by passing a crafted value to these parameters.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-2+etch3 of nagios2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6-4~lenny2 of nagios3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6-5 of nagios3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.6-5 of nagios3.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nagios2/nagios3 packages.</p>
