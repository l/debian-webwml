<define-tag description>denial of service/privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1385">CVE-2009-1385</a>

    <p>Neil Horman discovered a missing fix from the e1000 network
    driver.  A remote user may cause a denial of service by way of a
    kernel panic triggered by specially crafted frame sizes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1389">CVE-2009-1389</a>

    <p>Michael Tokarev discovered an issue in the r8169 network driver.
    Remote users on the same LAN may cause a denial of service by way
    of a kernel panic triggered by receiving a large size frame.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1630">CVE-2009-1630</a>

    <p>Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1633">CVE-2009-1633</a>

    <p>Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2692">CVE-2009-2692</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes discovered an issue with how the
    sendpage function is initialized in the proto_ops structure.
    Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated
    privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-24etch3.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>&nbsp;</th>                     <th>Debian 4.0 (etch)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>                <td>1.17+etch.24etch3</td></tr>
<tr><td>user-mode-linux</td>            <td>2.6.18-1um-2etch.24etch3</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
