<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tunapie, a GUI frontend
to video and radio streams. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1253">CVE-2009-1253</a>

    <p>Kees Cook discovered that insecure handling of temporary files may
    lead to local denial of service through symlink attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1254">CVE-2009-1254</a>

    <p>Mike Coleman discovered that insufficient escaping of stream
    URLs may lead to the execution of arbitrary commands if a user
    is tricked into opening a malformed stream URL.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.1-1+etch2. Due to a technical problem, this update cannot
be released synchronously with the stable (lenny) version, but will
appear soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.8-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tunapie package.</p>
