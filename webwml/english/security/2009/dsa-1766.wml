<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in the MIT reference implementation
of Kerberos V5, a system for authenticating users and services on a network.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identified the following
problems:</p>

<p>The Apple Product Security team discovered that the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism
suffers of a missing bounds check when reading a network input buffer which
results in an invalid read crashing the application or possibly leaking
information (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0844">CVE-2009-0844</a>).</p>

<p>Under certain conditions the SPNEGO GSS-API mechanism references a null pointer
which crashes the application using the library (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0845">CVE-2009-0845</a>).</p>

<p>An incorrect length check inside the ASN.1 decoder of the MIT krb5
implementation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to crash of the kinit
or KDC program (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0847">CVE-2009-0847</a>).</p>

<p>Under certain conditions the the ASN.1 decoder of the MIT krb5 implementation
frees an uninitialized pointer which could lead to denial of service and
possibly arbitrary code execution (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0846">CVE-2009-0846</a>).</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7etch7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-5lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.dfsg.4~beta1-13.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
