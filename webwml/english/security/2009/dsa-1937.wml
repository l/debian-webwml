<p>It was discovered that gforge, collaborative development tool, is prone
to a cross-site scripting attack via the helpname parameter. Beside
fixing this issue, the update also introduces some additional input
sanitising. However, there are no known attack vectors.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.14-22etch12.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problem have been fixed in
version 4.7~rc2-7lenny2.</p>
