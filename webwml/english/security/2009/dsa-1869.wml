<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that curl, a client and library to get files from servers
using HTTP, HTTPS or FTP, is vulnerable to the "Null Prefix Attacks Against
SSL/TLS Certificates" recently published at the Blackhat conference.  This
allows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks via a
crafted ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the Common
Name field.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.15.5-1etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.18.2-8lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
