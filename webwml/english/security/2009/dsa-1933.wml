<p>Aaron Siegel discovered that the web interface of cups, the Common UNIX
Printing System, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.7-4+etch9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.8-1+lenny7.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
