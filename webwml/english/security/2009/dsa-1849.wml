<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the W3C XML Signature recommendation contains a
protocol-level vulnerability related to HMAC output truncation.  This
update implements the proposed workaround in the C++ version of the
Apache implementation of this standard, xml-security-c, by preventing
truncation to output strings shorter than 80 bits or half of the
original HMAC output, whichever is greater.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-3+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xml-security-c packages.</p>
