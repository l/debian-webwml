<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based
web framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0843">CVE-2009-0843</a>

  <p>Missing input validation on a user supplied map queryfile name can be
  used by an attacker to check for the existence of a specific file by
  using the queryfile GET parameter and checking for differences in error
  messages.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0842">CVE-2009-0842</a>

  <p>A lack of file type verification when parsing a map file can lead to
  partial disclosure of content from arbitrary files through parser error
  messages.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0841">CVE-2009-0841</a>

  <p>Due to missing input validation when saving map files under certain
  conditions it is possible to perform directory traversal attacks and
  to create arbitrary files.
  NOTE: Unless the attacker is able to create directories in the image
  path or there is already a readable directory this doesn't affect
  installations on Linux as the fopen() syscall will fail in case a sub
  path is not readable.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0839">CVE-2009-0839</a>

  <p>It was discovered that mapserver is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer
  overflow when processing certain GET parameters.  An attacker can use
  this to execute arbitrary code on the server via crafted id parameters.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0840">CVE-2009-0840</a>

  <p>An integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow when
  processing the Content-Length header of an HTTP request can be used by an
  attacker to execute arbitrary code via crafted POST requests containing
  negative Content-Length values.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2281">CVE-2009-2281</a>

  <p>An integer overflow when processing HTTP requests can lead to a
  heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker can use this to execute arbitrary
  code either via crafted Content-Length values or large HTTP request. This
  is partly because of an incomplete fix for
  <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0840">CVE-2009-0840</a>.</p></li>


</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.10.0-5.1+etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.3-3+lenny4.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.2-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mapserver packages.</p>
