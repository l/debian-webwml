<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sylvain Beucler discovered that gforge, a collaborative development
tool, is prone to a symlink attack, which allows local users to perform
a denial of service attack by overwriting arbitrary files.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.14-22etch13.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.7~rc2-7lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8.2-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge packages.</p>
