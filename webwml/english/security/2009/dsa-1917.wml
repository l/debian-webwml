<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in mimetex, a lightweight
alternative to MathML. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1382">CVE-2009-1382</a>

<p>Chris Evans and Damien Miller, discovered multiple stack-based buffer overflow.
An attacker could execute arbitrary code via a TeX file with long picture,
circle, input tags.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2459">CVE-2009-2459</a>

<p>Chris Evans discovered that mimeTeX contained certain directives that may be
unsuitable for handling untrusted user input. A remote attacker can obtain
sensitive information.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.50-1+etch1.</p>

<p>Due to a bug in the archive system, the fix for the stable distribution
(lenny) will be released as version 1.50-1+lenny1 once it is available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 1.50-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mimetex packages.</p>
