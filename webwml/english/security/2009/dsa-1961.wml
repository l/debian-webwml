<define-tag description>DNS cache poisoning</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michael Sinatra discovered that the DNS resolver component in BIND
does not properly check DNS records contained in additional sections
of DNS responses, leading to a cache poisoning vulnerability.  This
vulnerability is only present in resolvers which have been configured
with DNSSEC trust anchors, which is still rare.</p>

<p>Note that this update contains an internal ABI change, which means
that all BIND-related packages (bind9, dnsutils and the library
packages) must be updated at the same time (preferably using "apt-get
update" and "apt-get upgrade").  In the unlikely event that you have
compiled your own software against libdns, you must recompile this
programs, too.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.3.4-2etch6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.5.1.dfsg.P3-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) and the testing distribution
(squeeze), this problem has been fixed in version 9.6.1.dfsg.P2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
