<p>Federico Muttis discovered that libpurple, the shared library that adds
support for various instant messaging networks to the pidgin IM client, is
vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow.  This issue exists because of
an incomplete fix for <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2927">CVE-2008-2927</a> and <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1376">CVE-2009-1376</a>.  An attacker can
exploit this by sending two consecutive SLP packets to a victim via MSN.</p>

<p>The first packet is used to create an SLP message object with an offset of
zero, the second packet then contains a crafted offset which hits the
vulnerable code originally fixed in <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-2927">CVE-2008-2927</a> and <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1376">CVE-2009-1376</a> and
allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Note: Users with the "Allow only the users below" setting are not vulnerable
to this attack. If you can't install the below updates you may want to
set this via Tools->Privacy.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.</p>
