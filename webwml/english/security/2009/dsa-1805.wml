<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pidgin, a graphical
multi-protocol instant messaging client. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1373">CVE-2009-1373</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in the Jabber file transfer code may lead to
    denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1375">CVE-2009-1375</a>

    <p>Memory corruption in an internal library may lead to denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1376">CVE-2009-1376</a>

    <p>The patch provided for the security issue tracked as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-2927">CVE-2008-2927</a>
    - integer overflows in the MSN protocol handler - was found to be
    incomplete.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is affected under the source package
name gaim. However, due to build problems the updated packages couldn't
be released along with the stable version. It will be released once the
build problem is resolved.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.3-4lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pidgin packages.</p>
