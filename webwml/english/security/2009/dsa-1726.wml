<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mike Wiacek discovered that a buffer overflow in the ARC2 implementation
of Python Crypto, a collection of cryptographic algorithms and protocols
for Python allows denial of service and potentially the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1+dfsg1-2.3+lenny0.</p>

<p>Due to a technical limitation in the Debian archive management scripts
the update for the old stable distribution (etch) cannot be released
synchronously. It will be fixed in version 2.0.1+dfsg1-1.2+etch0 soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-crypto package.</p>
