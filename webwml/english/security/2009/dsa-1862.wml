<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the Linux kernel that may lead
to privilege escalation. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problem:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2692">CVE-2009-2692</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy and Julien Tinnes discovered an issue with how the
    sendpage function is initialized in the proto_ops structure.
    Local users can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated
    privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem will be fixed in
updates to linux-2.6 and linux-2.6.24.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.26-17lenny2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 and user-mode-linux
packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
