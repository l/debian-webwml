<define-tag description>denial of service/privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service or privilege escalation. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1385">CVE-2009-1385</a>

    <p>Neil Horman discovered a missing fix from the e1000 network driver.
    A remote user may cause a denial of service by way of a kernel panic
    triggered by specially crafted frame sizes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1389">CVE-2009-1389</a>

    <p>Michael Tokarev discovered an issue in the r8169 network driver.
    Remote users on the same LAN may cause a denial of service by way
    of a kernel panic triggered by receiving a large size frame.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1630">CVE-2009-1630</a>

    <p>Frank Filz discovered that local users may be able to execute
    files without execute permission when accessed via an nfs4 mount.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1633">CVE-2009-1633</a>

    <p>Jeff Layton and Suresh Jayaraman fixed several buffer overflows in
    the CIFS filesystem which allow remote servers to cause memory
    corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1895">CVE-2009-1895</a>

    <p>Julien Tinnes and Tavis Ormandy reported an issue in the Linux
    personality code. Local users can take advantage of a setuid
    binary that can either be made to dereference a NULL pointer or
    drop privileges and return control to the user. This allows a
    user to bypass mmap_min_addr restrictions which can be exploited
    to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1914">CVE-2009-1914</a>

    <p>Mikulas Patocka discovered an issue in sparc64 kernels that allows
    local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by reading the
    /proc/iomem file.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1961">CVE-2009-1961</a>

    <p>Miklos Szeredi reported an issue in the ocfs2 filesystem. Local
    users can create a denial of service (filesystem deadlock) using
    a particular sequence of splice system calls.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2406">CVE-2009-2406</a>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2407">CVE-2009-2407</a>

    <p>Ramon de Carvalho Valle discovered two issues with the eCryptfs
    layered filesystem using the fsfuzzer utility. A local user with
    permissions to perform an eCryptfs mount may modify the contents
    of a eCryptfs file, overflowing the stack and potentially gaining
    elevated privileges.</p></li>

</ul>
    
<p>For the stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.24-6~etchnhalf.8etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6.24 packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian 'etch' includes linux kernel packages based upon both the
2.6.18 and 2.6.24 linux releases.  All known security issues are
carefully tracked against both packages and both packages will receive
security updates until security support for Debian 'etch'
concludes. However, given the high frequency at which low-severity
security issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource
requirements of doing an update, lower severity 2.6.18 and 2.6.24
updates will typically release in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
