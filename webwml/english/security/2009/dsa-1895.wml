<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the xmltooling packages,
as used by Shibboleth:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Chris Ries discovered that decoding a crafted URL leads to a crash (and
potentially, arbitrary code execution).</p></li>

<li><p>Ian Young discovered that embedded NUL characters in certificate names
were not correctly handled, exposing configurations using PKIX trust
validation to impersonation attacks.</p></li>

<li><p>Incorrect processing of SAML metadata ignores key usage constraints.
This minor issue also needs a correction in the opensaml2 packages,
which will be provided in an upcoming stable point release (and,
before that, via stable-proposed-updates).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmltooling packages.</p>
