<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>James Ralston discovered that the sasl_encode64() function of cyrus-sasl2,
a free library implementing the Simple Authentication and Security Layer,
suffers from a missing null termination in certain situations.  This causes
several buffer overflows in situations where cyrus-sasl2 itself requires
the string to be null terminated which can lead to denial of service or
arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>Important notice (Quoting from US-CERT):
While this patch will fix currently vulnerable code, it can cause
non-vulnerable existing code to break. Here's a function prototype from
include/saslutil.h to clarify my explanation:</p>

<pre>/* base64 encode
* in -- input data
* inlen -- input data length
* out -- output buffer (will be NUL terminated)
* outmax -- max size of output buffer
* result:
* outlen -- gets actual length of output buffer (optional)
*
* Returns SASL_OK on success, SASL_BUFOVER if result won't fit
*/
LIBSASL_API int sasl_encode64(const char *in, unsigned inlen,
char *out, unsigned outmax,
unsigned *outlen);</pre>

<p>Assume a scenario where calling code has been written in such a way that it
calculates the exact size required for base64 encoding in advance, then
allocates a buffer of that exact size, passing a pointer to the buffer into
sasl_encode64() as *out. As long as this code does not anticipate that the
buffer is NUL-terminated (does not call any string-handling functions like
strlen(), for example) the code will work and it will not be vulnerable.</p>

<p>Once this patch is applied, that same code will break because sasl_encode64()
will begin to return SASL_BUFOVER.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.22.dfsg1-8+etch1 of cyrus-sasl2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.22.dfsg1-23+lenny1 of cyrus-sasl2 and cyrus-sasl2-heimdal.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.23.dfsg1-1 of cyrus-sasl2 and cyrus-sasl2-heimdal.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-sasl2/cyrus-sasl2-heimdal packages.</p>
