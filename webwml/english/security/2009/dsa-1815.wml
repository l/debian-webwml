<p>It was discovered that the Rasterbar Bittorrent library performed
insufficient validation of path names specified in torrent files, which
could lead to denial of service by overwriting files.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) doesn't include libtorrent-rasterbar.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.13.1-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.14.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtorrent-rasterbar package.</p>
