<define-tag description>missing escape function</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that postgresql-ocaml, OCaml bindings to PostgreSQL's
libpq, was missing a function to call PQescapeStringConn(). This is
needed, because PQescapeStringConn() honours the charset of the
connection and prevents insufficient escaping, when certain multibyte
character encodings are used. The added function is called
escape_string_conn() and takes the established database connection as a
first argument. The old escape_string() was kept for backwards
compatibility.</p>

<p>Developers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to
use the new function.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.0-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.12.1-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-ocaml packages.</p>
