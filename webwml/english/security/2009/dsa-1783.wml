<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been identified affecting MySQL, a
relational database server, and its associated interactive client
application.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following two problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-3963">CVE-2008-3963</a>

    <p>Kay Roepke reported that the MySQL server would not properly handle
    an empty bit-string literal in an SQL statement, allowing an
    authenticated remote attacker to cause a denial of service (a crash)
    in mysqld.  This issue affects the oldstable distribution (etch), but
    not the stable distribution (lenny).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-4456">CVE-2008-4456</a>

    <p>Thomas Henlich reported that the MySQL commandline client application
    did not encode HTML special characters when run in HTML output mode
    (that is, "mysql --html ...").  This could potentially lead to
    cross-site scripting or unintended script privilege escalation if
    the resulting output is viewed in a browser or incorporated into
    a web site.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny),  these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-5.0 packages.</p>
