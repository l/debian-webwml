<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Erik Sjoelund discovered that a race condition in the stap tool shipped
by Systemtap, an instrumentation system for Linux 2.6, allows local
privilege escalation for members of the stapusr group.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) isn't affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20080705-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20090314-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your systemtap package.</p>
