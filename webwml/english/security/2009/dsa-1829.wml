<p>It was discovered that sork-passwd-h3, a Horde3 module for users to
change their password, is prone to a cross-site scripting attack via the
backend parameter.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1-1.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sork-passwd-h3 packages.</p>
