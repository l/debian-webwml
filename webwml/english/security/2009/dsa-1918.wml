<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in phpMyAdmin, a tool
to administer MySQL over the web. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3696">CVE-2009-3696</a>

  <p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows remote attackers to
  inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted MySQL table name.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-3697">CVE-2009-3697</a>

  <p>SQL injection vulnerability in the PDF schema generator functionality 
  allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands. This issue
  does not apply to the version in Debian 4.0 Etch.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, extra fortification has been added for the web based setup.php
script. Although the shipped web server configuration should ensure that
this script is protected, in practice this turned out not always to be the
case. The config.inc.php file is not writable anymore by the webserver user.
See README.Debian for details on how to enable the setup.php
script if and when you need it.</p>


<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9.1.1-13.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.11.8.1-5+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
