<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the Lightweight
Directory Access Protocol, when OpenSSL is used, does not properly handle a '\0'
character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509
certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL
servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.3.30-5+etch3 for openldap2.3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
2.4.11-1+lenny1 for openldap.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the  unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.17-2.1 for openldap.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openldap2.3/openldap packages.</p>
