<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that ejabberd, a distributed, fault-tolerant
Jabber/XMPP server, does not sufficiently sanitise MUC logs, allowing
remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not affected by this issue.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ejabberd packages.</p>
