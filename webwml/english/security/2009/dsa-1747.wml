<p>Diego Petten discovered that glib2.0, the GLib library of C routines,
handles large strings insecurely via its Base64 encoding functions. This
could possible lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.16.6-1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12.4-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.20.0-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your glib2.0 packages.</p>
