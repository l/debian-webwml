<p>Matt Murphy discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not
verify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially
crafted source code files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 15.6-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>Due to a technical limitation in the Debian archive management scripts
the update for the old stable distribution (etch) cannot be released
synchronously. It will be fixed in version 15.6-2+etch1 soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cscope package.</p>
