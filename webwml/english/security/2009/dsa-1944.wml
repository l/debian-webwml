<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Mikal Gule discovered that request-tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket
tracking system, is prone to an attack, where an attacker with access
to the same domain can hijack a user's RT session.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-4+etch1 of request-tracker3.6 and version 3.4.5-2+etch1
of request-tracker3.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.7-5+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.9-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker packages.</p>
