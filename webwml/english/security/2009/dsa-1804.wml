<define-tag description>null pointer dereference, memory leaks</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in racoon, the Internet Key
Exchange daemon of ipsec-tools.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1574">CVE-2009-1574</a>
<p>Neil Kettle discovered a NULL pointer dereference on crafted fragmented packets
that contain no payload.  This results in the daemon crashing which can be used
for denial of service attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1632">CVE-2009-1632</a>
<p>Various memory leaks in the X.509 certificate authentication handling and the
NAT-Traversal keepalive implementation can result in memory exhaustion and
thus denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.6-3.1etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.1-1.3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.7.1-1.5.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ipsec-tools packages.</p>
