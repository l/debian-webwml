<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Moodle, an online
course management system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0500">CVE-2009-0500</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the information stored in the log tables
    was not properly sanitized, which could allow attackers to inject
    arbitrary web code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-0502">CVE-2009-0502</a>

    <p>It was discovered that certain input via the "Login as" function
    was not properly sanitised leading to the injection of arbitrary
    web script.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-5153">CVE-2008-5153</a>

    <p>Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that the SpellCheker plugin creates
    temporary files insecurely, allowing a denial of service attack.
    Since the plugin was unused, it is removed in this update.</p></li>

</ul>

version 1.6.3-2+etch2.</p>

<p>For the testing (lenny) distribution these problems have been fixed in
