<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dan Kaminsky and Moxie Marlinspike discovered that kdelibs, core libraries from
the official KDE release, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain
name in the Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows
man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted
certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:3.5.5a.dfsg.1-8etch3.</p>

<p>Due to a bug in the archive system, the fix for the stable distribution
(lenny), will be released as version 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-0lenny3 once it is
available.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), and the unstable distribution (sid),
this problem has been fixed in version 4:3.5.10.dfsg.1-2.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs packages.</p>
