<define-tag description>memory leak</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The regular expression engine of Ruby, a scripting language, contains a
memory leak which can be triggered remotely under certain circumstances,
leading to a denial of service condition (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3443">CVE-2008-3443</a>).</p>

<p>In addition, this security update addresses a regression in the REXML
XML parser of the ruby1.8 package; the regression was introduced in
DSA-1651-1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
1.8.5-4etch4 of the ruby1.8 package, and version 1.9.0+20060609-1etch4
of the ruby1.9 package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.7.72-1 of the ruby1.8 package.  The ruby1.9 package will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Ruby packages.</p>
