<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1886">CVE-2009-1886</a>

    <p>The smbclient utility contains a formatstring vulnerability where
    commands dealing with file names treat user input as format strings
    to asprintf.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1888">CVE-2009-1888</a>

    <p>In  the smbd daemon, if a user is trying to modify an access control
    list (ACL) and is denied permission, this deny may be overridden if
    the parameter "dos filemode" is set to "yes" in the smb.conf and the
    user already has write access to the file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.5-4lenny6.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid), which is only affected by <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1888">CVE-2009-1888</a>,
will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba package.</p>
