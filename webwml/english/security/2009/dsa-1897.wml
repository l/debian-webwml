<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Esser discovered that Horde, a web application framework providing
classes for dealing with preferences, compression, browser detection,
connection tracking, MIME, and more, is insufficiently validating and
escaping user provided input.  The Horde_Form_Type_image form element
allows to reuse a temporary filename on reuploads which are stored in a
hidden HTML field and then trusted without prior validation.  An attacker
can use this to overwrite arbitrary files on the system or to upload PHP
code and thus execute arbitrary code with the rights of the webserver.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2+debian0-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5+debian0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.5+debian0-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde3 packages.</p>
