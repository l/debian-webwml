<p>Peter Valchev discovered an error in expat, an XML parsing C library,
when parsing certain UTF-8 sequences, which can be exploited to crash an
application using the library.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.95.8-3.4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-4+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.</p>
