<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that git-daemon which is part of git-core, a popular
distributed revision control system, is vulnerable to denial of service
attacks caused by a programming mistake in handling requests containing
extra unrecognized arguments which results in an infinite loop. While
this is no problem for the daemon itself as every request will spawn a
new git-daemon instance, this still results in a very high CPU consumption
and might lead to denial of service conditions.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4.4-4+etch3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.6.5-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.3.3-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.6.3.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git-core packages.</p>
