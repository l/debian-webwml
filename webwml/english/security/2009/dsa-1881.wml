<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the SIEVE component of cyrus-imapd, a highly scalable
enterprise mail system, is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when processing
SIEVE scripts.  Due to incorrect use of the sizeof() operator an attacker is
able to pass a negative length to snprintf() calls resulting in large positive
values due to integer conversion.  This causes a buffer overflow which can be
used to elevate privileges to the cyrus system user.  An attacker who is able
to install SIEVE scripts executed by the server is therefore able to read and
modify arbitrary email messages on the system.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-10+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.13-14+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) and unstable (sid) distribution, this problem
will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-imapd-2.2 packages.</p>
