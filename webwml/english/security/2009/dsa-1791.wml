<p>It was discovered that the AttachFile action in moin, a python clone of
WikiWiki, is prone to cross-site scripting attacks when renaming
attachements or performing other sub-actions.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) is not vulnerable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.1-3+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing (squeeze) distribution and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your moin packages.</p>
