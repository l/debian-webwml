<define-tag description>heap-based buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Two vulnerabilities have been found in libsndfile, a library to read
and write sampled audio data.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identified the following problems:</p>

<p>Tobias Klein discovered that the VOC parsing routines suffer of a heap-based
buffer overflow which can be triggered by an attacker via a crafted VOC
header (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1788">CVE-2009-1788</a>).</p>

<p>The vendor discovered that the  AIFF parsing routines suffer of a heap-based
buffer overflow similar to <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1788">CVE-2009-1788</a> which can be triggered by an attacker
via a crafted AIFF header (<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1791">CVE-2009-1791</a>).</p>

<p>In both cases the overflowing data is not completely attacker controlled but
still leads to application crashes or under some circumstances might still
lead to arbitrary code execution.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.16-2+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.17-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.20-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libsndfile packages.</p>
