<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in nagios2, a host/service/network
monitoring and management system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>


<p>Several cross-site scripting issues via several parameters were
discovered in the CGI scripts, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary
HTML code. In order to cover the different attack vectors, these issues
have been assigned <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5624">CVE-2007-5624</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-5803">CVE-2007-5803</a> and <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1360">CVE-2008-1360</a>.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-2+etch4.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (lenny) does not include nagios2, and nagios3 is
not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>The testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution (sid)
do not contain nagios2, and nagios3 is not affected by these problems.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nagios2 packages.</p>
