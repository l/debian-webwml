<p>Josh Triplett discovered that the blacklist for potentially harmful TeX
code of the teximg module of the Ikiwiki wiki compiler was incomplete,
resulting in information disclosure.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (etch) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.53.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1415926.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ikiwiki package.</p>
