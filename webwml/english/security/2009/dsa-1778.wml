<define-tag description>insufficient input sanitization</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that mahara, an electronic portfolio, weblog, and
resume builder, is prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks because
of missing input sanitization of the introduction text field in user
profiles and any text field in a user view.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain mahara.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
