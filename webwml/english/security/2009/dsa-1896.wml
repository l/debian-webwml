<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the opensaml and
shibboleth-sp packages, as used by Shibboleth 1.x:</p>

<ul>

<li><p>Chris Ries discovered that decoding a crafted URL leads to a crash
(and potentially, arbitrary code execution).</p></li>

<li><p>Ian Young discovered that embedded NUL characters in certificate names
were not correctly handled, exposing configurations using PKIX trust
validation to impersonation attacks.</p></li>

<li><p>Incorrect processing of SAML metadata ignored key usage constraints.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3f.dfsg1-2+etch1 of the shibboleth-sp packages, and
version 1.1a-2+etch1 of the opensaml packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.1.dfsg1-3+lenny1 of the shibboleth-sp packages, and
version 1.1.1-2+lenny1 of the opensaml packages.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain Shibboleth 1.x
packages.</p>

<p>This update requires restarting the affected services (mainly Apache)
to become effective.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Shibboleth 1.x packages.</p>
