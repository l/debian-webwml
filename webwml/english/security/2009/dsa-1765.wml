<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in horde3, the horde web application
framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0932">CVE-2009-0932</a>

<p>Gunnar Wrobel discovered a directory traversal vulnerability, which
allows attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via the
driver parameter in Horde_Image.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-3330">CVE-2008-3330</a>

<p>It was discovered that an attacker could perform a cross-site scripting
attack via the contact name, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary
html code. This requires that the attacker has access to create
contacts.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2008-5917">CVE-2008-5917</a>

<p>It was discovered that the horde XSS filter is prone to a cross-site
scripting attack, which allows attackers to inject arbitrary html code.
This is only exploitable when Internet Explorer is used.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.1.3-4etch5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.2+debian0-2, which was already included in the lenny
release.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 3.2.2+debian0-2.</p>
