<define-tag description>denial of service/execution of arbitrary code</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>In MySQL 4.0.0 through 5.0.83, multiple format string vulnerabilities
in the dispatch_command() function in libmysqld/sql_parse.cc in mysqld
allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon
crash) and potentially the execution of arbitrary code via format
string specifiers in a database name in a COM_CREATE_DB or 
COM_DROP_DB request.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.51a-24+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.32-7etch11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.</p>
