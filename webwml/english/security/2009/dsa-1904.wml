<p>Daniel Stenberg discovered that wget, a network utility to retrieve files from
the Web using HTTP(S) and FTP, is vulnerable to the "Null Prefix Attacks Against
SSL/TLS Certificates" published at the Blackhat conference some time ago.  This
allows an attacker to perform undetected man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted
ITU-T X.509 certificate with an injected null byte in the Common Name field.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.2-2+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.11.4-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the  unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.</p>
