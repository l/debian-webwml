<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Laurent Almeras and Guillaume Smet have discovered a possible SQL
injection vulnerability and cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in
gforge, a collaborative development tool. Due to insufficient input
sanitising, it was possible to inject arbitrary SQL statements and use
several parameters to conduct cross-site scripting attacks.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problem have been fixed in
version 4.7~rc2-7lenny1.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.14-22etch11.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.3-2.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gforge packages.</p>
