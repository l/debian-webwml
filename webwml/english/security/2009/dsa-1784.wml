<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered several integer overflows in FreeType, a library
to process and access font files, resulting in heap- or stack-based
buffer overflows leading to application crashes or the execution
of arbitrary code via a crafted font file.</p>


<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.1-5+etch4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.7-2+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.9-4.1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
