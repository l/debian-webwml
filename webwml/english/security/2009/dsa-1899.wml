<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in strongswan, an
implementation of the IPSEC and IKE protocols.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1957">CVE-2009-1957</a>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1958">CVE-2009-1958</a>

<p>The charon daemon can crash when processing certain crafted IKEv2
packets.  (The old stable distribution (etch) was not affected by
these two problems because it lacks IKEv2 support.)</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2185">CVE-2009-2185</a>
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-2661">CVE-2009-2661</a>

<p>The pluto daemon could crash when processing a crafted X.509
certificate.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.8.0+dfsg-1+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.4-5+lenny3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.2-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
