<define-tag description>insecure module search path</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that the ocsinventory-agent which is part of the
ocsinventory suite, a hardware and software configuration indexing service,
is prone to an insecure perl module search path.  As the agent is started
via cron and the current directory (/ in this case) is included in the
default perl module path the agent scans every directory on the system
for its perl modules.  This enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code
via a crafted ocsinventory-agent perl module placed on the system.</p>


<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain ocsinventory-agent.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-4lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.0.9.2repack1-5.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ocsinventory-agent packages.</p>
