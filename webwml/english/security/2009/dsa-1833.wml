<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in ISC's DHCP
implementation:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-0692">CVE-2009-0692</a>
<p>It was discovered that dhclient does not properly handle overlong
subnet mask options, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow and
possible arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2009-1892">CVE-2009-1892</a>
<p>Christoph Biedl discovered that the DHCP server may terminate when
receiving certain well-formed DHCP requests, provided that the server
configuration mixes host definitions using "dhcp-client-identifier"
and "hardware ethernet".  This vulnerability only affects the lenny
versions of dhcp3-server and dhcp3-server-ldap.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.0.4-13+etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-6+lenny2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 packages.</p>
