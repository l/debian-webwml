<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Tielei Wang has discovered an integer overflow in wxWidgets, the wxWidgets
Cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit, which allows the execution of arbitrary
code via a crafted JPEG file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.4.5.1.1+etch1 for wxwindows2.4 and version 2.6.3.2.1.5+etch1 for
wxwidgets2.6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in version
2.6.3.2.2-3+lenny1 for wxwidgets2.6 and version 2.8.7.1-1.1+lenny1 for
wxwidgets2.8.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.7.1-2 for wxwidgets2.8 and will be fixed soon for
wxwidgets2.6.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wxwidgets packages.</p>
