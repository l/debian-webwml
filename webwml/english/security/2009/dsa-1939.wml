<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Lucas Adamski, Matthew Gregan, David Keeler, and Dan Kaminsky discovered
that libvorbis, a library for the Vorbis general-purpose compressed
audio codec, did not correctly handle certain malformed ogg files. An
attacher could cause a denial of service (memory corruption and
application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .ogg
file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2.dfsg-1.4+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.0.dfsg-3.1+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), these problems have been fixed in version 1.2.3-1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvorbis packages.</p>
