<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in mahara, an electronic portfolio,
weblog, and resume builder.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3298">CVE-2009-3298</a>

<p>Ruslan Kabalin discovered a issue with resetting passwords, which could
lead to a privilege escalation of an institutional administrator
account.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3299">CVE-2009-3299</a>

<p>Sven Vetsch discovered a cross-site scripting vulnerability via the
resume fields.</p></li>

</ul>


<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.4-4+lenny4.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (etch) does not contain mahara.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mahara packages.</p>
