<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the client part of OpenAFS, a
distributed file system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1251">CVE-2009-1251</a>
<p>An attacker with control of a file server or the ability to forge RX
packets may be able to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode on an
OpenAFS client, due to a vulnerability in XDR array decoding.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1250">CVE-2009-1250</a>
<p>An attacker with control of a file server or the ability to forge RX
packets may crash OpenAFS clients because of wrongly handled error
return codes in the kernel module.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Note that in order to apply this security update, you must rebuild the
OpenAFS kernel module.  Be sure to also upgrade openafs-modules-source,
build a new kernel module for your system following the instructions in
/usr/share/doc/openafs-client/README.modules.gz, and then either stop
and restart openafs-client or reboot the system to reload the kernel
module.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.2-6etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.7.dfsg1-6+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10+dfsg1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.</p>
