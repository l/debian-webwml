<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michael Brooks discovered that phpMyAdmin, a tool to administrate MySQL
over the web, performs insufficient input sanitising allowing a user
assisted remote attacker to execute code on the webserver.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in version
2.9.1.1-10.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny) and unstable distribution (sid), this
problem has been fixed in version 2.11.8.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpmyadmin package.</p>
