<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matt Lewis discovered that Subversion performs insufficient input
validation of svndiff streams.  Malicious servers could cause heap
overflows in clients, and malicious clients with commit access could
cause heap overflows in servers, possibly leading to arbitrary code
execution in both cases.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2dfsg1-3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1dfsg1-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.4dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Subversion packages.</p>
