<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the imagemagick image
manipulation programs which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
exposure of sensitive information or cause DoS. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1667">CVE-2007-1667</a>

   <p>Multiple integer overflows in XInitImage function in xwd.c for
   ImageMagick, allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (crash) or obtain sensitive information via crafted images with
   large or negative values that trigger a buffer overflow. It only affects
   the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-1797">CVE-2007-1797</a>

   <p>Multiple integer overflows allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted DCM image, or the colors or comments field in a 
   crafted XWD image. It only affects the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4985">CVE-2007-4985</a>

   <p>A crafted image file can trigger an infinite loop in the ReadDCMImage
   function or in the ReadXCFImage function. It only affects the oldstable
   distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4986">CVE-2007-4986</a>

   <p>Multiple integer overflows allow context-dependent attackers to execute
   arbitrary code via a crafted .dcm, .dib, .xbm, .xcf, or .xwd image file,
   which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. It only affects the  
   oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4987">CVE-2007-4987</a>

   <p>Off-by-one error allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary
   code via a crafted image file, which triggers the writing of a '\0'
   character to an out-of-bounds address. It affects only the oldstable
   distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2007-4988">CVE-2007-4988</a>

   <p>A sign extension error allows context-dependent attackers to execute   
   arbitrary code via a crafted width value in an image file, which 
   triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow. It 
   affects only the oldstable distribution (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1096">CVE-2008-1096</a>

   <p>The load_tile function in the XCF coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary 
   code via a crafted .xcf file that triggers an out-of-bounds heap write.
   It affects only to oldstable (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2008-1097">CVE-2008-1097</a>

   <p>Heap-based buffer overflow in the PCX coder allows user-assisted remote
   attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary 
   code via a crafted .pcx file that triggers incorrect memory allocation 
   for the scanline array, leading to memory corruption. It affects only to
   oldstable (etch).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1882">CVE-2009-1882</a>

   <p>Integer overflow allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
   (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file, 
   which triggers a buffer overflow.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.2.4.5.dfsg1-0.15+etch1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), these problems have been fixed in
version 7:6.3.7.9.dfsg2-1~lenny3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (squeeze) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version
7:6.5.1.0-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
