<define-tag description>missing escape function</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>It was discovered that pygresql, a PostgreSQL module for Python, was
missing a function to call PQescapeStringConn(). This is needed, because
PQescapeStringConn() honours the charset of the connection and prevents
insufficient escaping, when certain multibyte character encodings are
used. The new function is called pg_escape_string(), which takes the
database connection as a first argument. The old function
escape_string() has been preserved as well for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>Developers using these bindings are encouraged to adjust their code to
use the new function.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.8.1-1etch2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (lenny), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.8.1-3+lenny1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (squeeze) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1:4.0-1.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pygresql packages.</p>
