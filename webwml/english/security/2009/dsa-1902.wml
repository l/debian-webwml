<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Wilk discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in the charset 
handling of elinks, a feature-rich text-mode WWW browser, which might
lead to the execution of arbitrary code if the user is tricked into
opening a malformed HTML page.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.11.1-1.2etch2.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (lenny) and the unstable distribution (sid)
already contain a patch for this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your elinks package.</p>
