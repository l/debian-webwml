<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Spike Spiegel discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in gmetad, the
meta-daemon for the ganglia cluster monitoring toolkit, which could be
triggered via a request with long path names and might enable
arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.7-3.1etch1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.7-5.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (lenny), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ganglia-monitor-core packages.</p>
