    <p>Oleg Nesterov discovered an issue in the exit_notify function that
    allows local users to send an arbitrary signal to a process by
    running a program that modifies the exit_signal field and then
    uses an exec system call to launch a setuid application.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-1439">CVE-2009-1439</a>

    <p>Pavan Naregundi reported an issue in the CIFS filesystem code that
    allows remote users to overwrite memory via a long
    nativeFileSystem field in a Tree Connect response during mount.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (etch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.18.dfsg.1-24etch2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6, fai-kernels, and
user-mode-linux packages.</p>

<p>Note: Debian carefully tracks all known security issues across every
linux kernel package in all releases under active security support.
However, given the high frequency at which low-severity security
issues are discovered in the kernel and the resource requirements of
doing an update, updates for lower priority issues will normally not
be released for all kernels at the same time. Rather, they will be
released in a staggered or "leap-frog" fashion.</p>
