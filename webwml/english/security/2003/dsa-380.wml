<p>Four vulnerabilities have been discovered in XFree86.</p>

<ul>

- xterm window title reporting escape sequence can deceive user

<p>The xterm package provides a terminal escape sequence that reports
  the window title by injecting it into the input buffer of the
  terminal window, as if the user had typed it.  An attacker can craft
  an escape sequence that sets the title of a victim's xterm window to
  an arbitrary string (such as a shell command) and then reports that
  title.  If the victim is at a shell prompt when this is done, the
  injected command will appear on the command line, ready to be run.
  Since it is not possible to embed a carriage return in the window
  title, the attacker would have to convince the victim to press Enter
  (or rely upon the victim's careless or confusion) for the shell or
  other interactive process to interpret the window title as user
  input.  It is conceivable that the attacker could craft other escape
  sequences that might convince the victim to accept the injected
  input, however.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project at
  cve.mitre.org has assigned the name
  <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0063">CAN-2003-0063</a>
  to this issue.</p>

<p>To determine whether your version of xterm is vulnerable to abuse of
  the window title reporting feature, run the following command at a
  shell prompt from within an xterm window:</p>

<verbatim>
   echo -e "\e[21t"
</verbatim>

<p>(The terminal bell may ring, and the window title may be prefixed
  with an "l".)</p>

<p>This flaw is exploitable by anything that can send output to a
  terminal window, such as a text document.  The xterm user has to
  take action to cause the escape sequence to be sent, however (such
  as by viewing a malicious text document with the "cat" command).
  Whether you are likely to be exposed to it depends on how you use
  xterm.  Consider the following:</p>

<verbatim>
   echo -e '\e]2;s && echo rm -rf *\a' > /tmp/sploit
   echo -e '\e[21t' >> /tmp/sploit
   cat /tmp/sploit
</verbatim>

<p>Debian has resolved this problem by disabling the window title
  reporting escape sequence in xterm; it is understood but ignored.
  The escape sequence to set the window title has not been disabled.</p>

<p>A future release of the xterm package will have a configuration
  option to permit the user to turn the window title reporting feature
  back on, but it will default off.</p>

- xterm susceptible to DEC UDK escape sequence denial-of-service attack

<p>The xterm package, since it emulates DEC VT-series text terminals,
  emulates a feature of DEC VT terminals known as "User-Defined Keys"
  (UDK for short).  There is a bug in xterm's handling of DEC UDK
  escape sequences, however, and an ill-formed one can cause the xterm
  process to enter a tight loop.  This causes the process to "spin",
  consuming CPU cycles uselessly, and refusing to handle signals (such
  as efforts to kill the process or close the window).</p>

<p>To determine whether your version of xterm is vulnerable to this
  attack, run the following command at a shell prompt from within a
  "sacrificial" xterm window (i.e., one that doesn't have anything in
  the scrollback buffer you might need to see later):</p>

<verbatim>
   echo -e "\eP0;0|0A/17\x9c"
</verbatim>

<p>This flaw is exploitable by anything that can send output to a
  terminal window, such as a text document.  The xterm user has to
  take action to cause the escape sequence to be sent, however (such
  as by viewing a malicious text document with the "cat" command).
  Whether you are likely to be exposed to it depends on how you use
  xterm.</p>

<p>Debian has resolved this problem by backporting an upstream fix
  to XFree86 4.1.0.</p>

- flaw in X server's MIT-SHM extension permits user owning X session to read
and write arbitrary shared memory segments

<p>Most X servers descended from the MIT/X Consortium/X.Org Sample
  Implementation, including XFree86's X servers, support an extension
  to the X protocol called MIT-SHM, which enables X clients running on
  the same host as the X server to operate more quickly and
  efficiently by taking advantage of an operating system feature
  called shared memory where it is available.  The Linux kernel, for
  example, supports shared memory.</p>

<p>Because the X server runs with elevated privileges, the operating
  system's built-in access control mechanisms are ineffective to
  police the X server's usage of segments of shared memory.  The X
  server has to implement its own access control.  This was
  imperfectly done in previous releases of XFree86 (and the MIT/X
  Consortium/X.Org Sample Implementation before it), leaving
  opportunities for malicious X clients to read and alter shared
  memory segments to which they should not have access.  The Common
  Vulnerabilities and Exposures project at cve.mitre.org has assigned
  the name
  <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0164">CAN-2002-0164</a>
  to this issue.</p>

<p>Debian's XFree86 4.1.0-16 packages shipped with an incomplete fix
  for the this flaw, only enforcing proper access control for X
  servers that were not started by a display manager (e.g., xdm).
  This update resolves that problem.</p>

<p>The Debian Project knows of no exploits for this vulnerability.  A
  malicious X client that abused the MIT-SHM extension could
  conceivably be written however, and run (deliberately or
  unwittingly) by a user able to run an X server on a host.  The
  impact of this flaw depends on how shared memory is used on the
  system.  See the ipcs(8) manual page for more information.</p>

  XFree86 4.1.0.</p>

- multiple integer overflows in the font libraries for XFree86 allow local or
remote attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via
heap-based and stack-based buffer overflow attacks

<p>Security researcher "blexim" wrote [paraphrased]:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have identified several bugs in the font libraries of the
  current version of the XFree86 source code.  These bugs could
  potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code by a remote
  user in any process which calls the functions in question.  The
  functions are related to the transfer and enumeration of fonts
  from font servers to clients, limiting the range of the exposure
  caused by these bugs.</p>

<p>Specifically, several sizing variables passed from a font server
  to a client are not adequately checked, causing calculations on
  them to result in erroneous values.  These erroneous calculations
  can lead to buffers on the heap and stack overflowing, potentially
  leading to arbitrary code execution.  As stated before, the risk
  is limited by the fact that only clients can be affected by these
  bugs, but in some (non-default) configurations, both xfs and the X
  server can act as clients to remote font servers.  In these
  configurations, both xfs and the X server could be potentially
  compromised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project at cve.mitre.org
  has assigned the name
  <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0730">CAN-2003-0730</a>
  to this issue.</p>

<p>The Debian Project knows of no exploits for this vulnerability.  By
  default in Debian, X servers are configured to listen only to a
  locally-running font server, which is not even used if the xfs
  package is not installed.  The Debian default configuration of xfs
  uses only font directories on the local host, and does not attempt
  to connect to any external font servers.</p>

<p>Debian has resolved this problem by backporting an upstream fix to
  XFree86 4.1.0.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above problems also affect the xfree86v3 packages (in the
case of the first two flaws, the xterm source code contains the flaws,
but no xterm package is produced).  Due to resource limitations and a
lack of upstream support for this legacy code, Debian is unable to
continue supporting version 3.3.6 of XFree86.  To avoid exposure to
the latter two flaws in this advisory, we recommend that you remove
the following packages if you have them installed:</p>

<ul>
<li>xserver-3dlabs</li>
<li>xserver-8514</li>
<li>xserver-agx</li>
<li>xserver-common-v3</li>
<li>xserver-fbdev</li>
<li>xserver-i128</li>
<li>xserver-mach32</li>
<li>xserver-mach64</li>
<li>xserver-mach8</li>
<li>xserver-mono</li>
<li>xserver-p9000</li>
<li>xserver-s3</li>
<li>xserver-s3v</li>
<li>xserver-svga</li>
<li>xserver-tga</li>
<li>xserver-vga16</li>
<li>xserver-w32</li>
</ul>

<p>(You may also wish to remove the xext, xlib6, and xlib6-altdev packages,
as support for them is being terminated along with the rest of the
XFree86 3.3.6 packages, though they are not affected by the flaws in
this advisory.)</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.0-16woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) all problems except
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0730">CAN-2003-0730</a>
are fixed in version 4.2.1-11.
<a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0730">CAN-2003-0730</a>
will be fixed in 4.2.1-12, currently in preparation.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xfree86 package.</p>
