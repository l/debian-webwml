<p>The developers of tomcat discovered several problems in tomcat version
3.x.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0042">\
   CAN-2003-0042</a>: A maliciously crafted request could return a
   directory listing even when an index.html, index.jsp, or other
   welcome file is present.  File contents can be returned as well.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0043">\
   CAN-2003-0043</a>: A malicious web application could read the contents
   of some files outside the web application via its web.xml file in
   spite of the presence of a security manager.  The content of files
   that can be read as part of an XML document would be accessible.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0044">\
   CAN-2003-0044</a>: A cross-site scripting vulnerability was discovered
   in the included sample web application that allows remote attackers
   to execute arbitrary script code.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3a-4.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain tomcat packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.1a-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat package.</p>
