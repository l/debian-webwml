<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a buffer overflow in the environment variable
handling of conquest, a curses based, real-time, multi-player space
warfare game, which could lead a local attacker to gain unauthorised
access to the group conquest.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.1.1-6woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.2-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your conquest package.</p>
