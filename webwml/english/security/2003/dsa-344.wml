<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A directory traversal vulnerability in UnZip 5.50 allows attackers to
bypass a check for relative pathnames ("../") by placing certain invalid
characters between the two "." characters.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your unzip package.</p>
