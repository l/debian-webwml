<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A directory traversal vulnerability in UnZip 5.50 allows attackers to
bypass a check for relative pathnames ("../") by placing certain invalid
characters between the two "." characters.  The fix which was
implemented in DSA-344-1 may not have protected against all methods of
exploiting this vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your unzip package.</p>
