<p>Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE security audit team found two problems
in samba, a popular SMB/CIFS implementation. The problems are:</p>

<ul>
<li> a buffer overflow in the SMB/CIFS packet fragment re-assembly code
  used by smbd.  Since smbd runs as root an attacker can use this to
  gain root access to a machine running smbd.</li>

<li> the code to write reg files was vulnerable for a chown race which made
  it possible for a local user to overwrite system files</li>
</ul>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in upstream version 2.2.8, and version
2.2.3a-12.1 of package for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody.</p>
