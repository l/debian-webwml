<define-tag description>ASN.1 parsing vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Henson of the OpenSSL core team identified and prepared fixes
for a number of vulnerabilities in the OpenSSL ASN1 code that were
discovered after running a test suite by British National
Infrastructure Security Coordination Centre (NISCC).</p>

<p>A bug in OpenSSLs SSL/TLS protocol was also identified which causes
OpenSSL to parse a client certificate from an SSL/TLS client when it
should reject it as a protocol error.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0543">CAN-2003-0543</a>:

<p>Integer overflow in OpenSSL that allows remote attackers to cause a
   denial of service (crash) via an SSL client certificate with
   certain ASN.1 tag values.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0544">CAN-2003-0544</a>:

<p>OpenSSL does not properly track the number of characters in certain
   ASN.1 inputs, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of
   service (crash) via an SSL client certificate that causes OpenSSL
   to read past the end of a buffer when the long form is used.</p>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0545">CAN-2003-0545</a>:

<p>Double-free vulnerability allows remote attackers to cause a denial
   of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL
   client certificate with a certain invalid ASN.1 encoding.  This bug
   was only present in OpenSSL 0.9.7 and is listed here only for
   reference.</p>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in openssl095 version 0.9.5a-6.woody.3.</p>

<p>This package is not present in the unstable (sid) or testing (sarge)
distribution.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libssl095a packages and restart
services using this library.  Debian doesn't ship any packages that
are linked against this library.</p>

<p>The following commandline (courtesy of Ray Dassen) produces a list of
names of running processes that have libssl095 mapped into their
memory space:</p>

<pre>
    find /proc -name maps -exec egrep -l 'libssl095' {} /dev/null \; \
    | sed -e 's/[^0-9]//g' | xargs --no-run-if-empty ps --no-headers -p | \
    sed -e 's/^\+//' -e 's/ \+/ /g' | cut -d ' ' -f 5 | sort | uniq</p>
</pre>

<p>You should restart the associated services.</p>
