<define-tag description>input validation bug</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The SuSE security team discovered during an audit a bug in
Mail::Mailer, a Perl module used for sending email, whereby
potentially untrusted input is passed to a program such as mailx,
which may interpret certain escape sequences as commands to be
executed.</p>

<p>This bug has been fixed by removing support for programs such as mailx
as a transport for sending mail.  Instead, alternative mechanisms are
used.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.44-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your libmailtools-perl package.</p>
