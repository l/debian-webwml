<define-tag description>infinite loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrew Griffiths and iDEFENSE Labs discovered a problem in tcpdump, a
powerful tool for network monitoring and data acquisition.  An
attacker is able to send a specially crafted network packet which
causes tcpdump to enter an infinite loop.</p>

<p>In addition to the above problem the tcpdump developers discovered a
potential infinite loop when parsing malformed BGP packets.  They also
discovered a buffer overflow that can be exploited with certain
malformed NFS packets.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.6.2-2.3.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected
by these problems.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.1-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump packages.</p>
