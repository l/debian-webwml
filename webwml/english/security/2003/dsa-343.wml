<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>skk (Simple Kana to Kanji conversion program), does not take
appropriate security precautions when creating temporary files.  This
bug could potentially be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files with
the privileges of the user running Emacs and skk.</p>

<p>ddskk is derived from the same code, and contains the same bug.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
skk version 10.62a-4woody1 and ddskk version 11.6.rel.0-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
ddskk version 12.1.cvs.20030622-1, and skk will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your skk and ddskk packages.</p>
