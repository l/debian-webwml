<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>webfs, a lightweight HTTP server for static content, contains a buffer
overflow whereby a long Request-URI in an HTTP request could cause
arbitrary code to be executed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a webfs package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your webfs package.</p>
