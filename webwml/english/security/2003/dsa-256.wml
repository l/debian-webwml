<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in adb2mhc from the mhc-utils package.  The
default temporary directory uses a predictable name.  This adds a
vulnerability that allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary
files the users has write permissions for.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.25+20010625-7.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) does not contain mhc
packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.25+20030224-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mhc-utils packages.</p>
