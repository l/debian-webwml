<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered several problems in ircII, a popular
client for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious server could
craft special reply strings, triggering the client to write beyond
buffer boundaries.  This could lead to a denial of service if the
client only crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary code
under the user id of the chatting user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 20020322-1.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been
fixed in version 4.4M-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 20030315-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ircII package.</p>
