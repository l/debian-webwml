<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Georgi Guninski discovered a problem in ethereal, a network traffic
analyzer.  The program contains a format string vulnerability that
could probably lead to execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody3.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected
by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.9-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
