<p>Dan Jacobson noticed a problem in noffle, an offline news server, that
leads to a segmentation fault.  It is not yet clear whether this
problem is exploitable.  However, if it is, a remote attacker could
trigger arbitrary code execution under the user that calls noffle,
probably news.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a noffle
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your noffle package.</p>
