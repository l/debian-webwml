<p>Multiple <a href="http://www.idefense.com/advisory/12.19.02.txt">\
vulnerabilities</a> were discovered in the Common Unix Printing
System (CUPS).  Several of these issues represent the potential for a
remote compromise or denial of service.  The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1383">\
   CAN-2002-1383</a>: Multiple integer overflows allow a remote attacker
   to execute arbitrary code via the CUPSd HTTP interface and the
   image handling code in CUPS filters.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1366">\
   CAN-2002-1366</a>: Race conditions in connection with <code>/etc/cups/certs/</code>
   allow local users with lp privileges to create or overwrite
   arbitrary files.  This is not present in the potato version.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1367">\
   CAN-2002-1367</a>: This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to add
   printers without authentication via a certain UDP packet, which can
   then be used to perform unauthorized activities such as stealing
   the local root certificate for the administration server via a
   "need authorization" page.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1368">\
   CAN-2002-1368</a>: Negative lengths fed into memcpy() can cause a
   denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1369">\
   CAN-2002-1369</a>: An unsafe strncat() function call processing the
   options string allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code
   via a buffer overflow.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1371">\
   CAN-2002-1371</a>: Zero width images allows a remote attacker to
   execute arbitrary code via modified chunk headers.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1372">\
   CAN-2002-1372</a>: CUPS does not properly check the return values of
   various file and socket operations, which could allow a remote
   attacker to cause a denial of service.</li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1384">\
   CAN-2002-1384</a>: The cupsys package contains some code from the xpdf
   package, used to convert PDF files for printing, which contains an
   exploitable integer overflow bug.  This is not present in the
   potato version.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though we tried very hard to fix all problems in the packages for
potato as well, the packages may still contain other security related
problems.  Hence, we advise users of potato systems using CUPS to
upgrade to woody soon.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.14-4.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.4-12.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS packages immediately.</p>
