<define-tag description>local privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The kernel module loader in Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4 kernels has a flaw
in ptrace.  This hole allows local users to obtain root privileges by
using ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the
kernel.  Remote exploitation of this hole is not possible.</p>

<p>This advisory only covers kernel packages for the big and little endian MIPS
architectures.  Other architectures will be covered by separate advisories.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in version
2.4.17-0.020226.2.woody1 of kernel-patch-2.4.17-mips (mips+mipsel) and in
version 2.4.19-0.020911.1.woody1 of kernel-patch-2.4.19-mips (mips only).</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem
for these architectures since mips and mipsel were first released with
Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody).</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.19-0.020911.6 of kernel-patch-2.4.19-mips (mips+mipsel).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel-images packages immediately.</p>
