<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Joey Hess discovered that fuzz, a software stress-testing tool,
creates a temporary file without taking appropriate security
precautions.  This bug could allow an attacker to gain the privileges
of the user invoking fuzz, excluding root (fuzz does not allow itself
to be invoked as root).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6-6woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a fuzz package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your fuzz package.</p>
