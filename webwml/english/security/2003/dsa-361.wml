<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in kdelibs:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0459">CAN-2003-0459</a>: KDE Konqueror for KDE 3.1.2 and earlier does not
  remove authentication credentials from URLs of the
  "user:password@host" form in the HTTP-Referer header, which could
  allow remote web sites to steal the credentials for pages that link
  to the sites.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0370">CAN-2003-0370</a>: Konqueror Embedded and KDE 2.2.2 and earlier does not
  validate the Common Name (CN) field for X.509 Certificates, which
  could allow remote attackers to spoof certificates via a
  man-in-the-middle attack.</li>
</ul>

<p>These vulnerabilities are described in the following security
advisories from KDE:</p>

 <li><url http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030602-1.txt>
</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 2.2.2-13.woody.8 of kdelibs and 2.2.2-6woody2 of
kdelibs-crypto.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
kdelibs version 4:3.1.3-1. The unstable distribution does not contain
a separate kdelibs-crypto package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your kdelibs and kdelibs-crypto 
packages.</p>
