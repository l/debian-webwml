<p>Digital Defense, Inc. has alerted the Samba Team to a serious
vulnerability in Samba, a LanManager-like file and printer server for Unix.
This vulnerability can lead to an anonymous user gaining root access
on a Samba serving system.  An exploit for this problem is already
circulating and in use.</p>

<p>Since the packags for potato are quite old it is likely that they
contain more security-relevant bugs that we know of.  You are
# Shouldn't that be "that we don't know of"?
therefore advised to upgrade your systems running Samba to woody
soon.</p>

<p>Unofficial backported packages from the Samba maintainers for version
2.2.8 of Samba for woody are available at
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~peloy/">~peloy</a> and
<a href="http://people.debian.org/~vorlon/">~vorlon</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3a-12.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-5.1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected since it contains
version 3.0 packages already.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Samba packages immediately.</p>
