<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Orville Write, a replacement for the standard write(1) command,
contains a number of buffer overflows.  These could be exploited to
gain either gid tty or root privileges, depending on the configuration
selected when the package is installed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.53-4woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain an orville-write
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
See Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/170747">bug report #170747</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your orville-write package.</p>
