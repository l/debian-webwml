<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Rick Patel discovered that atftpd is vulnerable to a buffer overflow
when a long filename is sent to the server.  An attacker could exploit
this bug remotely to execute arbitrary code on the server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.1.1.0woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain an atftp
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your atftp package.</p>
