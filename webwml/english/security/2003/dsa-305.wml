<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo discovered bugs in three scripts included in the sendmail
package where temporary files were created insecurely (expn,
checksendmail and doublebounce.pl).  These bugs could allow an
attacker to gain the privileges of a user invoking the script
(including root).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 8.12.3-6.4.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been fixed
in version 8.9.3-26.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 8.12.9-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your sendmail package.</p>
