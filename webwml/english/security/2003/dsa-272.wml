<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>eEye Digital Security discovered an integer overflow in the
xdrmem_getbytes() function of glibc, that is also present in dietlibc,
a small libc useful especially for small and embedded systems.  This
function is part of the XDR encoder/decoder derived from Sun's RPC
implementation.  Depending upon the application, this vulnerability
can cause buffer overflows and could possibly be exploited to execute
arbitray code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.12-2.5.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain dietlibc
packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.22-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dietlibc packages.</p>
