<p>CAN-2003-0073: The mysql package contains a bug whereby dynamically
allocated memory is freed more than once, which could be deliberately
triggered by an attacker to cause a crash, resulting in a denial of
service condition.  In order to exploit this vulnerability, a valid
username and password combination for access to the MySQL server is
required.</p>

<p>CAN-2003-0150: The mysql package contains a bug whereby a malicious
user, granted certain permissions within mysql, could create a
configuration file which would cause the mysql server to run as root,
or any other user, rather than the mysql user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) both problems have been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.4.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is only affected by
CAN-2003-0150, and this has been fixed in version 3.22.32-6.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), CAN-2003-0073 was fixed in
version 4.0.12-2, and CAN-2003-0150 will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mysql package.</p>
