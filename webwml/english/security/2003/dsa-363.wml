<define-tag description>denial of service, bounce-scanning</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The postfix mail transport agent in Debian 3.0 contains two
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0468">\
  CAN-2003-0468</a>: Postfix would allow an attacker to bounce-scan private
  networks or use the daemon as a DDoS tool by forcing the daemon to
  connect to an arbitrary service at an arbitrary IP address and
  either receiving a bounce message or observing queue operations to
  infer the status of the delivery attempt.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0540">\
  CAN-2003-0540</a>: a malformed envelope address can 1) cause the queue
  manager to lock up until an entry is removed from the queue and 2)
  lock up the smtp listener leading to a denial of service.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.1.11-0.woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your postfix package.</p>
