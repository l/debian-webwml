<p>Stefan Esser <a href="http://security.e-matters.de/advisories/012003.html">\
discovered</a> a problem in cvs, a concurrent versions
system, which is used for many Free Software projects.  The current
version contais a flaw that can be used by a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the CVS server under the user id the CVS
server runs as.  Anonymous read-only access is sufficient to exploit
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.11.1p1debian-8.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.10.7-9.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cvs package immediately.</p>
