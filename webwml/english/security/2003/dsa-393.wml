<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Dr. Stephen Henson (steve@openssl.org), using a test suite provided by
NISCC (www.niscc.gov.uk), discovered a number of errors in the OpenSSL
ASN1 code.  Combined with an error that causes the OpenSSL code to parse
client certificates even when it should not, these errors can cause a
denial of service (DoS) condition on a system using the OpenSSL code,
depending on how that code is used. For example, even though apache-ssl
and ssh link to OpenSSL libraries, they should not be affected by this
vulnerability. However, other SSL-enabled applications may be
vulnerable and an OpenSSL upgrade is recommended.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 0.9.6c-2.woody.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.7c-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your openssl package. Note that you will
need to restart services which use the libssl library for this update
to take effect.</p>
