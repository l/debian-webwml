<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>acm, a multi-player aerial combat simulation, uses a network protocol
based on the same RPC implementation used in many C libraries.  This
implementation was found to contain an integer overflow vulnerability
which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0-3.woody.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your acm package.</p>
