<define-tag description>failure to drop root privileges</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>tcptraceroute is a setuid-root program which drops root privileges
after obtaining a file descriptor used for raw packet capture.
However, it did not fully relinquish all privileges, and in the event
of an exploitable vulnerability, root privileges could be regained.</p>

<p>No current exploit is known, but this safeguard is being repaired in
order to provide a measure of containment in the event that an
exploitable flaw should be discovered.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a tcptraceroute
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
1.4-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your tcptraceroute package.</p>
