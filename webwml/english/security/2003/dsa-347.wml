<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>teapop, a POP-3 server, includes modules for authenticating users
against a PostgreSQL or MySQL database.  These modules do not properly
escape user-supplied strings before using them in SQL queries.  This
vulnerability could be exploited to execute arbitrary SQL code under the
privileges of the database user as which teapop has authenticated.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.4-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your teapop package.</p>
