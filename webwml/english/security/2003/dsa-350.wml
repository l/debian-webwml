<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The falconseye package is vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploited
via a long <kbd>-s</kbd> command line option.  This vulnerability could be used
by an attacker to gain gid 'games' on a system where falconseye is
installed.</p>

<p>Note that falconseye does not contain the file permission error
CAN-2003-0359 which affected some other nethack packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-7woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your falconseye package.</p>
