<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The transparent session ID feature in the php4 package does not
properly escape user-supplied input before inserting it into the
generated HTML page.  An attacker could use this vulnerability to
execute embedded scripts within the context of the generated page.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4:4.1.2-6woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/200736">bug #200736</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your php4 package.</p>
