<define-tag description>ignored counter boundary</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Lohoff discovered a bug in the dhcrelay causing it to send a
continuing packet storm towards the configured DHCP server(s) in case
of a malicious BOOTP packet, such as sent from buggy Cisco switches.</p>

<p>When the dhcp-relay receives a BOOTP request it forwards the request
to the DHCP server using the broadcast MAC address ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
which causes the network interface to reflect the packet back into the
socket.  To prevent loops the dhcrelay checks whether the
relay-address is its own, in which case the packet would be dropped.
In combination with a missing upper boundary for the hop counter an
attacker can force the dhcp-relay to send a continuing packet storm
towards the configured dhcp server(s).</p>

<p>This patch introduces a new commandline switch <kbd>-c maxcount</kbd> and
people are advised to start the dhcp-relay with <kbd>dhcrelay -c 10</kbd>
or a smaller number, which will only create that many packets.</p>

<p>The dhcrelay program from the "dhcp" package does not seem to be
affected since DHCP packets are dropped if they were apparently
relayed already.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0+3.0.1rc9-2.2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain dhcp3 packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3 package when you are using
the dhcrelay server.</p>
