<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Byrial Jensen discovered a couple of off-by-one buffer overflow in the
IMAP code of Mutt, a text-oriented mail reader supporting IMAP, MIME,
GPG, PGP and threading.  This problem could potentially allow a remote
malicious IMAP server to cause a denial of service (crash) and
possibly execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted mail folder.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.28-2.2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is also affected by this problem
and an update will follow.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.0 and above.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mutt package.</p>
