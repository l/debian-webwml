<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Leonard Stiles discovered that lv, a multilingual file viewer, would
read options from a configuration file in the current directory.
Because such a file could be placed there by a malicious user, and lv
configuration options can be used to execute commands, this
represented a security vulnerability.  An attacker could gain the
privileges of the user invoking lv, including root.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.49.4-7woody2.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 4.49.3-4potato2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
4.49.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your lv package.</p>
