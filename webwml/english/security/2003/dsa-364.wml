<define-tag description>buffer overflows, arbitrary command execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>man-db provides the standard man(1) command on Debian systems.  During
configuration of this package, the administrator is asked whether
man(1) should run setuid to a dedicated user ("man") in order to
provide a shared cache of preformatted manual pages.  The default is
for man(1) NOT to be setuid, and in this configuration no known
vulnerability exists.  However, if the user explicitly requests setuid
operation, a local attacker could exploit either of the following bugs to
execute arbitrary code as the "man" user.</p>

<p>Again, these vulnerabilities do not affect the default configuration,
where man is not setuid.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0620">CAN-2003-0620</a>: Multiple buffer overflows in man-db 2.4.1 and
  earlier, when installed setuid, allow local users to gain privileges
  via (1) MANDATORY_MANPATH, MANPATH_MAP, and MANDB_MAP arguments to
  add_to_dirlist in manp.c, (2) a long pathname to ult_src in
  ult_src.c, (3) a long .so argument to test_for_include in ult_src.c,
  (4) a long MANPATH environment variable, or (5) a long PATH
  environment variable.</li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0645">CAN-2003-0645</a>: Certain DEFINE directives in <code>~/.manpath</code>, which
  contained commands to be executed, would be honored even when
  running setuid, allowing any user to execute commands as the
  "man" user.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.3.20-18.woody.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.1-13.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your man-db package.</p>
