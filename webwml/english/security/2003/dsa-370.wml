writing a log message.  This vulnerability may allow an attacker to
execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the program requesting
PAM authentication.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
