<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer
(SSL) implementation.  In an upcoming paper, Brice Canvel (EPFL),
Alain Hiltgen (UBS), Serge Vaudenay (EPFL), and Martin Vuagnoux (EPFL,
Ilion) describe and demonstrate a timing-based attack on CBC cipher
suites used in SSL and TLS.  OpenSSL has been found to be vulnerable to
this attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.9.6c-2.woody.2.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 0.9.6c-0.potato.5.  Please note that this updates the
version from potato-proposed-updates that supersedes the version in
potato.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7a-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
