<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Karol Lewandowski discovered that psbanner, a printer filter that
creates a PostScript format banner and is part of LPRng, insecurely
creates a temporary file for debugging purpose when it is configured
as filter.  The program does not check whether this file already
exists or is linked to another place writes its current environment
and called arguments to the file unconditionally with the user id
daemon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.10-1.2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.20-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lprng package.</p>
