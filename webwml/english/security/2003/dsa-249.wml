<define-tag description>missing HTML quoting</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hironori Sakamoto, one of the w3m developers, found two security
vulnerabilities in w3m and associated programs.  The w3m browser does
not properly escape HTML tags in frame contents and img alt
attributes.  A malicious HTML frame or img alt attribute may deceive a
user to send their local cookies which are used for configuration.  The
information is not leaked automatically, though.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.p23.3-1.5.  Please note that the update also contains an
important patch to make the program work on the powerpc platform again.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by these
problems.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.p24.17-3 and later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your w3mmee packages.</p>
