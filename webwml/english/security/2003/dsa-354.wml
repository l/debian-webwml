<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a buffer overflow in xconq, in processing the
USER environment variable.  In the process of fixing this bug, a
similar problem was discovered with the DISPLAY environment
variable.  This vulnerability could be exploited by a local attacker
to gain gid 'games'.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed
in version 7.4.1-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/202963">bug #202963</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xconq package.</p>
