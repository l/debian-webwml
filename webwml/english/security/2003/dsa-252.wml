<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in slocate, a secure locate replacement.
A buffer overflow in the setgid program slocate can be used to execute
arbitrary code as group slocate.  This can be used to alter the
slocate database.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.6-1.3.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your slocate package immediately.</p>
