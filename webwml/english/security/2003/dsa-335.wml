<p>mantis, a PHP/MySQL web based bug tracking system, stores the password
used to access its database in a configuration file which is
world-readable.  This could allow a local attacker to read the
password and gain read/write access to the database.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17.1-3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a mantis
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
0.17.5-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mantis package.</p>
