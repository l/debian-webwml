<define-tag description>insecure temporary file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo and Matt Zimmerman discovered two similar problems in
metrics, a tools for software metrics.  Two scripts in this package,
"halstead" and "gather_stats", open temporary files without taking
appropriate security precautions.  "halstead" is installed as a user
program, while "gather_stats" is only used in an auxiliary script
included in the source code.  These vulnerabilities could allow a
local attacker to overwrite files owned by the user running the
scripts, including root.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (woody) is not affected since it doesn't
contain a metrics package anymore.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0-1.1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected since it doesn't
contain a metrics package anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your metrics package.</p>
