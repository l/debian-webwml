<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Calle Dybedahl discovered a bug in lyskom-server which could result in
a denial of service where an unauthenticated user could cause the
server to become unresponsive as it processes a large query.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.6-1woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a lyskom-server package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
2.0.7-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your lyskom-server package.</p>
