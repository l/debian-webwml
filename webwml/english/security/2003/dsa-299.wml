<define-tag description>improper setuid-root execution</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Maurice Massar discovered that, due to a packaging error, the program
/usr/bin/KATAXWR was inadvertently installed setuid root.  This
program was not designed to run setuid, and contained multiple
vulnerabilities which could be exploited to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-3.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a leksbot
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your leksbot package.</p>
