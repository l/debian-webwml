<define-tag description>several vulnerabilities</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>xfstt, a TrueType font server for the X window system was found to
contain two classes of vulnerabilities:</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0581">\
  CAN-2003-0581</a>: a remote attacker could send requests crafted to
  trigger any of several buffer overruns, causing a denial of service or
  possibly executing arbitrary code on the server with the privileges
  of the "nobody" user.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0625">\
  CAN-2003-0625</a>: certain invalid data sent during the connection
  handshake could allow a remote attacker to read certain regions of
  memory belonging to the xfstt process.  This information could be
  used for fingerprinting, or to aid in exploitation of a different
  vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.2.1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), CAN-2003-0581 is fixed in xfstt
1.5-1, and CAN-2003-0625 will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xfstt package.</p>
