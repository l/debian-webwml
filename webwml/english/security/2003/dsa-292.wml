<define-tag description>insecure temporary file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Colin Phipps discovered several problems in mime-support, that contains
support programs for the MIME control files 'mime.types' and 'mailcap'.
When a temporary file is to be used it is created insecurely, allowing
an attacker to overwrite arbitrary under the user id of the person
executing run-mailcap.</p>

<p>When run-mailcap is executed on a file with a potentially
problematic filename, a temporary file is created (not insecurely
anymore), removed and a symbolic link to this filename is created.  An
attacker could recreate the file before the symbolic link is created,
forcing the display program to display different content.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.18-1.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.9-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been
fixed in version 3.23-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mime-support packages.</p>
