<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>mindi, a program for creating boot/root disks, does not take
appropriate security precautions when creating temporary files.  This
bug could potentially be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files with
the privileges of the user running mindi.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.58.r5-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/203825">bug #203825</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mindi package.</p>
