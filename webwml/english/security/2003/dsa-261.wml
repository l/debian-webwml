<define-tag description>infinite loop</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in tcpdump, a powerful tool for network
monitoring and data acquisition.  An attacker is able to send a
specially crafted RADIUS network packet which causes tcpdump to enter
an infinite loop.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 3.6.2-2.4.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected
by this problem.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem anymore.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tcpdump package.</p>
