<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jeremy Nelson discovered a remotely exploitable buffer overflow in
EPIC4, a popular client for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious
server could craft a reply which triggers the client to allocate a
negative amount of memory.  This could lead to a denial of service if
the client only crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary
code under the user id of the chatting user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2.20020219-2.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.11.20030409-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your epic4 package.</p>
