<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo discovered insecure creation of a temporary file in
ps2epsi, a script that is distributed as part of gs-common which
contains common files for different Ghostscript releases.  ps2epsi uses
a temporary file in the process of invoking ghostscript.  This file
was created in an insecure fashion, which could allow a local attacker
to overwrite files owned by a user who invokes ps2epsi.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3.0woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gs-common package.</p>
