<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a buffer overflow in xpcd-svga which can be
triggered by a long HOME environment variable.  This vulnerability
could be exploited by a local attacker to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.08-8woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xpcd package.</p>
