<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in kdebase:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0690">\
  CAN-2003-0690</a>:

  <p>KDM in KDE 3.1.3 and earlier does not verify whether the pam_setcred
  function call succeeds, which may allow attackers to gain root
  privileges by triggering error conditions within PAM modules, as
  demonstrated in certain configurations of the MIT pam_krb5 module.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0692">\
  CAN-2003-0692</a>:

  <p>KDM in KDE 3.1.3 and earlier uses a weak session cookie generation
  algorithm that does not provide 128 bits of entropy, which allows
  attackers to guess session cookies via brute force methods and gain
  access to the user session.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These vulnerabilities are described in the following security
advisory from KDE:</p>

<p><url http://www.kde.org/info/security/advisory-20030916-1.txt></p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 4:2.2.2-14.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your kdebase package.</p>
