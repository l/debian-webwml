<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>libpam-smb is a PAM authentication module which makes it possible to
authenticate users against a password database managed by Samba or a
Microsoft Windows server.  If a long password is supplied, this can
cause a buffer overflow which could be exploited to execute arbitrary
code with the privileges of the process which invokes PAM services.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.6-1.1woody1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does not contain a libpam-smb
package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your libpam-smb package.</p>
