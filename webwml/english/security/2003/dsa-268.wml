<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Core Security Technologies discovered a buffer overflow in the IMAP
code of Mutt, a text-oriented mail reader supporting IMAP, MIME, GPG,
PGP and threading.  This problem allows a remote malicious IMAP server
to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary
code via a specially crafted mail folder.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.28-2.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mutt package.</p>
