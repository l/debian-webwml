<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakob Lell discovered a bug in the 'noroff' script included in noweb
whereby a temporary file was created insecurely.  During a review,
several other instances of this problem were found and fixed.  Any of
these bugs could be exploited by a local user to overwrite arbitrary
files owned by the user invoking the script.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.9a-7.3.</p>

<p>For old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9a-5.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your noweb package.</p>
