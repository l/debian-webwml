<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Christian Jaeger discovered a buffer overflow in autorespond, an email
autoresponder used with qmail.  This vulnerability could potentially
be exploited by a remote attacker to gain the privileges of a user who
has configured qmail to forward messages to autorespond.  This
vulnerability is currently not believed to be exploitable due to
incidental limits on the length of the problematic input, but there
may be situations in which these limits do not apply.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your autorespond package.</p>
