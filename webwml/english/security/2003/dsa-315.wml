<define-tag description>buffer overflows, denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Bas Wijnen discovered that the gnocatan server is vulnerable to
several buffer overflows which could be exploited to execute arbitrary
code on the server system</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.1-5woody2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain a gnocatan package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gnocatan package.</p>
