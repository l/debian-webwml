<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in thttpd, a tiny HTTP
server.</p>

<p>The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1562">CAN-2002-1562</a>: Information leak

<p>  Marcus Breiing discovered that if thttpd it is used for virtual
  hosting, and an attacker supplies a specially crafted ``Host:''
  header with a pathname instead of a hostname, thttpd will reveal
  information about the host system.  Hence, an attacker can browse
  the entire disk.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0899">CAN-2003-0899</a>: Arbitrary code execution

<p>  Joel Soderberg and Christer Oberg discovered a remote overflow which
  allows an attacker to partially overwrite the EBP register and
  hence execute arbitrary code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.21b-11.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.23beta1-2.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your thttpd package immediately.</p>
