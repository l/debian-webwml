<define-tag description>insecure temporary files</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Paul Szabo discovered that znew, a script included in the gzip
package, creates its temporary files without taking precautions to
avoid a symlink attack (CAN-2003-0367).</p>

<p>The gzexe script has a similar vulnerability which was patched in an
earlier release but inadvertently reverted.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) both problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) CAN-2003-0367 has been fixed
in version 1.2.4-33.2.  This version is not vulnerable to
CVE-1999-1332 due to an earlier patch.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gzip package.</p>
