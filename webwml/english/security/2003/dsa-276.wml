<define-tag description>local privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The kernel module loader in Linux 2.2 and Linux 2.4 kernels has a flaw
in ptrace.  This hole allows local users to obtain root privileges by
using ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the
kernel.  Remote exploitation of this hole is not possible.</p>

<p>This advisory only covers kernel packages for the S/390 architecture.
Other architectures will be covered by separate advisories.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in the
following versions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>kernel-patch-2.4.17-s390: version 0.0.20020816-0.woody.1.1</li>
  <li>kernel-image-2.4.17-s390: version 2.4.17-2.woody.2.2</li>
</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem
for this architecture since s390 was first released with Debian
GNU/Linux 3.0 (woody).</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel-images packages immediately.</p>
