<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michal Zalewski discovered a buffer overflow, triggered by a char to
int conversion, in the address parsing code in sendmail, a widely used
powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent.  This problem
is potentially remotely exploitable.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 8.12.3-6.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
fixed in version 8.9.3-26.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 8.12.9-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sendmail packages.</p>
