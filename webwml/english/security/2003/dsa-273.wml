<define-tag description>Cryptographic weakness</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows
an attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any
principal in a realm.  Additional cryptographic weaknesses in the krb4
implementation permit the use of cut-and-paste attacks to fabricate
krb4 tickets for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are
used to key krb4 services.  These attacks can subvert a site's entire
Kerberos authentication infrastructure.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.1-8-2.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.0-2.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb4 packages immediately.</p>
