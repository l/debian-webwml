<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities were reported in sendmail.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0681">\
   CAN-2003-0681</a>:

   <p>A "potential buffer overflow in ruleset parsing" for Sendmail
   8.12.9, when using the nonstandard rulesets (1) recipient (2),
   final, or (3) mailer-specific envelope recipients, has unknown
   consequences.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0694">\
  CAN-2003-0694</a>:

  <p>The prescan function in Sendmail 8.12.9 allows remote attackers to
  execute arbitrary code via buffer overflow attacks, as demonstrated
  using the parseaddr function in parseaddr.c.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
sendmail version 8.12.3-6.6 and sendmail-wide version
8.12.3+3.5Wbeta-5.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
sendmail version 8.12.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your sendmail package.</p>
