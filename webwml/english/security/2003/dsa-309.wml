<define-tag moreinfo></p>
<p>"bazarr" discovered that eterm is vulnerable to a buffer overflow of
the ETERMPATH environment variable.  This bug can be exploited to gain
the privileges of the group "utmp" on a system where eterm is
installed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.2-0pre2002042903.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this bug.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your eterm package.</p>
