<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>eEye Digital Security discovered an integer overflow in the
xdrmem_getbytes() function which is also present in GNU libc.  This
function is part of the XDR (external data representation)
encoder/decoder derived from Sun's RPC implementation.  Depending upon
the application, this vulnerability can cause buffer overflows and
could possibly be exploited to execute arbitray code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.2.5-11.5.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.1.3-25.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.3.1-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libc6 packages.</p>
