<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>NOTE: due to a combination of administrative problems, this advisory
was erroneously released with the identifier "DSA-338-1".  DSA-338-1
correctly refers to an earlier advisory regarding proftpd.</p>

<p>x-face-el, a decoder for images included inline in X-Face email
headers, does not take appropriate security precautions when creating
temporary files.  This bug could potentially be exploited to overwrite
arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running Emacs and
x-face-el, potentially with contents supplied by the attacker.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6.19-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.6.23-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your x-face-el package.</p>
