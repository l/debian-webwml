<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Al Viro and Alan Cox discovered several maths overflow errors in
NetPBM, a set of graphics conversion tools.  These programs are not
installed setuid root but are often installed to prepare data for
processing.  These vulnerabilities may allow remote attackers to cause
a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 9.20-8.2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected
by this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 9.20-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your netpbm package.</p>
