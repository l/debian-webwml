<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>traceroute-nanog, an enhanced version of the common traceroute
program, contains an integer overflow bug which could be exploited to
execute arbitrary code.  traceroute-nanog is setuid root, but drops
root privileges immediately after obtaining raw ICMP and raw IP
sockets.  Thus, exploitation of this bug provides only access to these
sockets, and not root privileges.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.1.1-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
See Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/200875">bug #200875</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your traceroute-nanog package.</p>
