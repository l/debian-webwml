<define-tag description>insecure temporary directory</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>fdclone creates a temporary directory in /tmp as a workspace.
However, if this directory already exists, the existing directory is
used instead, regardless of its ownership or permissions.  This would
allow an attacker to gain access to fdclone's temporary files and
their contents, or replace them with other files under the attacker's
control.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.00a-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.04-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your fdclone package.</p>
