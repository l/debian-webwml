<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jens Steube reported a pair of buffer overflow vulnerabilities in
hztty, a program to translate Chinese character encodings in a
terminal session.  These vulnerabilities could be exploited by a local
attacker to gain root privileges on a system where hztty is installed.</p>

<p>Additionally, hztty had been incorrectly installed setuid root, when
it only requires the privileges of group utmp.  This has also been
corrected in this update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0-5.2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed in
version 2.0-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your hztty package.</p>
