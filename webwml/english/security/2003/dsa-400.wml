<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered a buffer overflow in the commandline and
environment variable handling of omega-rpg, a text-based rogue-style
game of dungeon exploration, which could lead a local attacker to gain
unauthorised access to the group games.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.90-pa9-7woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.90-pa9-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your omega-rpg package.</p>
