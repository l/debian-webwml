<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Earl Hood, author of mhonarc, a mail to HTML converter, discovered a
cross site scripting vulnerability in this package.  A specially
crafted HTML mail message can introduce foreign scripting content in
archives, by-passing MHonArc's HTML script filtering.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.5.2-1.3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.4.4-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mhonarc package.</p>
