<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered two problems in hypermail, a program to
create HTML archives of mailing lists.</p>

<p>An attacker could craft a long filename for an attachment that would
overflow two buffers when a certain option for interactive use was
given, opening the possibility to inject arbitrary code.  This code
would then be executed under the user id hypermail runs as, mostly as
a local user.  Automatic and silent use of hypermail does not seem to
be affected.</p>

<p>The CGI program mail, which is not installed by the Debian package,
does a reverse look-up of the user's IP number and copies the
resulting hostname into a fixed-size buffer.  A specially crafted DNS
reply could overflow this buffer, opening the program to an exploit.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.3-2.0.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0b25-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hypermail packages.</p>
