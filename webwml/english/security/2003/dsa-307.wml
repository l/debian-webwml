<p>gPS is a graphical application to watch system processes.  In release
1.1.0 of the gps package, several security vulnerabilities were fixed,
as detailed in the changelog:</p>

<ul>
<li> bug fix on rgpsp connection source acceptation policy
   (it was allowing any host to connect even when the
    /etc/rgpsp.conf file told otherwise).
   It is working now, but on any real ("production")
   network I suggest you use IP filtering to enforce
   the policy (like ipchains or iptables).</li>
<li> Several possibilities of buffer overflows have been
   fixed. Thanks to Stanislav Ievlev from ALT-Linux for
   pointing a lot of them.</li>
<li> fixed misformatting of command line parameters in
   rgpsp protocol (command lines with newlines would
   break the protocol).</li>
<li> fixed buffer overflow bug that caused rgpsp
   to SIGSEGV when stating processes with large
   command lines (&gt;128 chars) [Linux only].</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these problems affect Debian's gps package version 0.9.4-1 in
Debian woody.  Debian potato also contains a gps package (version
0.4.1-2), but it is not affected by these problems, as the relevant
functionality is not implemented in that version.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in
version 1.1.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gps package.</p>
