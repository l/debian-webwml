<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nicolas Boullis discovered two vulnerabilities in mah-jong, a
network-enabled game.</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0705">CAN-2003-0705</a> (buffer overflow)

<p>This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker to
   execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the
   mah-jong server.</p></li>

<li> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0706">CAN-2003-0706</a> (denial of service)

<p>This vulnerability could be exploited by a remote attacker to cause
  the mah-jong server to enter a tight loop and stop responding to
  commands.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.6-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mah-jong package.</p>
