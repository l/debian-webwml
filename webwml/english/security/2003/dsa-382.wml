<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A bug has been found in OpenSSH's buffer handling where a buffer could
be marked as grown when the actual reallocation failed.</p>

<p>This advisory is an addition to the earlier DSA-382-1 advisory: two more
buffer handling problems have been found in addition to the one
described in DSA-382-1. It is not known if these bugs are exploitable,
but as a precaution an upgrade is advised.</p>

<p>For the Debian stable distribution these bugs have been fixed in version
1:3.4p1-1.woody.2.</p>
