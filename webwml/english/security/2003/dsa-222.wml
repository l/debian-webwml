<p>iDEFENSE <a href="http://www.idefense.com/advisory/12.23.02.txt">\
discovered</a> an integer overflow in the pdftops filter from the
xpdf package that can be exploited to gain the privileges of the
target user.  This can lead to gaining unauthorized access to the 'lp'
user if the pdftops program is part of the print filter.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.00-3.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.90-8.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 2.01-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf package.</p>
