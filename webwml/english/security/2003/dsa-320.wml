<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ingo Saitz discovered a bug in mikmod whereby a long filename inside
an archive file can overflow a buffer when the archive is being read
by mikmod.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-4woody3.</p>

<p>For old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.6-2potato3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
3.1.6-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mikmod package.</p>
