<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>liece, an IRC client for Emacs, does not take appropriate security
precautions when creating temporary files.  This bug could potentially
be exploited to overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the
user running Emacs and liece, potentially with contents supplied
by the attacker.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0+0.20020217cvs-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0+0.20030527cvs-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your liece package.</p>
