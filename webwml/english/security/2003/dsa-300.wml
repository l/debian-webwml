<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Byrial Jensen discovered a couple of off-by-one buffer overflow in the
IMAP code of Mutt, a text-oriented mail reader supporting IMAP, MIME,
GPG, PGP and threading.  This code is imported in the Balsa package.
This problem could potentially allow a remote malicious IMAP server to
cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
via a specially crafted mail folder.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-2.2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your balsa package.</p>
