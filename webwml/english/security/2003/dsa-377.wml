<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>wu-ftpd, an FTP server, implements a feature whereby multiple files
can be fetched in the form of a dynamically constructed archive file,
such as a tar archive.  The names of the files to be included are
passed as command line arguments to tar, without protection against
them being interpreted as command-line options.  GNU tar supports
several command line options which can be abused, by means of this
vulnerability, to execute arbitrary programs with the privileges of
the wu-ftpd process.</p>

<p>Georgi Guninski pointed out that this vulnerability exists in Debian
woody.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.2-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your wu-ftpd package.</p>
