<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The KDE team discovered a vulnerability in the way KDE uses Ghostscript
software for processing of PostScript (PS) and PDF files.  An attacker
could provide a malicious PostScript or PDF file via mail or websites
that could lead to executing arbitrary commands under the privileges
of the user viewing the file or when the browser generates a directory
listing with thumbnails.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.2-13.woody.7 of kdelibs and associated packages.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it does not
contain KDE.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unofficial backport of KDE 3.1.1 to woody by Ralf Nolden on
download.kde.org, this problem has been fixed in version 3.1.1-0woody3
of kdelibs.  Using the normal backport line for apt-get you will get
the update:</p>

<p>  deb http://download.kde.org/stable/latest/Debian stable main</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs and associated packages.</p>
