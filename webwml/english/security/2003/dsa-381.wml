<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>MySQL, a popular relational database system, contains a buffer
overflow condition which could be exploited by a user who has
permission to execute "ALTER TABLE" commands on the tables in the
"mysql" database.  If successfully exploited, this vulnerability
could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the
privileges of the mysqld process (by default, user "mysql").  Since
the "mysql" database is used for MySQL's internal record keeping, by
default the mysql administrator "root" is the only user with
permission to alter its tables.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.23.49-8.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to Debian <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/210403">bug #210403</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your mysql package.</p>
