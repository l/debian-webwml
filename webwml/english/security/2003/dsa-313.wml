<define-tag description>buffer overflows, integer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered several vulnerabilities in ethereal, a
network traffic analyzer.  These include one-byte buffer overflows in
the AIM, GIOP Gryphon, OSPF, PPTP, Quake, Quake2, Quake3, Rsync, SMB,
SMPP, and TSP dissectors, and integer overflows in the Mount and PPP
dissectors.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody4.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not appear to contain these
vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in version
0.9.12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your ethereal package.</p>
