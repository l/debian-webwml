<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Knud Erik Højgaard discovered a vulnerability in moxftp (and xftp
respectively), an Athena X interface to FTP.  Insufficient bounds
checking could lead to execution of arbitrary code, provided by a
malicious FTP server.   Erik Tews fixed this.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2-18.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2-13.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed
in version 2.2-18.20.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xftp package.</p>
