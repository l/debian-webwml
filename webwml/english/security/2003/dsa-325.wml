<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>eldav, a WebDAV client for Emacs, creates temporary files without
taking appropriate security precautions.  This vulnerability could be
exploited by a local user to create or overwrite files with the
privileges of the user running emacs and eldav.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.0.20020411-1woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain an eldav
package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your eldav package.</p>
