<define-tag description>buffer overflows and other bugs</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The SuSE Security Team reviewed critical parts of openldap2, an
implementation of the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
version 2 and 3, and found several buffer overflows and other bugs
remote attackers could exploit to gain access on systems running
vulnerable LDAP servers.  In addition to these bugs, various local
exploitable bugs within the OpenLDAP2 libraries have been fixed.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been
fixed in version 2.0.23-6.3.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain OpenLDAP2
packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.27-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openldap2 packages.</p>
