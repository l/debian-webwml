<define-tag description>mail user privilege escalation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Heinz <email heinz@cronon-ag.de> posted to the Bugtraq mailing list an
exploit for qpopper based on a bug in the included vsnprintf implementation.
The sample exploit requires a valid user account and password, and overflows a
string in the pop_msg() function to give the user "mail" group privileges and a
shell on the system. Since the Qvsnprintf function is used elsewhere in
qpopper, additional exploits may be possible.</p>

<p>The qpopper package in Debian 2.2 (potato) does not include the vulnerable
snprintf implementation. For Debian 3.0 (woody) an updated package is available
in version 4.0.4-2.woody.3. Users running an unreleased version of Debian
should upgrade to 4.0.4-9 or newer. We recommend you upgrade your qpopper
package immediately.</p>
