<define-tag description>buffer overflows, integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered several problems in BitchX, a popular client
for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious server could craft special
reply strings, triggering the client to write beyond buffer boundaries
or allocate a negative amount of memory.  This could lead to a denial
of service if the client only crashes, but may also lead to executing
of arbitrary code under the user id of the chatting user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-0c19-1.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.0-0c16-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0-0c19-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your BitchX package.</p>
