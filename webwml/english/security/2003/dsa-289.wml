<define-tag description>incorrect memory resizing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sam Hocevar discovered a security problem in rinetd, an IP connection
redirection server.  When the connection list is full, rinetd resizes
the list in order to store the new incoming connection.  However, this
is done improperly, resulting in a denial of service and potentially
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.61-1.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.52-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.61-2</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rinetd package.</p>
