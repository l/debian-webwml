<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered multiple buffer overflows in atari800, an Atari
emulator.  In order to directly access graphics hardware, one of the
affected programs is setuid root.  A local attacker could exploit this
vulnerability to gain root privileges.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.2-1woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your atari800 package.</p>
