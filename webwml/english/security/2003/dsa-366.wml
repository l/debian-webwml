<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>eroaster, a frontend for burning CD-R media using cdrecord, does not
take appropriate security precautions when creating a temporary file
for use as a lockfile.  This bug could potentially be exploited to
overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
eroaster.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.0.0.3-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0-0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your eroaster package.</p>
