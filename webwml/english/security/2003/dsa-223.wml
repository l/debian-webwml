<p>A security issue has been discovered by Daniel de Rauglaudre, upstream
author of geneweb, a genealogical software with web interface.  It
runs as a daemon on port 2317 by default.  Paths are not properly
sanitized, so a carefully crafted URL lead geneweb to read and display
arbitrary files of the system it runs on.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 4.06-2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 4.09-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your geneweb package.</p>
