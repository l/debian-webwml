<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The logging code in nfs-utils contains an off-by-one buffer overrun
when adding a newline to the string being logged.  This vulnerability
may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of
service condition by sending certain RPC requests.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your nfs-utils package.</p>
