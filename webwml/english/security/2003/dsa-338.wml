<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>runlevel [runlevel@raregazz.org] reported that ProFTPD's PostgreSQL
authentication module is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.  This
vulnerability could be exploited by a remote, unauthenticated attacker
to execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially exposing the
passwords of other users, or to connect to ProFTPD as an arbitrary
user without supplying the correct password.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4+1.2.5rc1-5woody2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.8-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your proftpd package.</p>
