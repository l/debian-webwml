<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow exists in exim, which is the standard mail transport
agent in Debian.  By supplying a specially crafted HELO or EHLO
command, an attacker could cause a constant string to be written past
the end of a buffer allocated on the heap.  This vulnerability is not
believed at this time to be exploitable to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
exim version 3.35-1woody2 and exim-tls version 3.35-3woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
exim version 3.36-8.  The unstable distribution does not contain an
exim-tls package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your exim or exim-tls package.</p>
