<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp discovered two buffer overflows in xtokkaetama, a puzzle
game, when processing the -display command line option and the
XTOKKAETAMADIR environment variable.  These vulnerabilities could be
exploited by a local attacker to gain gid 'games'.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed
in version 1.0b-6woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem is fixed in version
1.0b-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your xtokkaetama package.</p>
