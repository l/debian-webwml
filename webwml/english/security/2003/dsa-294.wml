<p>Brian Campbell discovered two security-related problems in
gkrellm-newsticker, a plugin for the gkrellm system monitor program,
which provides a news ticker from RDF feeds.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<dl>
<dt><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0205">CAN-2003-0205</a></dt>
<dd>
  It can launch a web browser of the user's choice when the ticker
  title is clicked by using the URI given by the feed.  However,
  special shell characters are not properly escaped enabling a
  malicious feed to execute arbitrary shell commands on the clients
  machine.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0206">CAN-2003-0206</a></dt>
<dd>
  It crashes the entire gkrellm system on feeds where link or title
  elements are not entirely on a single line.  A malicious server
  could therefore craft a denial of service.</dd>

</dl>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3-3.1</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't
contain gkrellm-newsticker packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems is not yet fixed.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gkrellm-newsticker package.</p>
