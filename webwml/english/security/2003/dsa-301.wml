<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The gtop daemon, used for monitoring remote machines, contains a
buffer overflow which could be used by an attacker to execute
arbitrary code with the privileges of the daemon process.  If started
as root, the daemon process drops root privileges, assuming uid and
gid 99 by default.</p>

<p>This bug was previously fixed in DSA-098, but one of the patches was
not carried over to later versions of libgtop.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.13-3.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato), this problem was fixed in
DSA-098.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.13-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your libgtop package.</p>
