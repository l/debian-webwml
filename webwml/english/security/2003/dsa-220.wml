<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cross site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in
squirrelmail, a feature-rich webmail package written in PHP4.
Squirrelmail doesn't sanitize user provided variables in all places,
leaving it vulnerable to a cross site scripting attack.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.6-1.3.  The old stable distribution (potato) is
not affected since it doesn't contain a squirrelmail package.</p>

<p>An updated package for the unstable distribution (sid) is
expected soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
