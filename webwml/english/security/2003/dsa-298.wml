<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered several problems in EPIC4, a popular client
for Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  A malicious server could craft special
reply strings, triggering the client to write beyond buffer
boundaries.  This could lead to a denial of service if the client only
crashes, but may also lead to executing of arbitrary code under the
user id of the chatting user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.2.20020219-2.1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been
fixed in version pre2.508-2.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.11.20030409-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your EPIC4 package.</p>
