<p>A security vulnerability has been confirmed to exist in Apache Tomcat
4.0.x releases, which allows to use a specially crafted URL to return
the unprocessed source of a JSP page, or, under special circumstances,
a static resource which would otherwise have been protected by a
security constraint, without the need for being properly
authenticated.  This is based on a variant of the exploit that was
identified as <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-1148">CAN-2002-1148</a>.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 4.0.3-3woody2.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain tomcat packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem does not exist in the
current version 4.1.16-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat packages.</p>
