<define-tag description>buffer overflow, incorrect permissions</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The nethack and slashem packages are vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploited via a
long '-s' command line option.  This vulnerability could be used by an
attacker to gain gid 'games' on a system where nethack is installed.</p>

<p>Additionally, some setgid binaries in the nethack package have
incorrect permissions, which could allow a user who gains gid 'games'
to replace these binaries, potentially causing other users to execute
malicious code when they run nethack.</p>

<p>Note that slashem does not contain the file permission problem
CAN-2003-0359.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.4.0-3.0woody3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.0-7potato1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in
version 3.4.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your nethack package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.0.6E4F8-4.0woody3.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.0.5E7-3potato1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in
version 0.0.6E4F8-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your slashem package.</p>
