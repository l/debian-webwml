<define-tag description>buffer overflows, file and directory exposure</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jens Steube reported two vulnerabilities in webfs, a lightweight HTTP
server for static content.</p>

<p> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0832">CAN-2003-0832</a> - When virtual hosting is enabled, a remote client
 could specify ".." as the hostname in a request, allowing retrieval
 of directory listings or files above the document root.</p>

<p> <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0833">CAN-2003-0833</a> - A long pathname could overflow a buffer allocated on
 the stack, allowing execution of arbitrary code.  In order to exploit
 this vulnerability, it would be necessary to be able to create
 directories on the server in a location which could be accessed by
 the web server.  In conjunction with <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2003-0832">CAN-2003-0832</a>, this could be a
 world-writable directory such as /var/tmp.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed
in version 1.17.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.20.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your webfs package.</p>
