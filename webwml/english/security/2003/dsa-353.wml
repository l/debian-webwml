<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>sup, a package used to maintain collections of files in identical
versions across machines, fails to take appropriate security
precautions when creating temporary files.  A local attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to overwrite arbitrary files with the
privileges of the user running sup.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8-8woody1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your sup package.</p>
