<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Upstream developers of lxr, a general hypertext cross-referencing
tool, have been alerted of a vulnerability that allows a remote
attacker to read arbitrary files on the host system as user www-data.
This could disclose local files that were not meant to be shared with
the public.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.3-3.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it does not
contain an lxr package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.3-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lxr package.</p>
