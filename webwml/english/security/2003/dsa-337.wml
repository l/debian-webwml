<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Viliam Holub discovered a bug in gtksee whereby, when loading PNG
images of certain color depths, gtksee would overflow a heap-allocated
buffer.  This vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker using a
carefully constructed PNG image to execute arbitrary code when the
victim loads the file in gtksee.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.0-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.
Refer to <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/76346">Debian bug #76346</a>.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your gtksee package.</p>
