<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several of the packet dissectors in ethereal contain string handling
bugs which could be exploited using a maliciously crafted packet to
cause ethereal to consume excessive amounts of memory, crash, or
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>These vulnerabilities were announced in the following Ethereal security
advisory:</p>

<p><url "http://www.ethereal.com/appnotes/enpa-sa-00010.html"></p>

<p>Ethereal 0.9.4 in Debian 3.0 (woody) is affected by most of the
problems described in the advisory, including:</p>

<ul>
<li> The DCERPC dissector could try to allocate too much memory
      while trying to decode an NDR string.
<li> Bad IPv4 or IPv6 prefix lengths could cause an overflow in the
      OSI dissector.
<li> The tvb_get_nstringz0() routine incorrectly handled a
      zero-length buffer size.
<li> The BGP, WTP, DNS, 802.11, ISAKMP, WSP, CLNP, and ISIS
      dissectors handled strings improperly.
</ul>

<p>The following problems do <strong>not</strong> affect this version:</p>

<ul>
<li> The SPNEGO dissector could segfault while parsing an invalid
      ASN.1 value.
<li> The RMI dissector handled strings improperly
</ul>

<p>as these modules are not present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.4-1woody5.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) these problems will be fixed in a
future advisory.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems are fixed in
version 0.9.13-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your ethereal package.</p>
