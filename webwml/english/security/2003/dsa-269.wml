<define-tag description>Cryptographic weakness</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cryptographic weakness in version 4 of the Kerberos protocol allows
an attacker to use a chosen-plaintext attack to impersonate any
principal in a realm.  Additional cryptographic weaknesses in the krb4
implementation permit the use of cut-and-paste attacks to fabricate
krb4 tickets for unauthorized client principals if triple-DES keys are
used to key krb4 services.  These attacks can subvert a site's entire
Kerberos authentication infrastructure.</p>

<p>This version of the heimdal package changes the default behavior and
disallows cross-realm authentication for Kerberos version 4.  Because
of the fundamental nature of the problem, cross-realm authentication
in Kerberos version 4 cannot be made secure and sites should avoid its
use.  A new option (--kerberos4-cross-realm) is provided to the kdc 
command to re-enable version 4 cross-realm authentication for those
sites that must use this functionality but desire the other security
fixes.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.4e-7.woody.6</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected by this problem,
since it isn't compiled against kerberos 4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.5.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages immediately.</p>
