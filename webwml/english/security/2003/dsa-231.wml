<define-tag description>stack overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Internet Software Consortium discovered several vulnerabilities
during an audit of the ISC DHCP Daemon.  The vulnerabilities exist in
error handling routines within the minires library and may be
exploitable as stack overflows.  This could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code under the user id the dhcpd runs under, usually
root.  Other DHCP servers than dhcp3 doesn't seem to be affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been
fixed in version 3.0+3.0.1rc9-2.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain dhcp3 packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0+3.0.1rc11-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dhcp3-server package.</p>
