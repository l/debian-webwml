<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>radiusd-cistron contains a bug allowing a buffer overflow when a long
NAS-Port attribute is received.  This could allow a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the RADIUS daemon
(usually root).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato), this problem will be fixed
in a later advisory.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your radiusd-cistron package.</p>
