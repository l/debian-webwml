<p>Rémi Perrot fixed several security related bugs in the bonsai, the
Mozilla CVS query tool by web interface.  Vulnerabilities include
arbitrary code execution, cross-site scripting and access to
configuration parameters.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>
<li> CAN-2003-0152 - Remote execution of arbitrary commands as www-data</li>

<li> CAN-2003-0153 - Absolute path disclosure</li>

<li> CAN-2003-0154 - Cross site scripting attacks </li>

<li> CAN-2003-0155 - Unauthenticated access to parameters page</li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+cvs20020224-1woody1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) is not affected since it doesn't
contain bonsai.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3+cvs20030317-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bonsai package.</p>
