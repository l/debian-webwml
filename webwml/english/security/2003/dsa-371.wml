<define-tag description>cross-site scripting</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the start_form()
function in CGI.pm.  This function outputs user-controlled data into
the action attribute of a form element without sanitizing it, allowing
a remote user to execute arbitrary web script within the context of
the generated page.  Any program which uses this function in the
CGI.pm module may be affected.</p>

<p>For the current stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed
in version 5.6.1-8.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.0-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you update your perl package.</p>
