<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Timo Sirainen discovered a vulnerability in pptpd, a Point to Point
Tunneling Server, which implements PPTP-over-IPSEC and is commonly
used to create Virtual Private Networks (VPN).  By specifying a small
packet length an attacker is able to overflow a buffer and execute
code under the user id that runs pptpd, probably root.  An exploit for
this problem is already circulating.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-1.4.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (potato) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.0.0-4.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.4-0.b3.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pptpd package immediately.</p>
