<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in lpr, a BSD lpr/lpd line
printer spooling system.  This problem can be exploited by a local
user to gain root privileges, even if the printer system is set up
properly.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.72-2.1.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain lpr-ppd packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.72-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lpr-ppd package immediately.</p>
