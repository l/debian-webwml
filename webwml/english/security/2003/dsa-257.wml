<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mark Dowd of ISS X-Force found a bug in the header parsing routines
of sendmail: it could overflow a buffer overflow when encountering
addresses with very long comments. Since sendmail also parses headers
when forwarding emails this vulnerability can hit mail-servers which do
not deliver the email as well.</p>

<p>This has been fixed in upstream release 8.12.8, version 8.12.3-5 of
the package for Debian GNU/Linux 3.0/woody and version 8.9.3-25 of the
package for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2/potato.</p>
