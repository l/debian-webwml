<define-tag description>missing input sanitizing</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The developers of courier, an integrated user side mail server,
discovered a problem in the PostgreSQL auth module.  Not all
potentially malicious characters were sanitized before the username
was passed to the PostgreSQL engine.  An attacker could inject
arbitrary SQL commands and queries exploiting this vulnerability.  The
MySQL auth module is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.37.3-3.3.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (potato) does not contain courier packages.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.40.2-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your courier-authpostgresql package.</p>
