<H1>Cross References of Debian Security Advisories</H1>

<p>The <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/">Debian Security
Tracker</a> is the canonical place where CVE names, Debian packages,
DSA's and Debian bug numbers are cross referenced. The tracker dates
back to Debian Woody.</p>

<p>For older DSA's and issues, this page is available
which shows cross references of Debian Security Advisories
to other security information sources. This data is provided in the
hopes that might be useful to track down information relevant
to security issues and fixes in the Debian distribution.</p>

<P><em>Note:</em> The data below is sorted in reverse chronological order.
