This vulnerability may allow remote users to execute arbitrary commands
with the privileges of the user that manages the news server.

<p>Quoting from CA-1997-08:<br>
Remote, unauthorized users can execute arbitrary commands on the system
with the same privileges as the innd (INN daemon) process.  Attacks may
reach news servers located behind Internet firewalls.

<p>Versions of INN prior to 1.5.1 are vulnerable.

<p>The Debian entry from CA-1997-08:<br>
The current version of INN shipped with Debian is 1.4unoff4.
However the "unstable" (or development) tree contains inn-1.5.1.
