<define-tag moreinfo>
Users can gain root access with suidperl version 5.003.

<p>If called with crafted parameters, a buffer overflow condition in
suidperl could allow a user to execute arbitrary commands as root.

<p>Unpatched versions of suidperl (sperl) 4.n and 5.n prior to 5.004, are
vulnerable.
