Local users may gain root privileges by exploiting a buffer overflow
in the dynamic linker (ld.so).

<p>The vulnerability may also allow remote users to obtain root access.

<p>This paragraph was extracted from CIAC h-86 (see References):<br>
On Linux, programs linked against shared libraries execute some code
contained in /lib/ld.so (for a.out binaries) or /lib/ld-linux.so (for
ELF binaries), which loads the shared libraries and binds all symbols.
If an error occurs during this stage, an error message is printed and
the program terminates. The printf replacement used at this stage is
not protected from buffer overruns.
