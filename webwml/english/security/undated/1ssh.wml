<define-tag description>unauthorized port forwarding</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
ssh allowed non-privileged users to forward privileged ports.

<p>Fixes: ssh 1.2.21-1 or later

<p>Insufficient permission checking may allow an SSH client user to
access remote accounts belonging to the ssh-agent user.

<p>SSH versions 1.2.17 through 1.2.21 are vulnerable.  SSH versions
prior to 1.2.17 are vulnerable to a different, though similar,
attack.
