<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update doesn't fix a vulnerability in GCC itself, but instead
provides support for building retpoline-enabled Linux kernel updates.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.0-18+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gcc-6 packages.</p>
