<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12867">CVE-2017-12867</a>

     <p>Attackers with access to a secret token could extend its validity
     period by manipulating the prepended time offset.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12869">CVE-2017-12869</a>

    <p>When using the multiauth module, attackers can bypass authentication
    context restrictions and use any authentication source defined in
    the config.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12873">CVE-2017-12873</a>

    <p>Defensive measures have been taken to prevent the administrator
    from misconfiguring persistent NameIDs to avoid identifier clash.

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-12874">CVE-2017-12874</a>

    <p>The InfoCard module could accept incorrectly signed XML messages
    in rare occasions.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18121">CVE-2017-18121</a>

    <p>The consentAdmin module was vulnerable to a Cross-Site Scripting
    attack, allowing an attacker to craft links that could execute

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18122">CVE-2017-18122</a>

    <p>The (deprecated) SAML 1.1 implementation would regard as valid any
    unsigned SAML response containing more than one signed assertion,
    provided that the signature of at least one of the assertions was
    valid, allowing an attacker that could obtain a valid signed
    assertion from an IdP to impersonate users from that IdP.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6519">CVE-2018-6519</a>

    <p>Regular expression denial of service when parsing extraordinarily

<li>SSPSA-201802-01 (no CVE yet)

    <p>Critical signature validation vulnerability.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
