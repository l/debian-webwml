<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in Libtasn1, a library to manage
ASN.1 structures, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of
service against an application using the Libtasn1 library.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.10-1.1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libtasn1-6 please refer to its
security tracker page at:
