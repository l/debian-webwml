<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing
daemon. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5378">CVE-2018-5378</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not
    properly bounds check data sent with a NOTIFY to a peer, if an
    attribute length is invalid. A configured BGP peer can take
    advantage of this bug to read memory from the bgpd process or cause
    a denial of service (daemon crash).</p>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5379">CVE-2018-5379</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can double-free
    memory when processing certain forms of UPDATE message, containing
    cluster-list and/or unknown attributes, resulting in a denial of
    service (bgpd daemon crash).</p>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5380">CVE-2018-5380</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, does not
    properly handle internal BGP code-to-string conversion tables.</p>

    <p>https://www.quagga.net/security/Quagga-2018-1550.txt</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5381">CVE-2018-5381</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Quagga BGP daemon, bgpd, can enter an
    infinite loop if sent an invalid OPEN message by a configured peer.
    A configured peer can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial
    of service (bgpd daemon not responding to any other events; BGP
    sessions will drop and not be reestablished; unresponsive CLI
    interface).</p>
