<p>Gabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop
environment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If
the environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a "%s" and the
victim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious
party could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened.
This manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network
traffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-7.4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.</p>
