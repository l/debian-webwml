<p>A heap corruption vulnerability was discovered in net-snmp, a suite of
Simple Network Management Protocol applications, triggered when parsing
the PDU prior to the authentication process. A remote, unauthenticated
attacker can take advantage of this flaw to crash the snmpd process
(causing a denial of service) or, potentially, execute arbitrary code
with the privileges of the user running snmpd.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.7.2.1+dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
before the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your net-snmp packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of net-snmp please refer to its
security tracker page at:
