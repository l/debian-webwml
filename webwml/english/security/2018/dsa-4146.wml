<p>Charles Duffy discovered that the Commandline class in the utilities for
the Plexus framework performs insufficient quoting of double-encoded
strings, which could result in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.5.15-4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.5.15-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your plexus-utils packages.</p>
