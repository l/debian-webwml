<p>Charles Duffy discovered that the Commandline class in the utilities for
the Plexus framework performs insufficient quoting of double-encoded
strings, which could result in the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.0.15-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed prior
to the initial release.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your plexus-utils2 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of plexus-utils2 please refer to
