<p>The Shopify Application Security Team reported that ruby-loofah, a
general library for manipulating and transforming HTML/XML documents and
fragments, allows non-whitelisted attributes to be present in sanitized
output when input with specially-crafted HTML fragments. This might
allow to mount a code injection attack into a browser consuming
sanitized output.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-loofah packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of ruby-loofah please refer to its
security tracker page at:
