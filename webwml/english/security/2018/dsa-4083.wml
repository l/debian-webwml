<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stephan Zeisberg discovered that poco, a collection of open source C++
class libraries, did not correctly validate file paths in ZIP
archives. An attacker could leverage this flaw to create or overwrite
arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.6p1-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.6+dfsg1-5+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your poco packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of poco please refer to
