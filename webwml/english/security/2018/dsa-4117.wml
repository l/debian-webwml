<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update doesn't fix a vulnerability in GCC itself, but instead
provides support for building retpoline-enabled Linux kernel updates.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.9.2-10+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gcc-4.9 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of gcc-4.9 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
