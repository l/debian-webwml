<p>Michal Kedzior found two vulnerabilities in LDAP Account Manager, a web
front-end for LDAP directories.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8763">CVE-2018-8763</a>

    <p>The found Reflected Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability might
    allow an attacker to execute JavaScript code in the browser of the
    victim or to redirect her to a malicious website if the victim clicks
    on a specially crafted link.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8764">CVE-2018-8764</a>

    <p>The application leaks the CSRF token in the URL, which can be use by
    an attacker to perform a Cross-Site Request Forgery attack, in which
    a victim logged in LDAP Account Manager might performed unwanted
    actions in the front-end by clicking on a link crafted by the
    attacker.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.7.1-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.5-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ldap-account-manager packages.</p>
