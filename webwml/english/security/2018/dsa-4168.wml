<p>Florian Grunow und Birk Kauer of ERNW discovered a path traversal
vulnerability in SquirrelMail, a webmail application, allowing an
authenticated remote attacker to retrieve or delete arbitrary files
via mail attachment.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:1.4.23~svn20120406-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail packages.</p>
