<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform SQL injections and
various Cross-Side Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF) attacks, as well as bypass some access restrictions.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u16.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7.5+dfsg-2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.</p>
