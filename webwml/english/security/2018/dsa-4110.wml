<p>Meh Chang discovered a buffer overflow flaw in a utility function used
in the SMTP listener of Exim, a mail transport agent. A remote attacker
can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service, or
potentially the execution of arbitrary code via a specially crafted
message.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.84.2-2+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.89-2+deb9u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your exim4 packages.</p>
