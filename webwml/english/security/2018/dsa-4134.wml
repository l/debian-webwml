<p>Bjorn Bosselmann discovered that the umount bash completion from
util-linux does not properly handle embedded shell commands in a
mountpoint name. An attacker with rights to mount filesystems can take
advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation if a user (in particular
root) is tricked into using the umount completion while a specially
crafted mount is present.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.29.2-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your util-linux packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of util-linux please refer to its
security tracker page at:
