<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-9016">CVE-2015-9016</a>

    <p>Ming Lei reported a race condition in the multiqueue block layer
    (blk-mq).  On a system with a driver using blk-mq (mtip32xx,
    null_blk, or virtio_blk), a local user might be able to use this
    for denial of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-0861">CVE-2017-0861</a>

    <p>Robb Glasser reported a potential use-after-free in the ALSA (sound)
    PCM core.  We believe this was not possible in practice.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>

    <p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.</p>

    <p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the <q>retpoline</q> compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753">CVE-2017-5753</a>

    <p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.</p>

    <p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.</p>

    <p>More use sites will be added over time.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13166">CVE-2017-13166</a>

    <p>A bug in the 32-bit compatibility layer of the v4l2 ioctl handling
    code has been found. Memory protections ensuring user-provided
    buffers always point to userland memory were disabled, allowing
    destination addresses to be in kernel space. On a 64-bit kernel a
    local user with access to a suitable video device can exploit this
    to overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-13220">CVE-2017-13220</a>

    <p>Al Viro reported that the Bluetooth HIDP implementation could
    dereference a pointer before performing the necessary type check.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16526">CVE-2017-16526</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the UWB subsystem may dereference
    an invalid pointer in an error case.  A local user might be able
    to use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16911">CVE-2017-16911</a>

    <p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP vhci_hcd driver exposed
    kernel heap addresses to local users.  This information could aid the
    exploitation of other vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16912">CVE-2017-16912</a>

    <p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to an out-of-bounds read.  A remote user able to connect to the
    USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16913">CVE-2017-16913</a>

    <p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    perform a range check on a received packet header field, leading
    to excessive memory allocation.  A remote user able to connect to
    the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16914">CVE-2017-16914</a>

    <p>Secunia Research reported that the USB/IP stub driver failed to
    check for an invalid combination of fields in a received packet,
    leading to a null pointer dereference.  A remote user able to
    connect to the USB/IP server could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18017">CVE-2017-18017</a>

    <p>Denys Fedoryshchenko reported that the netfilter xt_TCPMSS module
    failed to validate TCP header lengths, potentially leading to a
    use-after-free.  If this module is loaded, it could be used by a
    remote attacker for denial of service or possibly for code
    execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18203">CVE-2017-18203</a>

    <p>Hou Tao reported that there was a race condition in creation and
    deletion of device-mapper (DM) devices.  A local user could
    potentially use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18216">CVE-2017-18216</a>

    <p>Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18232">CVE-2017-18232</a>

    <p>Jason Yan reported a race condition in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem, between probing and destroying a port.  This
    could lead to a deadlock.  A physically present attacker could
    use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18241">CVE-2017-18241</a>

    <p>Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the <q>noflush_merge</q> mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1066">CVE-2018-1066</a>

    <p>Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1068">CVE-2018-1068</a>

    <p>The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1092">CVE-2018-1092</a>

    <p>Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5332">CVE-2018-5332</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not
    sufficiently validate RDMA requests, leading to an out-of-bounds
    write.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded
    could use this for denial of service or possibly for privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5333">CVE-2018-5333</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam reported that the RDS protocol did not properly
    handle an error case, leading to a null pointer dereference.  A
    local attacker on a system with the rds module loaded could
    possibly use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5750">CVE-2018-5750</a>

    <p>Wang Qize reported that the ACPI sbshc driver logged a kernel heap
    address.  This information could aid the exploitation of other
    vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5803">CVE-2018-5803</a>

    <p>Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6927">CVE-2018-6927</a>

    <p>The syzkaller tool found that the RDS protocol was lacking a null
    pointer check.  A local attacker on a system with the rds module
    loaded could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7566">CVE-2018-7566</a>

    <p>Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7740">CVE-2018-7740</a>

    <p>Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7757">CVE-2018-7757</a>

    <p>Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7995">CVE-2018-7995</a>

    <p>Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8781">CVE-2018-8781</a>

    <p>Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8822">CVE-2018-8822</a>

    <p>Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000004">CVE-2018-1000004</a>

    <p>Luo Quan reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound) sequencer
    core, between multiple ioctl operations.  This could lead to a
    deadlock or use-after-free.  A local user with access to a
