<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000120">CVE-2018-1000120</a>

    <p>Duy Phan Thanh discovered that curl could be fooled into writing a
    zero byte out of bounds when curl is told to work on an FTP URL with
    the setting to only issue a single CWD command, if the directory part
    of the URL contains a &ldquo;&#37;00&rdquo; sequence.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000121">CVE-2018-1000121</a>

    <p>Dario Weisser discovered that curl might dereference a near-NULL
    address when getting an LDAP URL due to the ldap_get_attribute_ber()
    function returning LDAP_SUCCESS and a NULL pointer. A malicious server
    might cause libcurl-using applications that allow LDAP URLs, or that
    allow redirects to LDAP URLs to crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000122">CVE-2018-1000122</a>

    <p>OSS-fuzz, assisted by Max Dymond, discovered that curl could be
    tricked into copying data beyond the end of its heap based buffer
    when asked to transfer an RTSP URL.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.38.0-4+deb8u10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.52.1-5+deb9u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
