    <p>Denial Berrange discovered that the QEMU guest agent performed
    insufficient validationof incoming data, which allows a privileged
    user in the guest to exhaust resources on the virtualisation host,
    resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

    <p>Daniel Berrange and Peter Krempa that the QEMU monitor was suspectible
    to denial of service by memory exhaustion. This was already fixed in
    Debian stretch and only affects Debian jessie.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6764">CVE-2018-6764</a>

    <p>Pedro Sampaio discovered that LXC containes detected the hostname
