<p>Harry Sintonen discovered that wget, a network utility to retrieve files
from the web, does not properly handle '\r\n' from continuation lines
while parsing the Set-Cookie HTTP header. A malicious web server could
use this flaw to inject arbitrary cookies to the cookie jar file, adding
new or replacing existing cookie values.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.16-1+deb8u5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18-5+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wget packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of wget please refer to its security
tracker page at:
