<p>It was discovered that insufficient input sanitising in libevt, a library
to access the Windows Event Log (EVT) format, could result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed EVT file is
processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 20170120-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libevt packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libevt please refer to
