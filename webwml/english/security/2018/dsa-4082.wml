<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5754">CVE-2017-5754</a>

    <p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel
    processors, enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged
    process to read memory from arbitrary addresses, including from
    the kernel and all other processes running on the system.</p>

    <p>This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in
    the Linux kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set
    named Kernel Page Table Isolation, enforcing a near complete
    separation of the kernel and userspace address maps and preventing
    the attack. This solution might have a performance impact, and can
    be disabled at boot time by passing <code>pti=off</code> to the kernel
    command line.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-8824">CVE-2017-8824</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam discovered that the DCCP implementation did not
    correctly manage resources when a socket is disconnected and
    reconnected, potentially leading to a use-after-free.  A local
    user could use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.  On systems that
    do not already have the dccp module loaded, this can be mitigated
    by disabling it:
    <code>echo >> /etc/modprobe.d/disable-dccp.conf install dccp false</code></p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-15868">CVE-2017-15868</a>

    <p>Al Viro found that the Bluebooth Network Encapsulation Protocol
    (BNEP) implementation did not validate the type of the second
    socket passed to the BNEPCONNADD ioctl(), which could lead to
    memory corruption.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability
    can use this for denial of service (crash or data corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16538">CVE-2017-16538</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that the dvb-usb-lmedm04 media driver
    did not correctly handle some error conditions during
    initialisation.  A physically present user with a specially
    designed USB device can use this to cause a denial of service
    (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-16939">CVE-2017-16939</a>

    <p>Mohamed Ghannam reported (through Beyond Security's SecuriTeam
    Secure Disclosure program) that the IPsec (xfrm) implementation
    did not correctly handle some failure cases when dumping policy
    information through netlink.  A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability can use this for denial of service (crash or data
    corruption) or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17448">CVE-2017-17448</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netfilter subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace, not
    just the root namespace, to enable and disable connection tracking
    helpers.  This could lead to denial of service, violation of
    network security policy, or have other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17449">CVE-2017-17449</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the netlink subsystem allowed
    users with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace
    to monitor netlink traffic in all net namespaces, not just
    those owned by that user namespace.  This could lead to
    exposure of sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17450">CVE-2017-17450</a>

    <p>Kevin Cernekee discovered that the xt_osf module allowed users
    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in any user namespace to modify
    the global OS fingerprint list.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17558">CVE-2017-17558</a>

    <p>Andrey Konovalov reported that that USB core did not correctly
    handle some error conditions during initialisation.  A physically
    present user with a specially designed USB device can use this to
    cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17741">CVE-2017-17741</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17805">CVE-2017-17805</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov reported that the KVM implementation for x86 would
    over-read data from memory when emulating an MMIO write if the
    kvm_mmio tracepoint was enabled.  A guest virtual machine might be
    able to use this to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17806">CVE-2017-17806</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the HMAC implementation could be used with
    an underlying hash algorithm that requires a key, which was not
    intended.  A local user could use this to cause a denial of
    service (crash or memory corruption), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17807">CVE-2017-17807</a>

    <p>Eric Biggers discovered that the KEYS subsystem lacked a check for
    write permission when adding keys to a process's default keyring.
    A local user could use this to cause a denial of service or to
    obtain sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000407">CVE-2017-1000407</a>

    <p>Andrew Honig reported that the KVM implementation for Intel
    processors allowed direct access to host I/O port 0x80, which
    is not generally safe.  On some systems this allows a guest
    VM to cause a denial of service (crash) of the host.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000410">CVE-2017-1000410</a>

    <p>Ben Seri reported that the Bluetooth subsystem did not correctly
    handle short EFS information elements in L2CAP messages.  An
    attacker able to communicate over Bluetooth could use this to
    obtain sensitive information from the kernel.</p></li>
