<p>Philip Huppert discovered the Shibboleth service provider is vulnerable
to impersonation attacks and information disclosure due to mishandling
of DTDs in the XMLTooling XML parsing library. For additional details
please refer to the upstream advisory at
<a href="https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20180112.txt">\
https://shibboleth.net/community/advisories/secadv_20180112.txt</a></p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.5.3-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (stretch) is not affected.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmltooling packages.</p>
