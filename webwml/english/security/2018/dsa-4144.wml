<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in denial of
service, sandbox bypass, execution of arbitrary code, incorrect
LDAP/GSS authentication, insecure use of cryptography or bypass of
deserialisation restrictions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been
fixed in version 8u162-b12-1~deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-8 packages.</p>
