<p>It was discovered that mpv, a media player, was vulnerable to remote code
execution attacks. An attacker could craft a malicious web page that,
when used as an argument in mpv, could execute arbitrary code in the host
of the mpv user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.23.0-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mpv packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of mpv please refer to
its security tracker page at:
