<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update provides mitigations for the Spectre v4 variant in x86-based
micro processors. On Intel CPUs this requires updated microcode which
is currently not released publicly (but your hardware vendor may have
issued an update). For servers with AMD CPUs no microcode update is
needed, please refer to <a href="https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-263.html">\
https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-263.html</a> for further information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8.3+xsa262+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
