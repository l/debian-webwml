<p>Marcin Noga discovered multiple vulnerabilities in readxl, a GNU R
package to read Excel files (via the integrated libxls library), which
could result in the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
spreadsheet is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.1.1-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your r-cran-readxl packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of r-cran-readxl please refer to
its security tracker page at:
