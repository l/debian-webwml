<p>Calum Hutton and the Mailman team discovered a cross site scripting and
information leak vulnerability in the user options page. A remote
attacker could use a crafted URL to steal cookie information or to
fish for whether a user is subscribed to a list with a private roster.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.1.18-2+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.23-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.</p>
