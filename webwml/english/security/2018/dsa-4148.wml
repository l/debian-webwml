<p>Alfred Farrugia and Sandro Gauci discovered an off-by-one heap overflow
in the Kamailio SIP server which could result in denial of service and
potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.2.0-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
