<p>Fabian Vogt discovered that incorrect permission handling in the PAM
module of the KDE Wallet could allow an unprivileged local user to gain
ownership of arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.4-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kwallet-pam packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of kwallet-pam please refer to
its security tracker page at:
