<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The cPanel Security Team discovered that awstats, a log file analyzer,
was vulnerable to path traversal attacks. A remote unauthenticated
attacker could leverage that to perform arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 7.2+dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.6+dfsg-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your awstats packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of awstats please refer to
its security tracker page at:
