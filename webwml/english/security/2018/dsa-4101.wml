<p>It was discovered that wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, contained
several vulnerabilities in the dissectors/file parsers for IxVeriWave,
WCP, JSON, XML, NTP, XMPP and GDB, which could result in denial of
service or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.12.1+g01b65bf-4+deb8u13.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
