<p>It was discovered that Smarty, a PHP template engine, was vulnerable to
code-injection attacks. An attacker was able to craft a filename in
comments that could lead to arbitrary code execution on the host running
Smarty.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.21-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.31+20161214.1.c7d42e4+selfpack1-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smarty3 packages.</p>
