<p>It has been discovered that Tor, a connection-based low-latency
anonymous communication system, contains a protocol-list handling bug
that could be used to remotely crash directory authorities with a
null-pointer exception (TROVE-2018-001).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.9.15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of tor please refer to its security
tracker page at:
