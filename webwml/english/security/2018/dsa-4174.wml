<p>The Citrix Security Response Team discovered that corosync, a cluster
engine implementation, allowed an unauthenticated user to cause a
denial-of-service by application crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-3+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your corosync packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of corosync please refer to
