<p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel processors,
enabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from
arbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running
on the system.</p>

<p>This specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the Linux
kernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named Kernel Page Table
Isolation, enforcing a near complete separation of the kernel and userspace
address maps and preventing the attack. This solution might have a performance
impact, and can be disabled at boot time by passing `pti=off' to the kernel
command line.</p>

<p>We also identified a regression for ancient userspaces using the vsyscall
interface, for example chroot and containers using (e)glibc 2.13 and older,
including those based on Debian 7 or RHEL/CentOS 6. This regression will be
fixed in a later update.</p>

<p>The other vulnerabilities (named Spectre) published at the same time are not
addressed in this update and will be fixed in a later update.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem will be fixed in a
separate update.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.9.65-3+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
