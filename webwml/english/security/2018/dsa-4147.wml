<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight
crypto and SSL/TLS library, that allowed a remote attacker to either
cause a denial-of-service by application crash, or execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.3.9-2.1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of polarssl please refer to
