<p>Etienne Stalmans discovered that git, a fast, scalable, distributed
revision control system, is prone to an arbitrary code execution
vulnerability exploitable via specially crafted submodule names in a
.gitmodules file.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:2.1.4-2.1+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.11.0-3+deb9u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your git packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of git please refer to its security
tracker page at:
