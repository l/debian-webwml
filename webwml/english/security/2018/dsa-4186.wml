<p>It was discovered that gunicorn, an event-based HTTP/WSGI server was
susceptible to HTTP Response splitting.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 19.0-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gunicorn packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of gunicorn please refer to
