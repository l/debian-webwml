<p>It was discovered that the webhook validation of Anymail, a Django email
backends for multiple ESPs, is prone to a timing attack. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw to obtain a
WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION secret and post arbitrary email tracking events.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your django-anymail packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of django-anymail please refer to its
