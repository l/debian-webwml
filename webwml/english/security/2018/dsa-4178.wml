<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in LibreOffice's code to parse
MS Word and Structured Storage files, which could result in denial of
service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed
file is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u11.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.2.7-1+deb9u4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>
