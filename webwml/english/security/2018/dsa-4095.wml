<p>It was discovered that gcab, a Microsoft Cabinet file manipulation tool,
is prone to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability when extracting
.cab files. An attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a
denial-of-service or, potentially the execution of arbitrary code with
the privileges of the user running gcab, if a specially crafted .cab
file is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gcab packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of gcab please refer to its security
tracker page at:
