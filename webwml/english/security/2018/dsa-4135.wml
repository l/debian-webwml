<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,
print, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1050">CVE-2018-1050</a>

    <p>It was discovered that Samba is prone to a denial of service
    attack when the RPC spoolss service is configured to be run as an
    external daemon.</p>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1057">CVE-2018-1057</a>

    <p>Bjoern Baumbach from Sernet discovered that on Samba 4 AD DC the
    LDAP server incorrectly validates permissions to modify passwords
    over LDAP allowing authenticated users to change any other users
    passwords, including administrative users.</p>

    <p><a href="https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/CVE-2018-1057">CVE-2018-1057</a></p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), CVE-2018-1050 will be addressed
in a later update. Unfortunately the changes required to fix
CVE-2018-1057 for Debian oldstable are too invasive to be backported.
Users using Samba as an AD-compatible domain controller are encouraged
to apply the workaround described in the Samba wiki and upgrade to
Debian stretch.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:4.5.12+dfsg-2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
