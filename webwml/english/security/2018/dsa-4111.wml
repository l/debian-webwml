<p>Mikhail Klementev, Ronnie Goodrich and Andrew Krasichkov discovered that
missing restrictions in the implementation of the WEBSERVICE function
in LibreOffice could result in the disclosure of arbitrary files
readable by the user who opens a malformed document.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:5.2.7-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libreoffice please refer to
its security tracker page at:
