<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mbed TLS, a lightweight
crypto and SSL/TLS library, that allowed a remote attacker to either
cause a denial-of-service by application crash, or execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mbedtls packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of mbedtls please refer to
its security tracker page at:
