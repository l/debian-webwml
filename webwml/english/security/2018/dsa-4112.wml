<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17563">CVE-2017-17563</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered that an incorrect reference count overflow
    check in x86 shadow mode may result in denial of service or
    privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17564">CVE-2017-17564</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered that improper x86 shadow mode reference count
    error handling may result in denial of service or privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17565">CVE-2017-17565</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered that an incomplete bug check in x86 log-dirty
    handling may result in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17566">CVE-2017-17566</a>

    <p>Jan Beulich discovered that x86 PV guests may gain access to
    internally used pages which could result in denial of service or
    potential privilege escalation.</p>

</ul>

<p>In addition this update ships the <q>Comet</q> shim to address the Meltdown
class of vulnerabilities for guests with legacy PV kernels. In addition,
the package provides the <q>Xen PTI stage 1</q> mitigation which is built-in
and enabled by default on Intel systems, but can be disabled with
`xpti=false' on the hypervisor command line (It does not make sense to
use both xpti and the Comet shim.)</p>

<p>Please refer to the following URL for more details on how to configure
individual mitigation strategies:

https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html</a></p>

<p>Additional information can also be found in README.pti and README.comet.</p></li>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.8.3+comet2+shim4.10.0+comet3-1+deb9u4.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
