<p>Richard Zhu discovered that an out-of-bounds memory write in the
codeboook parsing code of the Libvorbis multimedia library could result
in the execution of arbitrary code if a malformed Vorbis file is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.4-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvorbis packages.</p>
