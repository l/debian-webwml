<p>Jonas Klempel reported that tomcat-native, a library giving Tomcat
access to the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library's network connection
(socket) implementation and random-number generator, does not properly
handle fields longer than 127 bytes when parsing the AIA-Extension field
of a client certificate. If OCSP checks are used, this could result in
client certificates that should have been rejected to be accepted.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.1.32~repack-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat-native packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of tomcat-native please refer to its
security tracker page at:
