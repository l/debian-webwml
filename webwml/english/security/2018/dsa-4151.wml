<p>Bas van Schaik and Kevin Backhouse discovered a stack-based buffer
overflow vulnerability in librelp, a library providing reliable event
logging over the network, triggered while checking x509 certificates
from a peer. A remote attacker able to connect to rsyslog can take
advantage of this flaw for remote code execution by sending a specially
crafted x509 certificate.</p>

<p>Details can be found in the upstream advisory:
<a href="http://www.rsyslog.com/cve-2018-1000140/">http://www.rsyslog.com/cve-2018-1000140/</a></p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.2.7-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.12-1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your librelp packages.</p>
