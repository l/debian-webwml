<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000024">CVE-2018-1000024</a>

    <p>Louis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid does not properly handle
    processing of certain ESI responses. A remote server delivering
    certain ESI response syntax can take advantage of this flaw to cause
    a denial of service for all clients accessing the Squid service.
    This problem is limited to the Squid custom ESI parser.</p>

    <p>Louis Dion-Marcil discovered that Squid is prone to a denial of
    service vulnerability when processing ESI responses or downloading
    intermediate CA certificates. A remote attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a denial of service for all clients accessing
    the Squid service.</p>
