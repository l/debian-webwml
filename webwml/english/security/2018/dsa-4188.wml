<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>

    <p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.</p>

    <p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 2 (branch
    target injection) and is mitigated for the x86 architecture (amd64
    and i386) by using the <q>retpoline</q> compiler feature which allows
    indirect branches to be isolated from speculative execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-5753">CVE-2017-5753</a>

    <p>Multiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in various
    processors supporting speculative execution, enabling an attacker
    controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from arbitrary
    addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes
    running on the system.</p>

    <p>This specific attack has been named Spectre variant 1
    (bounds-check bypass) and is mitigated by identifying vulnerable
    code sections (array bounds checking followed by array access) and
    replacing the array access with the speculation-safe
    array_index_nospec() function.</p>

    <p>More use sites will be added over time.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-17975">CVE-2017-17975</a>

    <p>Tuba Yavuz reported a use-after-free flaw in the USBTV007
    audio-video grabber driver. A local user could use this for denial
    of service by triggering failure of audio registration.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18193">CVE-2017-18193</a>

    <p>Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    handle extent trees, allowing a local user to cause a denial of
    service via an application with multiple threads.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18216">CVE-2017-18216</a>

    <p>Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem failed to hold a
    necessary lock during nodemanager sysfs file operations,
    potentially leading to a null pointer dereference.  A local user
    could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18218">CVE-2017-18218</a>

    <p>Jun He reported a use-after-free flaw in the Hisilicon HNS ethernet
    driver. A local user could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18222">CVE-2017-18222</a>

    <p>It was reported that the Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) driver
    implementation does not properly handle ethtool private flags. A
    local user could use this for denial of service or possibly have
    other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18224">CVE-2017-18224</a>

    <p>Alex Chen reported that the OCFS2 filesystem omits the use of a
    semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the
    extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode. A local user
    could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18241">CVE-2017-18241</a>

    <p>Yunlei He reported that the f2fs implementation does not properly
    initialise its state if the <q>noflush_merge</q> mount option is used.
    A local user with access to a filesystem mounted with this option
    could use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-18257">CVE-2017-18257</a>

    <p>It was reported that the f2fs implementation is prone to an infinite
    loop caused by an integer overflow in the __get_data_block()
    function. A local user can use this for denial of service via
    crafted use of the open and fallocate system calls with an
    FS_IOC_FIEMAP ioctl.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1065">CVE-2018-1065</a>

    <p>The syzkaller tool found a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    netfilter subsystem when handling certain malformed iptables
    rulesets. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW or CAP_NET_ADMIN
    capability (in any user namespace) could use this to cause a denial
    of service. Debian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1066">CVE-2018-1066</a>

    <p>Dan Aloni reported to Red Hat that the CIFS client implementation
    would dereference a null pointer if the server sent an invalid
    response during NTLMSSP setup negotiation.  This could be used
    by a malicious server for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1068">CVE-2018-1068</a>

    <p>The syzkaller tool found that the 32-bit compatibility layer of
    ebtables did not sufficiently validate offset values. On a 64-bit
    kernel, a local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user
    namespace) could use this to overwrite kernel memory, possibly
    leading to privilege escalation. Debian disables unprivileged user
    namespaces by default.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1092">CVE-2018-1092</a>

    <p>Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image would
    trigger a null dereference when mounted.  A local user able
    to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1093">CVE-2018-1093</a>

    <p>Wen Xu reported that a crafted ext4 filesystem image could trigger
    an out-of-bounds read in the ext4_valid_block_bitmap() function. A
    local user able to mount arbitrary filesystems could use this for
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1108">CVE-2018-1108</a>

    <p>Jann Horn reported that crng_ready() does not properly handle the
    crng_init variable states and the RNG could be treated as
    cryptographically safe too early after system boot.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-5803">CVE-2018-5803</a>

    <p>Alexey Kodanev reported that the SCTP protocol did not range-check
    the length of chunks to be created.  A local or remote user could
    use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7480">CVE-2018-7480</a>

    <p>Hou Tao discovered a double-free flaw in the blkcg_init_queue()
    function in block/blk-cgroup.c. A local user could use this to cause
    a denial of service or have other impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7566">CVE-2018-7566</a>

    <p>Fan LongFei reported a race condition in the ALSA (sound)
    sequencer core, between write and ioctl operations.  This could
    lead to an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free.  A local user
    with access to a sequencer device could use this for denial of
    service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7740">CVE-2018-7740</a>

    <p>Nic Losby reported that the hugetlbfs filesystem's mmap operation
    did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local user with
    access to files on a hugetlbfs filesystem could use this to cause
    a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7757">CVE-2018-7757</a>

    <p>Jason Yan reported a memory leak in the SAS (Serial-Attached
    SCSI) subsystem.  A local user on a system with SAS devices
    could use this to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-7995">CVE-2018-7995</a>

    <p>Seunghun Han reported a race condition in the x86 MCE
    (Machine Check Exception) driver.  This is unlikely to have
    any security impact.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8087">CVE-2018-8087</a>

    <p>A memory leak flaw was found in the hwsim_new_radio_nl() function in
    the simulated radio testing tool driver for mac80211, allowing a
    local user to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8781">CVE-2018-8781</a>

    <p>Eyal Itkin reported that the udl (DisplayLink) driver's mmap
    operation did not properly range-check the file offset.  A local
    user with access to a udl framebuffer device could exploit this to
    overwrite kernel memory, leading to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-8822">CVE-2018-8822</a>

    <p>Dr Silvio Cesare of InfoSect reported that the ncpfs client
    implementation did not validate reply lengths from the server.  An
    ncpfs server could use this to cause a denial of service or
    remote code execution in the client.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-10323">CVE-2018-10323</a>

    <p>Wen Xu reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the
    xfs_bmapi_write() function triggered when mounting and operating a
    crafted xfs filesystem image. A local user able to mount arbitrary
    filesystems could use this for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-1000199">CVE-2018-1000199</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the ptrace subsystem did not
    sufficiently validate hardware breakpoint settings.  Local users
    can use this to cause a denial of service, or possibly for
    privilege escalation, on x86 (amd64 and i386) and possibly other
    architectures.</p></li>
