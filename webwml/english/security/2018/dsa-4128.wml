<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Apache Traffic Server, a
reverse and forward proxy server. They could lead to the use of an
incorrect upstream proxy, or allow a remote attacker to cause a
denial-of-service by application crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.0-6+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trafficserver packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of trafficserver please refer to
its security tracker page at:
