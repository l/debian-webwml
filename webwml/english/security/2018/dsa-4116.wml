<p>Krzysztof Sieluzycki discovered that the notifier for removable devices
in the KDE Plasma workspace performed insufficient sanitisation of
FAT/VFAT volume labels, which could result in the execution of arbitrary
shell commands if a removable device with a malformed disk label is
mounted.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4:5.8.6-2.1+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your plasma-workspace packages.</p>
