<p>Marios Nicolaides discovered that the PHP plugin in uWSGI, a fast,
self-healing application container server, does not properly handle a
DOCUMENT_ROOT check during use of the --php-docroot option, allowing a
remote attacker to mount a directory traversal attack and gain
unauthorized read access to sensitive files located outside of the web
root directory.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.7-1+deb8u2. This update additionally includes the fix for
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-6758">\
CVE-2018-6758</a> which was aimed to be addressed in the upcoming jessie
point release.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.14+20161117-3+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your uwsgi packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of uwsgi please refer to its security
tracker page at:
