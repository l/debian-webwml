<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered a vulnerability in the Transmission BitTorrent
client; insecure RPC handling between the Transmission daemon and the
client interface(s) may result in the execution of arbitrary code if a
user visits a malicious website while Transmission is running.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.84-0.2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.92-2+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your transmission packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of transmission please refer to
