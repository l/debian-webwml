<p>It was discovered that a race condition in beep (if configured as setuid
via debconf) allows local privilege escalation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your beep packages.</p>
