<p>Two vulnerabilities were discovered in the libraries of the Vorbis audio
compression codec, which could result in denial of service or the
execution of arbitrary code if a malformed media file is processed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4+deb9u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvorbis packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libvorbis please refer to
