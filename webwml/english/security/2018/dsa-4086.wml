<p>Nick Wellnhofer discovered that certain function calls inside XPath
predicates can lead to use-after-free and double-free errors when
executed by libxml2's XPath engine via an XSLT transformation.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.9.1+dfsg1-5+deb8u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9.4+dfsg1-2.2+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml2 packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of libxml2 please refer to its security
tracker page at:
