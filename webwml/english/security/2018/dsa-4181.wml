<p>Andrea Basile discovered that the <q>archive</q> plugin in roundcube, a
skinnable AJAX based webmail solution for IMAP servers, does not
properly sanitize a user-controlled parameter, allowing a remote
attacker to inject arbitrary IMAP commands and perform malicious
actions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3+dfsg.1-4+deb9u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your roundcube packages.</p>

<p>For the detailed security status of roundcube please refer to its
security tracker page at:
