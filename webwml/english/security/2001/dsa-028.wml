<define-tag moreinfo>Styx has reported that the program `man' mistakenly passes
malicious strings (i.e. containing format characters) through routines that
were not meant to use them as format strings. Since this could cause a
segmentation fault and privileges were not dropped it may lead to an exploit
for the 'man' user. 

<p>We recommend you upgrade your man-db package immediately.</define-tag>
