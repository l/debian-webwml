<define-tag moreinfo>Christer Öberg of Wkit Security AB found a problem in joe
(Joe's Own Editor). joe will look for a configuration file in three locations:
The current directory, the users homedirectory ($HOME) and in /etc/joe. Since
the configuration file can define commands joe will run (for example to check
spelling) reading it from the current directory can be dangerous: An attacker
can leave a .joerc file in a writable directory, which would be read when a
unsuspecting user starts joe in that directory.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.8-15.3 and we recommend that you upgrade
your joe package immediately.</define-tag>
