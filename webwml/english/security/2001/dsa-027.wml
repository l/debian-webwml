<li>Versions of OpenSSH prior to 2.3.0 are vulnerable to a remote arbitrary
memory overwrite attack which may lead to a root exploit.
<li>CORE-SDI has described a problem with regards to RSA key exchange and a
Bleichenbacher attack to gather the session key from an ssh session. 
</ol>
Both of these issues have been corrected in our ssh package 1.2.3-9.2.

We recommend you upgrade your openssh package immediately.</define-tag>
