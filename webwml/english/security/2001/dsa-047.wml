The kernels used in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 have been found to have 
multiple security problems. This is a list of problems based 
on the 2.2.19 release notes as found on <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/">
http://www.linux.org.uk/</a>:

<p><ul>
<li>binfmt_misc used user pages directly
<li>the CPIA driver had an off-by-one error in the buffer code which made
  it possible for users to write into kernel memory
<li>the CPUID and MSR drivers had a problem in the module unloading code
  which could case a system crash if they were set to automatically load
  and unload (please note that Debian does not automatically unload kernel
  modules)
<li>There was a possible hang in the classifier code
<li>The getsockopt and setsockopt system calls did not handle sign bits
  correctly which made a local DoS and other attacks possible
<li>The sysctl system call did not handle sign bits correctly which allowed
  a user to write in kernel memory
<li>ptrace/exec races that could give a local user extra privileges
<li>possible abuse of a boundary case in the sockfilter code
<li>SYSV shared memory code could overwrite recently freed memory which might
  cause problems
<li>The packet length checks in the masquerading code were a bit lax
  (probably not exploitable)
<li>Some x86 assembly bugs caused the wrong number of bytes to be copied.
<li>A local user could deadlock the kernel due to bugs in the UDP port
  allocation.
</ul>

<p>All these problems are fixed in the 2.2.19 kernel, and it is highly
recommend that you upgrade machines to this kernel.

<p>Please note that kernel upgrades are not done automatically. You will
have to explicitly tell the packaging system to install the right kernel
for your system.
