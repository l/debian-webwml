Byrial Jensen found a nasty problem in slrn (a threaded news reader).
The notice on slrn-announce describes it as follows:

<blockquote>
<p>
    When trying to decode binaries, the built-in code executes any shell
    scripts the article might contain, apparently assuming they would be
    some kind of self-extracting archive.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 0.9.6.2-9potato2 by removing
this feature.
