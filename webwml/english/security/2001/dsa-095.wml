<define-tag moreinfo>
The package 'gpm' contains the 'gpm-root' program, which can be used to
create mouse-activated menus on the console.
Among other problems, the gpm-root program contains a format string
vulnerability, which allows an attacker to gain root privileges.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.17.8-18.1, and we recommend that you upgrade
your 1.17.8-18 package immediately.
