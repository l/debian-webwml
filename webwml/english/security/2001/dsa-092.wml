<define-tag description>local root exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
Nicolas Boullis found a nasty security problem in the wmtv (a
dockable video4linux TV player for windowmaker) package as
distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>wmtv can optionally run a command if you double-click on the TV
window. This command can be specified using the -e command line
option. However, since wmtv is installed suid root, this command
was also run as root, which gives local users a very simple way
to get root access.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.6.5-2potato1 by dropping root
privileges before executing the command. We recommend that you
upgrade your wmtv package immediately.
