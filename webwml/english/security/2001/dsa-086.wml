<define-tag description>remote root exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>We have received reports that the "SSH CRC-32 compensation attack
detector vulnerability" is being actively exploited. This is the same
integer type error previously corrected for OpenSSH in DSA-027-1.
OpenSSH (the Debian ssh package) was fixed at that time, but
ssh-nonfree and ssh-socks were not.</p>

<p>Though packages in the non-free section of the archive are not
officially supported by the Debian project, we are taking the unusual
step of releasing updated ssh-nonfree/ssh-socks packages for those
users who have not yet migrated to OpenSSH. However, we do recommend
that our users migrate to the regularly supported, DFSG-free "ssh"
package as soon as possible. ssh 1.2.3-9.3 is the OpenSSH package
available in Debian 2.2r4.</p>

<p>The fixed ssh-nonfree/ssh-socks packages are available in version
1.2.27-6.2 for use with Debian 2.2 (potato) and version 1.2.27-8 for
use with the Debian unstable/testing distribution. Note that the new
ssh-nonfree/ssh-socks packages remove the setuid bit from the ssh
binary, disabling rhosts-rsa authentication. If you need this
functionality, run</p>
<p><code>chmod u+s /usr/bin/ssh1</code></p>
<p>after installing the new package.</p>
