<define-tag moreinfo>The following problems have been reported for the version
of proftpd in Debian 2.2 (potato):

<ol>
<li>There is a configuration error in the postinst script, when the user enters
'yes', when asked if anonymous access should be enabled.  The postinst script
wrongly leaves the 'run as uid/gid root' configuration option in
/etc/proftpd.conf, and adds a 'run as uid/gid nobody' option that has no
effect.
<li>There is a bug that comes up when /var is a symlink, and proftpd is
restarted. When stopping proftpd, the /var symlink is removed; when it's
started again a file named /var is created.
</ol>

The above problems have been corrected in proftpd-1.2.0pre10-2.0potato1.  We
recommend you upgrade your proftpd package immediately.  </define-tag>
