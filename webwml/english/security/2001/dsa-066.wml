Steven van Acker reported on bugtraq that the version of cfingerd (a
configurable finger daemon) as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
suffers from two problems:

<ol>
<li>The code that reads configuration files (files in which $ commands are
   expanded) copied its input to a buffer without checking for a buffer
   overflow. When the ALLOW_LINE_PARSING feature is enabled that code
   is used for reading users' files as well, so local users could exploit
   this.

<li>There also was a printf call in the same routine that did not protect
   against printf format attacks.
</ol>

<p>Since ALLOW_LINE_PARSING is enabled in the default /etc/cfingerd.conf
local users could use this to gain root access.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.4.1-1.2, and we recommend that you upgrade
your cfingerd package immediately.
