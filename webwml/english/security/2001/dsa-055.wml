<define-tag moreinfo>
A new Zope hotfix has been released which fixes a problem in ZClasses.
The README for the 2001-05-01 hotfix describes the problem as `any user
can visit a ZClass declaration and change the ZClass permission mappings
for methods and other objects defined within the ZClass, possibly
allowing for unauthorized access within the Zope instance.'

<p>This hotfix has been added in version 2.1.6-10, and we highly recommend
that you upgrade your zope package immediately.
