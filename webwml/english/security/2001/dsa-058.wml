<define-tag description>remote printf format attack</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
Megyer Laszlo found a printf format bug in the exim mail transfer
agent. The code that checks the header syntax of an email logs
an error without protecting itself against printf format attacks.

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 3.12-10.1. Since that code is
not turned on by default a standard installation is not vulnerable,
but we still recommend to upgrade your exim package.
