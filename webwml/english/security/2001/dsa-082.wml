<define-tag description>Buffer Overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
Christophe Bailleux reported on <a href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/194473">\
bugtraq</a> that Xvt is vulnerable to a
buffer overflow in its argument handling.  Since Xvt is installed
setuid root, it was possible for a normal user to pass
carefully-crafted arguments to xvt so that xvt executed a root shell.

<p>This problem has been fixed by the maintainer in version 2.1-13 of xvt
for Debian unstable and 2.1-13.0potato.1 for the stable Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xvt package immediately.
