<define-tag moreinfo>
SecureNet Service reported that w3m (a console web browser) has a
buffer overflow in its MIME header parsing code. This could be exploited
by an attacker if by making a web-server a user visits return carefully
crafted MIME headers.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.1.10+0.1.11pre+kokb23-4, and we
recommend that you upgrade your w3m package.
