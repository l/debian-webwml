Stephane Gaudreault <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/97184">told
us</a> that version 2.0.6a of gftp displays the
password in plain text on the screen within the log window when it is
logging into an ftp server.  A malicious colleague who is watching the
screen could gain access to the users shell on the remote machine.

<p>This problem has been fixed by the Security Team in version 2.0.6a-3.2
for the stable Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gftp package.
