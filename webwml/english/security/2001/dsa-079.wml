<define-tag description>uucp uid/gid access</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
zen-parse has found a problem with Taylor UUCP as distributed with
many GNU/Linux distributions.  It was possible to make `uux' execute
`uucp' with malicious commandline arguments which gives an attacker
access to files owned by uid/gid uucp.

<p>This problem has been fixed in version of 1.06.1-11potato1 for Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2 by using a patch that RedHat has provided.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your uucp package immediately.
