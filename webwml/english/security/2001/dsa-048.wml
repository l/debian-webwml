Marcus Meissner discovered that samba was not creating temporary
files safely in two places:

<ul>
<li>when a remote user queried a printer queue samba would create a
    temporary file in which the queue data would be written. This was being
    done using a predictable filename, and insecurely, allowing a local
    attacker to trick samba into overwriting arbitrary files.
<li>smbclient "more" and "mput" commands also created temporary files
    in /tmp insecurely.
</ul>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 2.0.7-3.2, and we recommend
that you upgrade your samba package immediately. (This problem is also fixed
in the Samba 2.2 codebase.)

<p>Note: DSA-048-1 included an incorrectly compiled sparc package, which
the second edition fixed.
