If the UseLogin feature is enabled in for ssh local users could
pass environment variables (including variables like LD_PRELOAD)
to the login process. This has been fixed by not copying the
environment of UseLogin is enabled.

<p>Please note that the default configuration for Debian does not
have UseLogin enabled.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1:1.2.3-9.4.
