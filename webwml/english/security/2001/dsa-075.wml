<define-tag description>remote exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The telnet daemon contained in the netkit-telnet-ssl_0.16.3-1 package in
the 'stable' (potato) distribution of Debian GNU/Linux is vulnerable to an
exploitable overflow in its output handling.
The original bug was found by <scut@nb.in-berlin.de>, and announced to
bugtraq on Jul 18 2001. At that time, netkit-telnet versions after 0.14 were
not believed to be vulnerable.

<p>On Aug 10 2001, zen-parse posted an advisory based on the same problem, for
all netkit-telnet versions below 0.17.

<p>More details can be found on http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/203000 .
As Debian uses the 'telnetd' user to run in.telnetd, this is not a remote
root compromise on Debian systems; the 'telnetd' user can be compromised.

<p>We strongly advise you update your netkit-telnet-ssl packages to the versions
listed below.
