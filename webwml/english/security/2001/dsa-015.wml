<define-tag moreinfo>Versions of the sash package prior to 3.4-4 did not clone
/etc/shadow properly, causing it to be made world-readable.

This package only exists in stable, so if you are running unstable you won't
see a bugfix unless you use the resources from the bottom of this message to
the proper configuration.

We recommend you upgrade your sash package immediately.</define-tag>
