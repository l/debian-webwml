<define-tag moreinfo>
Samuel Dralet reported on bugtraq that version 2.6.2 of rxvt (a
VT102 terminal emulator for X) have a buffer overflow in the
<code>tt_printf()</code> function. A local user could abuse this making rxvt
print a special string using that function, for example by using
the <kbd>-T</kbd> or <kbd>-name</kbd> command-line options.
That string would cause a
stack overflow and contain code which rxvt will execute.

<p>Since rxvt is installed sgid utmp an attacker could use this
to gain utmp which would allow them to modify the utmp file.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.6.2-2.1, and we recommend that
you upgrade your rxvt package.
