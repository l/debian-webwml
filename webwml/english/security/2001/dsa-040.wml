<define-tag moreinfo>Bill Nottingham reported a problem in the
wrapping/unwrapping functions of the slrn newsreader. A long header in a
message might overflow a buffer, which could result in executing arbitrary
code encoded in the message.

<p>The default configuration does not have wrapping enable, but it can easily
be enabled either by changing the configuration or pressing W while viewing a
message.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.9.6.2-9potato1 and we recommand that you
upgrade your slrn package immediately.</define-tag>
