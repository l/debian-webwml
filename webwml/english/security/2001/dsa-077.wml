Vladimir Ivaschenko found a problem in squid (a popular proxy cache).
He discovered that there was a flaw in the code to handle FTP PUT
commands: when a mkdir-only request was done squid would detect
an internal error and exit. Since squid is configured to restart
itself on problems this is not a big problem.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.2.5-3.2. This problem is logged
as bug 233 in the squid bugtracker and will also be fixed in
future squid releases.
