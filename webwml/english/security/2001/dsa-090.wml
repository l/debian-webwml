<define-tag description>symlink attack</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The xtel (an X emulator for minitel) package as distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2 has two possible symlink attacks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>xteld creates a temporary file <tt>/tmp/.xtel-<var>&lt;user&gt;</var></tt>
  without checking for symlinks.</li>
  <li>when printing a hardcopy xtel would create a temporary file without
  protecting itself against symlink attacks.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 3.2.1-4.potato.1 .
