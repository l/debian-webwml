<define-tag moreinfo>
Salvatore Sanfilippo found two remotely exploitable problems in
<code>fetchmail</code> while doing a security audit. In both the IMAP code
and the POP3 code, the input isn't verified even though it's used to store
a number in an array. Since
no bounds checking is done this can be used by an attacker to write
arbitrary data in memory. An attacker can use this if they can get a user
to transfer mail from a custom IMAP or POP3 server they control.

<p>This has been fixed in version 5.3.3-3, we recommend that you
update your <code>fetchmail</code> packages immediately.
