<define-tag moreinfo>
Colin Phipps and Daniel Kobras discovered and fixed several serious
bugs in the saft daemon `sendfiled' which caused it to drop privileges
incorrectly.  Exploiting this a local user can easily make it execute
arbitrary code under root privileges.

<p>We recommend you upgrade your sendfile packages immediately.
