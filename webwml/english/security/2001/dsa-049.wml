Megyer Laszlo report on Bugtraq that the cfingerd daemon as distributed
with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 was not careful in its logging code. By
combining this with an off-by-one error in the code that copied the
username from an ident response cfingerd could be exploited by a remote
user. Since cfingerd does not drop its root privileges until after
it has determined which user to finger an attacker can gain
root privileges.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.4.1-1.1, and we recommend that you
upgrade your cfingerd package immediately.

<p>Note: this advisory was previously posted as DSA-048-1 by mistake.
