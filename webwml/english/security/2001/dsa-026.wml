<define-tag moreinfo>BIND 8 suffered from several buffer overflows. It is
possible to construct an inverse query that allows the stack to be read
remotely exposing environment variables. CERT has disclosed information about
these issues. A new upstream version fixes this. Due to the complexity of BIND
we have decided to make an exception to our rule by releasing the new upstream
source to our stable distribution. We recommend you upgrade your bind packages
immediately.</define-tag>
