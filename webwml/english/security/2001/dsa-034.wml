<define-tag moreinfo>Fumitoshi Ukai and Denis Barbier have found several
potential buffer overflow bugs in our version of ePerl as distributed in all of
our distributions.  

<p>When eperl is installed setuid root, it can switch to the UID/GID of
the scripts owner.  Although Debian doesn't ship the program setuid
root, this is a useful feature which people may have activated
locally.  When the program is used as /usr/lib/cgi-bin/nph-eperl the
bugs could lead into a remote vulnerability as well.

<p>Version 2.2.14-0.7potato2 fixes this; we recommend you upgrade your eperl
package immediately.  </define-tag>
