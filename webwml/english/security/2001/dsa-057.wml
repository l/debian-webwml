<define-tag description>printf format attack</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The gftp package as distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 has a problem
in its logging code: it logged data received from the network but it did
not protect itself from printf format attacks. An attacker can use this
by making a FTP server return special responses that exploit this.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.0.6a-3.1, and we recommend that you
upgrade your gftp package.
