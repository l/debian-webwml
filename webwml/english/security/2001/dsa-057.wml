<define-tag description>printf format attack</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The gftp package as distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 has a problem
in its logging code: it logged data received from the network but it did
not protect itself from printf format attacks. An attacker can use this
by making an FTP server return special responses that exploit this.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.0.6a-3.1, and we recommend that you
upgrade your gftp package.
