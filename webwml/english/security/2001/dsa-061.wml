<define-tag description>printf format attack</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of GnuPG (GNU Privacy Guard, an OpenPGP implementation)
as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 suffers from two problems:

<ol>
<li>fish stiqz reported on bugtraq that there was a printf format
problem in the do_get() function: it printed a prompt which included
the filename that was being decrypted without checking for
possible printf format attacks. This could be exploited by tricking
someone into decrypting a file with a specially crafted filename.

<li>The second bug is related to importing secret keys: when gnupg
imported a secret key it would immediately make the associated
public key fully trusted which changes your web of trust without
asking for a confirmation. To fix this you now need a special
option to import a secret key.
</ol>

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 1.0.6-0potato1.
