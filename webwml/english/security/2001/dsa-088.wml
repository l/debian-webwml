<define-tag description>improper character escaping</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The fml (a mailing list package) as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
suffers from a cross-site scripting problem. When generating index
pages for list archives the `&lt;' and `&gt;' characters were not properly
escaped for subjects.

<p>This has been fixed in version 3.0+beta.20000106-5, and we recommend
that you upgrade your fml package to that version. Upgrading will
automatically regenerate the index pages.
