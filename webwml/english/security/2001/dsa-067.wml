<define-tag moreinfo>

We have received reports that the `apache' package, as included in
the Debian `stable' distribution, is vulnerable to the `artificially
long slash path directory listing vulnerability' as described on <a
href="http://www.securityfocus.com/vdb/bottom.html?vid=2503">SecurityFocus</a>.

<p>This vulnerability was announced to bugtraq by Dan Harkless.

<p>Quoting the SecurityFocus entry for this vulnerability:

<blockquote>
 <p>A problem in the package could allow directory indexing, and path
 discovery. In a default configuration, Apache enables mod_dir,
 mod_autoindex, and mod_negotiation. However, by placing a custom
 crafted request to the Apache server consisting of a long path name
 created artificially by using numerous slashes, this can cause these
 modules to misbehave, making it possible to escape the error page,
 and gain a listing of the directory contents.

 <p>This vulnerability makes it possible for a malicious remote user
 to launch an information gathering attack, which could potentially
 result in compromise of the system. Additionally, this vulnerability
 affects all releases of Apache previous to 1.3.19.
</blockquote>

<p>This problem has been fixed in apache-ssl 1.3.9-13.3 and
apache 1.3.9-14.  We recommend that you upgrade your packages
immediately.</p>

<p>Warning: The MD5Sum of the .dsc and .diff.gz file don't match
since they were copied from the stable release afterwards, the
content of the .diff.gz file is the same, though, checked.</p>
