<define-tag description>broken dropping of privileges</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
Daniel Kobras has discovered and fixed a problem in sendfiled which
caused the daemon not to drop privileges as expected when sending
notification mails. Exploiting this, a local user can easily make it
execute arbitrary code under root privileges.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sendfile package immediately.
