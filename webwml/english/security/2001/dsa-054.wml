<define-tag description>local root exploit</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
A recent (fall 2000) security fix to cron introduced an error in giving
up privileges before invoking the editor. This was discovered by Sebastian
Krahmer from SuSE. A malicious user could easily gain root access.

<p>This has been fixed in version 3.0pl1-57.3 (or 3.0pl1-67 for unstable).
No exploits are known to exist, but we recommend that you upgrade your
cron packages immediately.
