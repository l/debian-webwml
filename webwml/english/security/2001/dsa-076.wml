<define-tag moreinfo>
Pavel Machek has found a buffer overflow in the `most' pager program.
The problem is part of most's tab expansion where the program would
write beyond the bounds two array variables when viewing a malicious
file.  This could lead into other data structures being overwritten
which in turn could enable most to execute arbitrary code being able
to compromise the users environment.

<p>This has been fixed in the upstream version 4.9.2 and an updated
version of 4.9.0 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your most package immediately.
