<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of <code>xloadimage</code> (a graphics files viewer for X) that was
shipped in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 has a buffer overflow in the code that
handles FACES format images. This could be exploited by an attacker by
tricking someone into viewing a specially crafted image using <code>xloadimage</code>
which would allow them to execute arbitrary code.

<p>This problem was fixed in version 4.1-5potato1.
