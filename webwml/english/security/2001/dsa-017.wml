<define-tag moreinfo>With older versions of jazip a user could gain root
access for members of the floppy group to the local machine. The interface
doesn't run as root anymore and this very exploit was prevented. The program
now also truncates DISPLAY to 256 characters if it is bigger, which closes the
buffer overflow (within xforms). 
<p>We recommend you upgrade your jazip package immediately. </define-tag>
