Luki R. reported a bug in man-db: it did handle nested calls of
drop_effective_privs() and regain_effective_privs() correctly which
would cause it to regain privileges too early. This could be abused
to make man create files as user man.

<p>This has been fixed in version 2.3.16-4, and we recommend that you 
upgrade your man-db package immediately. If you use suidmanager you 
can also use that to make sure man and mandb are not installed suid
which protects you from this problem. This can be done with the
following commands:

<pre>
   suidregister /usr/lib/man-db/man root root 0755
   suidregister /usr/lib/man-db/mandb root root 0755
</pre>

<p>    
Of course even when using suidmanager an upgrade is still strongly 
recommended.
