<define-tag moreinfo>
Wolfram Kleff found a problem in fetchmail: it would crash when
processing emails with extremely long headers. The problem was
a buffer overflow in the header parser which could be exploited.

<p>This has been fixed in version 5.3.3-1.2, and we recommend that
you upgrade your fetchmail package immediately.
