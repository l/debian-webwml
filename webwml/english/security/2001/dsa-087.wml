<define-tag moreinfo>
CORE ST reports that an exploit has been found for a bug in the wu-ftpd
glob code (this is the code that handles filename wildcard expansion).
Any logged in user (including anonymous FTP users) can exploit the bug
to gain root privileges on the server. 

<p>This has been corrected in version 2.6.0-6 of the wu-ftpd package.
