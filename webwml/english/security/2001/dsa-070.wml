The netkit-telnet daemon contained in the <code>telnetd</code> package version
0.16-4potato1, which is shipped with
the "stable" (2.2, potato) distribution of Debian GNU/Linux, is vulnerable to an
exploitable overflow in its output handling.

<p>
The original bug was found by &lt;scut@nb.in-berlin.de&gt;, and announced to
bugtraq on Jul 18 2001. At that time, netkit-telnet versions after 0.14 were
not believed to be vulnerable.

<p>
On Aug 10 2001, zen-parse posted an advisory based on the same problem, for
all netkit-telnet versions below 0.17.

<p>
More details can be found on <a href="http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/203000">http://online.securityfocus.com/archive/1/203000</a>.
As Debian uses the `telnetd' user to run <code>in.telnetd</code>, this is not a remote
root compromise on Debian systems; however, the user `telnetd' can be compromised.

<p>We strongly advise you update your <code>telnetd</code> package to the versions
listed below.
