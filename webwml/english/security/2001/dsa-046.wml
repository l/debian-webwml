Colin Phipps discovered that the exuberant-ctags packages as distributed
with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 creates temporary files insecurely. This has
been fixed in version 1:3.2.4-0.1 of the Debian package, and upstream
version 3.5.

<p>Note: DSA-046-1 included an incorrectly compiled sparc package, which
the second edition fixed.
