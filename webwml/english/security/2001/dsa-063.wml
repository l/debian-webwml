<define-tag description>change default umask</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
zen-parse reported on bugtraq that there is a possible buffer overflow
in the logging code from xinetd. This could be triggered by using a
fake identd that returns special replies when xinetd does an ident
request. 

<p>Another problem is that xinetd sets it umask to 0. As a result any
programs that xinetd start that are not careful with file permissions
will create world-writable files.

<p>Both problems have been fixed in version 2.1.8.8.p3-1.1.
