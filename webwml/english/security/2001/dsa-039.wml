<define-tag moreinfo>The version of GNU libc that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2 suffered from 2 security problems:

<ul>
<li>It was possible to use LD_PRELOAD to load libraries that are listed in
/etc/ld.so.cache, even for suid programs. This could be used to create (and
overwrite) files which a user should not be allowed to.
<li>By using LD_PROFILE suid programs would write data to a file to /var/tmp,
which was not done safely. Again, this could be  used to create (and overwrite)
files which a user should not have access to.
</ul>

Both problems have been fixed in version 2.1.3-17 and we recommend that
you upgrade your glibc packages immediately.

<p>Please note that a side-effect of this upgrade is that ldd will no longer
work on suid programs, unless you logged in as root.
