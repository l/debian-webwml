<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>In <a href="http://www.lac.co.jp/security/english/snsadv_e/32_e.html">\
SNS Advisory No. 32</a> a buffer overflow vulnerability has been
reported in the routine which parses MIME headers that are returned
from web servers.  A malicious web server administrator could exploit
this and let the client web browser execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>w3m handles MIME headers included in the request/response message of
HTTP communication like any other web browser.  A buffer overflow will
be occur when w3m receives a MIME encoded header with base64 format.</p>

<p>This problem has been fixed by the maintainer in version
0.1.10+0.1.11pre+kokb23-4 of w3m and w3m-ssl (for the SSL-enabled
version), both for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your w3m packages immediately.</p>
