<define-tag moreinfo>
CERT released their advisory CA-2001-18 which lists a number of
vulnerabilities in various LDAP implementations. based on the 
results of the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite. These tests found one
problem in OpenLDAP, a free LDAP implementation that is shipped
as part of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>The problem is that slapd did not handle packets with an invalid
BER length of length fields and would crash if it received those.
An attacked can use this to mount a denial of service attack
remotely.

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.11-1, and we recommend
that you upgrade your slapd package immediately.
