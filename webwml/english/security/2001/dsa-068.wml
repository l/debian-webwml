<define-tag moreinfo>
The CERT advisory  lists a number of vulnerabilities in various
LDAP implementations, based on the 
results of the PROTOS LDAPv3 test suite. These tests found one
problem in OpenLDAP, a free LDAP implementation which is shipped
as part of Debian GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>The problem is that <code>slapd</code> did not handle packets which had
BER fields of invalid length and would crash if it received them.
An attacker could use this to mount a remote denial of service attack.

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.12-1, and we recommend
that you upgrade your <code>slapd</code> package immediately.
