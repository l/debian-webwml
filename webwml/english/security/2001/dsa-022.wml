<define-tag moreinfo>Former versions of the exmh program used /tmp for storing
temporary files. No checks were made to ensure that nobody placed a symlink
with the same name in /tmp in the meantime and thus was vulnerable to a symlink
attack. This could lead to a malicious local user being able to overwrite any
file writable by the user executing exmh. Upstream developers have reported and
fixed this. The exmh program now use /tmp/login unless TMPDIR or EXMHTMPDIR
is set. 

<p>We recommend you upgrade your exmh packages immediately.</define-tag>
