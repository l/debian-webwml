<define-tag description>unauthorized gathering of data</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
Nergal reported a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=458013&amp;group_id=4593&amp;atid=104593">\
vulnerability</a> in the htsearch program which is
distributed as part of the ht://Dig package, a indexing and searching
system for small domains or intranets.  Using former versions it was
able to pass the parameter <kbd>-c</kbd> to the cgi program in order to use a
different configuration file.

<p>A malicious user could point htsearch to a file like
<var>/dev/zero</var> and
let the server run in an endless loop, trying to read config
parameters.  If the user has write permission on the server he can
point the program to it and retrive any file readable by the webserver
user id.

<p>This problem has been fixed in version 3.1.5-2.0potato.1 for Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2.

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your htdig package immediately.
