<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client:  multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code or denial of service. This update also
addresses a vulnerability in DHE key processing commonly known as
the <q>LogJam</q> vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 31.8.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.8.0-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
