<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0817">CVE-2015-0817</a>

    <p>ilxu1a reported a flaw in Mozilla's implementation of typed array
    bounds checking in JavaScript just-in-time compilation (JIT) and its
    management of bounds checking for heap access. This flaw can be
    leveraged into the reading and writing of memory allowing for
    arbitary code execution on the local system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0818">CVE-2015-0818</a>

    <p>Mariusz Mlynski discovered a method to run arbitrary scripts in a
    privileged context. This bypassed the same-origin policy protections
    by using a flaw in the processing of SVG format content navigation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.5.3esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.5.3esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
