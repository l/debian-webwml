<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.51 does not validate that a point
is within the elliptic curve, which makes it easier for remote attackers
to obtain private keys via a series of crafted elliptic curve Diffie
Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges, aka an "invalid curve attack."</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, this issue has been fixed in version
1.44+dfsg-2+deb6u1 of bouncycastle.</p>

<p>Many thanks to upstream author Peter Dettmann who reviewed the backport
that we prepared.</p>
