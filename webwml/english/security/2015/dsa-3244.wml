<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ownCloud, a cloud storage
web service for files, music, contacts, calendars and many more.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3011">CVE-2015-3011</a>

    <p>Hugh Davenport discovered that the <q>contacts</q> application shipped
    with ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site
    scripting attacks. This vulnerability is effectively exploitable
    in any browser.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3012">CVE-2015-3012</a>

    <p>Roy Jansen discovered that the <q>documents</q> application shipped with
    ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting
    attacks. This vulnerability is not exploitable in browsers that
    support the current CSP standard.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3013">CVE-2015-3013</a>

    <p>Lukas Reschke discovered a blacklist bypass vulnerability, allowing
    authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and
    upload files such as the .htaccess files. An attacker could leverage
    this bypass by uploading a .htaccess and execute arbitrary PHP code
    if the /data/ directory is stored inside the web root and a web
    server that interprets .htaccess files is used. On default Debian
    installations the data directory is outside of the web root and thus
    this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-4~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 7.0.4+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your owncloud packages.</p>
