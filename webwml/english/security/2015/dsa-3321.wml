<p>The InCommon Shibboleth Training team discovered that XMLTooling, a
C++ XML parsing library, did not properly handle an exception when
parsing well-formed but schema-invalid XML. This could allow remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted XML data.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.2-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmltooling packages.</p>
