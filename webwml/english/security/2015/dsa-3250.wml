<p>Multiple security issues have been discovered in Wordpress, a weblog
manager, that could allow remote attackers to upload files with invalid
or unsafe names, mount social engineering attacks or compromise a site
via cross-site scripting, and inject SQL commands.</p>

<p>More information can be found in the upstream advisories at
<url "https://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/wordpress-4-1-2/" /> and

in version 3.6.1+dfsg-1~deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1+dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed in
