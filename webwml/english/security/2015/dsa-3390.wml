<p>It was discovered that the code to validate level 2 page table entries
is bypassed when certain conditions are satisfied. A malicious PV guest
administrator can take advantage of this flaw to gain privileges via a
crafted superpage mapping.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.1.4-3+deb7u9.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.1-9+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
