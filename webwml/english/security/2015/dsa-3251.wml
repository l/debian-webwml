<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Nick Sampanis discovered that dnsmasq, a small caching DNS proxy and
DHCP/TFTP server, did not properly check the return value of the
setup_reply() function called during a TCP connection, which is used
then as a size argument in a function which writes data on the client's
connection. A remote attacker could exploit this issue via a specially
crafted DNS request to cause dnsmasq to crash, or potentially to obtain
sensitive information from process memory.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.62-3+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.72-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dnsmasq packages.</p>
