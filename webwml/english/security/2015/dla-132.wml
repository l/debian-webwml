<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3570">CVE-2014-3570</a>

    <p>Pieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring
    (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which
    might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3571">CVE-2014-3571</a>

    <p>Markus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully
    crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due
    to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw
    to mount a denial of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3572">CVE-2014-3572</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
    OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
    ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This
    allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks
    and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8275">CVE-2014-8275</a>

    <p>Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project
    and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate
    fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a
    fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0204">CVE-2015-0204</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that
    an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a
    non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS
    standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security
    of the session.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in openssl version 0.9.8o-4squeeze19</p>
