<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several bugs were discovered in PostgreSQL, a relational database server
system.  The 8.4 branch is EOLed upstream, but still present in Debian squeeze.
This new LTS minor version contains the fixes that were applied upstream to the
9.0.22 version, backported to 8.4.22 which was the last version officially
released by the PostgreSQL developers.  This LTS effort for squeeze-lts is a
community project sponsored by credativ GmbH.</p>

<h3>Migration to Version 8.4.22lts5</h3>

<p>A dump/restore is not required for those running 8.4.X.  However, if you are
upgrading from a version earlier than 8.4.22, see the relevant release notes.</p>

<h3>Security Fixes</h3>

<p>Fix contrib/pgcrypto to detect and report too-short crypt salts (Josh
Kupershmidt)</p>

<p>Certain invalid salt arguments crashed the server or disclosed a few
bytes of server memory. We have not ruled out the viability of attacks
that arrange for presence of confidential information in the disclosed
bytes, but they seem unlikely. (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5288">CVE-2015-5288</a>)</p>
