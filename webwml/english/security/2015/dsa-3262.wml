<p>Jason Geffner discovered a buffer overflow in the emulated floppy
disk drive, resulting in the potential execution of arbitrary code.
This only affects HVM guests.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.1.4-3+deb7u6.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (jessie) is already fixed through the qemu
update provided as DSA-3259-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xen packages.</p>
