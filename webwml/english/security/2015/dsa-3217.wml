<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jann Horn discovered that the source package integrity verification in
dpkg-source can be bypassed via a specially crafted Debian source
control file (.dsc). Note that this flaw only affects extraction of
local Debian source packages via dpkg-source but not the installation of
packages from the Debian archive.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.16.16. This update also includes non-security changes
previously scheduled for the next wheezy point release. See the Debian
changelog for details.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.25.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
