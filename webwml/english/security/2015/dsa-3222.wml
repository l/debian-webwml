<p>Miroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,
an alternative NTP client and server:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1821">CVE-2015-1821</a>

    <p>Using particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control
    would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1822">CVE-2015-1822</a>

    <p>When allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated
    command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could
    trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1853">CVE-2015-1853</a>

    <p>When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
    association, the internal state variables would be updated before the
    MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
    between NTP peers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.24-3.1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.30-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chrony packages.</p>
