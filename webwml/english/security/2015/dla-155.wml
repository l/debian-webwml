<p>This update fixes the CVEs described below.</p>

<p>A further issue, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9419">CVE-2014-9419</a>, was considered, but appears to require
extensive changes with a consequent high risk of regression.  It is
now unlikely to be fixed in squeeze-lts.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-6885">CVE-2013-6885</a>

    <p>It was discovered that under specific circumstances, a combination
    of write operations to write-combined memory and locked CPU
    instructions may cause a core hang on AMD 16h 00h through 0Fh
    processors. A local user can use this flaw to mount a denial of
    service (system hang) via a crafted application.</p>

    <p>For more information please refer to the AMD CPU erratum 793 in
    <a href="http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf">http://support.amd.com/TechDocs/51810_16h_00h-0Fh_Rev_Guide.pdf</a></p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7822">CVE-2014-7822</a>

    <p>It was found that the splice() system call did not validate the
    given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
    this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
    possibly other effects.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8133">CVE-2014-8133</a>

    <p>It was found that the espfix functionality can be bypassed by
    installing a 16-bit RW data segment into GDT instead of LDT (which
    espfix checks for) and using it for stack. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8134">CVE-2014-8134</a>

    <p>It was found that the espfix functionality is wrongly disabled in
    a 32-bit KVM guest. A local unprivileged user could potentially
    use this flaw to leak kernel stack addresses.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8160">CVE-2014-8160</a>

    <p>It was found that a netfilter (iptables or ip6tables) rule
    accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
    port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
    If only the generic connection tracking module (nf_conntrack) was
    loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
    this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
    protocol.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9420">CVE-2014-9420</a>

    <p>It was found that the ISO-9660 filesystem implementation (isofs)
    follows arbitrarily long chains, including loops, of Continuation
    Entries (CEs). This allows local users to mount a denial of
    service via a crafted disc image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9584">CVE-2014-9584</a>

    <p>It was found that the ISO-9660 filesystem implementation (isofs)
    does not validate a length value in the Extensions Reference (ER)
    System Use Field, which allows local users to obtain sensitive
    information from kernel memory via a crafted disc image.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9585">CVE-2014-9585</a>

    <p>It was discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO in
    64-bit processes is extremely biassed. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
    mechanism.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1421">CVE-2015-1421</a>

    <p>It was found that the SCTP implementation could free
    authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
    corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1593">CVE-2015-1593</a>

    <p>It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
    64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
    A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
    bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in linux-2.6 version 2.6.32-48squeeze11</p>
