<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The latest maintenance release of the VirtualBox (OSE) 3.2.x series
(i.e., version 3.2.28) has been uploaded to Debian LTS (squeeze). Thanks
to Gianfranco Costamagna for preparing packages for review and upload by
the Debian LTS Team.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Oracle no longer provides information on specific security
vulnerabilities in VirtualBox, thus we provide their latest 3.2.28
maintenance release in Debian LTS (squeeze) directly.</p>
