<p>Fabian Yamaguchi discovered multiple vulnerabilities in VLC, a multimedia
player and streamer:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9626">CVE-2014-9626</a>

    <p>The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
    the length of the box, leading to a possible integer underflow when
    using this length value in a call to memcpy(). This could allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary
    code execution via crafted MP4 files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9627">CVE-2014-9627</a>

    <p>The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
    that the conversion of the box length from 64bit integer to 32bit
    integer on 32bit platforms did not cause a truncation, leading to
    a possible buffer overflow. This could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code execution via
    crafted MP4 files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9628">CVE-2014-9628</a>

    <p>The MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check
    the length of the box, leading to a possible buffer overflow. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
    or arbitrary code execution via crafted MP4 files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9629">CVE-2014-9629</a>

    <p>The Dirac and Schroedinger encoders did not properly check for an
    integer overflow on 32bit platforms, leading to a possible buffer
    overflow. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (crash) or arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.3-5+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.2.0~rc2-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.0~rc2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
