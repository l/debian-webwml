<p>It was discovered that the International Components for Unicode (ICU)
library mishandles converter names starting with <code>x-</code>, which allows
remote attackers to cause a denial of service (read of uninitialized
memory) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 55.1-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 55.1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.</p>
