<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the interpreter for the Ruby
language:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4975">CVE-2014-4975</a>

	<p>The encodes() function in pack.c had an off-by-one error that could
	lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. This could allow remote
	attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code
	execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8080">CVE-2014-8080</a>, 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8090">CVE-2014-8090</a>

	<p>The REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string
	objects that could consume all available memory on the system. This
	could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.3.194-8.1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.5-1 of the ruby2.1 source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby1.9.1 packages.</p>
