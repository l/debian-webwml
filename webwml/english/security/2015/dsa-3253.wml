<p>Pound, a HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer, had several issues
related to vulnerabilities in the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.</p>

<p>For Debian 7 (wheezy) this update adds a missing part to make it actually
possible to disable client-initiated renegotiation and disables it by default
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</a>).
TLS compression is disabled (<a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4929">CVE-2012-4929</a>),
although this is normally already disabled by the OpenSSL system library.
Finally it adds the ability to disable the SSLv3 protocol (<a
href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3566">CVE-2014-3566</a>)
entirely via the new <q>DisableSSLv3</q> configuration directive, although it
will not disabled by default in this update. Additionally a non-security
sensitive issue in redirect encoding is
addressed.</p>

<p>For Debian 8 (jessie) these issues have been fixed prior to the release,
with the exception of client-initiated renegotiation (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2009-3555">CVE-2009-3555</a>).
This update addresses that issue for jessie.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.6-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6-6.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pound packages.</p>
