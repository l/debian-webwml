<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python
web development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0219">CVE-2015-0219</a>

    <p>Jedediah Smith reported that the WSGI environ in Django does not
    distinguish between headers containing dashes and headers containing
    underscores. A remote attacker could use this flaw to spoof WSGI
    headers.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0220">CVE-2015-0220</a>

    <p>Mikko Ohtamaa discovered that the django.util.http.is_safe_url()
    function in Django does not properly handle leading whitespaces in
    user-supplied redirect URLs. A remote attacker could potentially use
    this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0221">CVE-2015-0221</a>

    <p>Alex Gaynor reported a flaw in the way Django handles reading files
    in the django.views.static.serve() view. A remote attacker could
    possibly use this flaw to mount a denial of service via resource
    consumption.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.5-1+deb7u9.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.7.1-1.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.1-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
