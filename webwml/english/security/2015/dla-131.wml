<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in file, a tool/library to
determine a file type. Processing a malformed file could result in
denial of service. Most of the changes are related to parsing ELF
files.</p>

<p>As part of the fixes, several limits on aspects of the detection were
added or tightened, sometimes resulting in messages like <q>recursion
limit exceeded</q> or <q>too many program header sections</q>.</p>

<p>To mitigate such shortcomings, these limits are controllable by a new
"-R"/"--recursion" parameter in the file program. Note: A future
upgrade for file in squeeze-lts might replace this with the "-P"
parameter to keep usage consistent across all distributions.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8116">CVE-2014-8116</a>

    <p>The ELF parser (readelf.c) allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (CPU consumption or crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8117">CVE-2014-8117</a>

    <p>softmagic.c does not properly limit recursion, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash).</p>

<p>(no identifier has been assigned so far)</p>

    <p>out-of-bounds memory access</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in file version 5.04-5+squeeze9</p>
