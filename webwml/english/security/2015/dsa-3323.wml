<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the International Components
for Unicode (ICU) library.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8146">CVE-2014-8146</a>

    <p>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation does not properly
    track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow)
    or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8147">CVE-2014-8147</a>

    <p>The Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation uses an integer
    data type that is inconsistent with a header file, which allows
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect malloc
    followed by invalid free) or possibly execute arbitrary code via
    crafted text.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4760">CVE-2015-4760</a>

    <p>The Layout Engine was missing multiple boundary checks. These could
    lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption. A specially crafted
    file could cause an application using ICU to parse untrusted font
    files to crash and, possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, it was discovered that the patch applied to ICU in DSA-3187-1
for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6585">CVE-2014-6585</a> was incomplete, possibly leading to an invalid memory
access. This could allow remote attackers to disclose portion of private
memory via crafted font files.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.8.1.1-12+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-8+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 52.1-10.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 52.1-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icu packages.</p>
