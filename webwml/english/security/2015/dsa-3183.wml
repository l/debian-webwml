<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Movable Type, a
blogging system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-2184">CVE-2013-2184</a>

    <p>Unsafe use of Storable::thaw in the handling of comments to blog
    posts could allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary
    local Perl files or possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9057">CVE-2014-9057</a>

    <p>Netanel Rubin from Check Point Software Technologies discovered a
    SQL injection vulnerability in the XML-RPC interface allowing
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1592">CVE-2015-1592</a>

    <p>The Perl Storable::thaw function is not properly used, allowing
    remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local Perl files
    and possibly remotely execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.1.4+dfsg-4+deb7u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.</p>
