<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in Mailman, the mailing
list manager. Installations using a transport script (such as
postfix-to-mailman.py) to interface with their MTA instead of static
aliases were vulnerable to a path traversal attack. To successfully
exploit this, an attacker needs write access on the local file system.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.15-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:2.1.18-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.</p>
