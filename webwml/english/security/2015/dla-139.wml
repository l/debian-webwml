<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability has been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of the GNU C
library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235">CVE-2015-0235</a>

    <p>Qualys discovered that the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2
    functions were subject to a buffer overflow if provided with a
    crafted IP address argument.  This could be used by an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected
    functions.</p>

    <p>The original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>

<p>The other three CVEs fixed in Debian wheezy via DSA 3142-1 have already been
fixed in squeeze LTS via DLA DLA 97-1.</p></li>
