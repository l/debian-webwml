<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in GnuTLS, a library
implementing the TLS and SSL protocols. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0282">CVE-2015-0282</a>

    <p>GnuTLS does not verify the RSA PKCS #1 signature algorithm to match
    the signature algorithm in the certificate, leading to a potential
    downgrade to a disallowed algorithm without detecting it.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0294">CVE-2015-0294</a>

    <p>It was reported that GnuTLS does not check whether the two signature
    algorithms match on certificate import.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.12.20-8+deb7u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
