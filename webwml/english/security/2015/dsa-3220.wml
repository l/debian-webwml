<p>Hanno Boeck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the
asn1_der_decoding function in Libtasn1, a library to manage ASN.1
structures. A remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to cause
an application using the Libtasn1 library to crash, or potentially to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.13-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-3 packages.</p>
