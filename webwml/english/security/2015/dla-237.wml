    distributed version control system, is prone to a command injection
    vulnerability via a crafted repository name in a clone command.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9390">CVE-2014-9390</a>

    <p>There is a security vulnerability that affects mercurial repositories in a
    case-insensitive filesystem (eg. VFAT or HFS+).  It allows for remote
    code execution of a specially crafted repository.  This is less
    severe for the average Debian installation as they are usually set
    up with case-sensitive filesystems.</p></li>
