<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been reported that kdelibs uses the insecure mktemp() function
to create the temporary directory it uses to host user-specific sockets.
It is thus possible for another user to hijack this temporary directory
and gain socket accesses it should not have.</p>

<p>In Debian 6 “Squeeze”, this issue has been addressed in kdelibs
3.5.10.dfsg.1-5+deb6u1 with the use of the safer mkdtemp() function.
We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs packages.</p>

<p>Other Debian releases have newer versions of the libraries (kdelibs4) that
are not affected by this problem.</p>
