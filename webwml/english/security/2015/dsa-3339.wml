<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, breakouts of the Java sandbox, information disclosure,
denial of service or insecure cryptography.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6b36-1.13.8-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
