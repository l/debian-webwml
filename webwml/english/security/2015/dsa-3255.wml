<p>It was discovered that libzmq, a lightweight messaging kernel, is
susceptible to a protocol downgrade attack on sockets using the ZMTP v3
protocol. This could allow remote attackers to bypass ZMTP v3 security
mechanisms by sending ZMTP v2 or earlier headers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.5+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zeromq3 packages.</p>
