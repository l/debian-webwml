<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hanno Boeck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow flaw in the way
Libtasn1, a library to manage ASN.1 structures, decoded certain
DER-encoded input. A specially crafted DER-encoded input could cause an
application using the Libtasn1 library to crash, or potentially to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1-6 packages.</p>
