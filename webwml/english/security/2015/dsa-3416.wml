email transfer, used by many CMSs. The library accepted email addresses
and SMTP commands containing line breaks, which can be abused by an
attacker to inject messages.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1-1.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.9+dfsg-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.14+dfsg-1.</p>
