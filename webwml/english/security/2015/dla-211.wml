<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3143">CVE-2015-3143</a>

    <p>NTLM-authenticated connections could be wrongly reused for requests
    without any credentials set, leading to HTTP requests being sent
    over the connection authenticated as a different user. This is
    similar to the issue fixed in DSA-2849-1.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3148">CVE-2015-3148</a>

    <p>When doing HTTP requests using the Negotiate authentication method
    along with NTLM, the connection used would not be marked as
    authenticated, making it possible to reuse it and send requests for
    one user over the connection authenticated as a different user.</p></li>
