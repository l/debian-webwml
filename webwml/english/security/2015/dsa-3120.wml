<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in the Mantis bug tracking 
system, which may result in phishing, information disclosure, CAPTCHA 
bypass, SQL injection, cross-site scripting or the execution of arbitrary
PHP code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis packages.</p>
