<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update fixes several issues as described below.</p>

<ul>

<li>PR ld/12613 (no CVE assigned)

    <p>Niranjan Hasabnis discovered that passing an malformed linker
    script to GNU ld, part of binutils, may result in a stack buffer
    overflow.  If the linker is used with untrusted object files, this
    would allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
    or possibly privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3509">CVE-2012-3509</a>, #688951

    <p>Sang Kil Cha discovered that a buffer size calculation in
    libiberty, part of binutils, may result in integer overflow and
    then a heap buffer overflow.  If libiberty or the commands in
    binutils are used to read untrusted binaries, this would allow
    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly
    privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li>>PR binutils/18750 (no CVE assigned)

    <p>Joshua Rogers reported that passing a malformed ihex (Intel
    hexadecimal) file to to various commands in binutils may result in
    a stack buffer overflow.  A similar issue was found in readelf.
    If these commands are used to read untrusted binaries, this would
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.20.1-16+deb6u2.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and the stable distribution
(jessie), PR ld/12613 and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3509">CVE-2012-3509</a> were fixed before release, and
PR binutils/18750 will be fixed in a later update.</p>
