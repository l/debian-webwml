<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>cpnrodzc7, working with HP's Zero Day Initiative, discovered that
Java applications using standard Java serialization mechanisms to
decode untrusted data, and that have Groovy on their classpath, can
be passed a serialized object that will cause the application to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.7.0-4+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and stable distribution
(jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>
