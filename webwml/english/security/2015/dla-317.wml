<p>Various issues have been fixed in Debian LTS (squeeze) for package
vorbis-tools.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9638">CVE-2014-9638</a>

    <p>A crafted WAV file with number of channels set to 0 will cause oggenc
    to crash due to a division by zero issue. This issue has been fixed
    upstream by providing a fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9639">CVE-2014-9639</a>. Reported upstream by
    <q>zuBux</q>.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9639">CVE-2014-9639</a>

    <p>An integer overflow issue was discovered in oggenc, related to the
    number of channels in the input WAV file. The issue triggers an
    out-of-bounds memory access which causes oggenc to crash here
    (audio.c). Reported upstream by <q>zuBux</q>.</p>

    <p>The upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in
    Debian LTS (squeeze).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9640">CVE-2014-9640</a>

     <p>Fix for a crash on closing raw input (dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=1 |
     oggenc -r - -o out.ogg). Reported upstream by <q>hanno</q>.</p>

    <p>The upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in
    Debian LTS (squeeze).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6749">CVE-2015-6749</a>

    <p>Buffer overflow in the aiff_open function in oggenc/audio.c in
    vorbis-tools 1.4.0 and earlier allowed remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (crash) via a crafted AIFF file. Reported upstream
    by <q>pengsu</q>.</p>

    <p>The upstream fix for this has been backported to vorbis-tools in
    Debian LTS (squeeze).</p></li>
