<p>A vulnerability was found in WMM Action frame processing in a case where
hostapd is used to implement AP mode MLME/SME functionality (i.e., Host AP
driver of a mac80211-based driver on Linux).</p>

<p>This vulnerability can be used to perform denial of service attacks by
an attacker that is within radio range of the AP that uses hostapd for
MLME/SME operations.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 “Squeeze”, this vulnerability has been fixed in version
1:0.6.10-2+squeeze2 of hostapd. We recommend that you upgrade your
hostapd package.</p>
