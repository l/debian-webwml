<p>and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6153">CVE-2012-6153</a>
   Apache Commons HttpClient 3.1 did not verify that the server hostname
   matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName
   field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
   spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.
   Thanks to Alberto Fernandez Martinez for the patch.</p></li>

   <p>It was found that the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6153">CVE-2012-6153</a> was incomplete: the code added
   to check that the server hostname matches the domain name in a subject's
   Common Name (CN) field in X.509 certificates was flawed. A man-in-the-middle
   attacker could use this flaw to spoof an SSL server using  a specially
   crafted X.509 certificate. The fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6153">CVE-2012-6153</a> was intended to address
   the incomplete patch for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5783">CVE-2012-5783</a>. The issue is now completely resolved
   by applying this patch and the one for the previous CVEs</p></li>
