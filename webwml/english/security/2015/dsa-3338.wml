<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Lin Hua Cheng discovered that a session could be created when anonymously
accessing the django.contrib.auth.views.logout view. This could allow
remote attackers to saturate the session store or cause other users'
session records to be evicted.</p>

<p>Additionally the contrib.sessions.backends.base.SessionBase.flush() and
cache_db.SessionStore.flush() methods have been modified to avoid
creating a new empty session as well.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.4.5-1+deb7u13.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.7-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed
shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your python-django packages.</p>
