<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that redis, a persistent key-value database, could
execute insecure Lua bytecode by way of the EVAL command. This could
allow remote attackers to break out of the Lua sandbox and execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed
in version 2:3.0.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.0.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.</p>
