<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Upstream published version 0.98.5.  This update updates sqeeze-lts to the
latest upstream release in line with the approach used for other Debian
releases.</p>

<p>This update corrects a double-free error that existed within the
"unrar_extract_next_prepare()" function (libclamunrar_iface/unrar_iface.c)
when parsing a RAR file.  While no CVE was assigned, this issue does have
potential security implications.</p>

<p>If you use libclamunrar, we strongly recommend that you upgrade to this
version.</p>
