<p>A vulnerability has been found in the Internet Domain Name Server bind9:</p>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4620">CVE-2015-4620</a>

    <p>Breno Silveira Soares of Servico Federal de Processamento de Dados (SERPRO)
    discovered that the BIND DNS server is prone to a denial of service
    vulnerability. A remote attacker who can cause a validating resolver
    to query a zone containing specifically constructed contents can
    cause the resolver to terminate with an assertion failure, resulting
    in a denial of service to clients relying on the resolver.</p>

<p>For the squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version
9.7.3.dfsg-1~squeeze15 of bind9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p></li>
