<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of
the Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,
buffer overflows and use-after-frees may lead to the execution of
arbitrary code, privilege escalation or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 31.7.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.7.0-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icedove packages.</p>
