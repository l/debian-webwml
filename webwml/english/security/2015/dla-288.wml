<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>In Debian LTS (squeeze), the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5600">CVE-2015-5600</a> in openssh
1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7 breaks authentication mechanisms that rely on the
keyboard-interactive method. Thanks to Colin Watson for making aware of
that.</p>

<p>The patch fixing <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5600">CVE-2015-5600</a> introduces the field <q>devices_done</q> to the
KbdintAuthctxt struct, but does not initialize the field in the
kbdint_alloc() function. On Linux, this ends up filling that field with
junk data. The result of this are random login failures when
keyboard-interactive authentication is used.</p>

<p>This upload of openssh 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7 to Debian LTS (squeeze) adds
that initialization of the `devices_done` field alongside the existing
initialization code.</p>

<p>People relying on keyboard-interactive based authentication mechanisms with
OpenSSH on Debian squeeze(-lts) systems are recommended to upgrade
OpenSSH to 1:5.5p1-6+squeeze7.</p>
