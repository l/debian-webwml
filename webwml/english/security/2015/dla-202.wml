<p>Ignacio R. Morelle discovered that missing path restrictions in the
<q>Battle of Wesnoth</q> game could result in the disclosure of arbitrary
files in the user's home directory if malicious campaigns/maps are
loaded.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (distribution), this problem has been
fixed in version 1:1.8.5-1+deb6u1.  See DSA-3218-1 for the versions of
the other releases.</p>
