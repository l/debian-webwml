<p>C. Michael Pilato, from CollabNet, reported an issue in the version
control system Subversion.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3187">CVE-2015-3187</a>

    <p>Subversion servers revealed some sensible paths hidden by path-based
    authorization. Remote authenticated users were allowed to obtain
    path information by reading the history of a node that has been
    moved from a hidden path. The vulnerability only revealed the path,
    though it didn't reveal its content.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 “Squeeze”, this issue has been fixed in subversion
1.6.12dfsg-7+deb6u3. We recommend to upgrade your subversion packages.</p></li>
