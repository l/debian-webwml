<p>Vadim Melihow discovered that in proftpd-dfsg, an FTP server, the
mod_copy module allowed unauthenticated users to copy files around on
the server, and possibly to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.3.4a-5+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.5-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd-dfsg packages.</p>
