<p>A denial of service vulnerability was found in the Shibboleth (an
federated identity framework) Service Provider. When processing certain
malformed SAML message generated by an authenticated attacker, the daemon
could crash.</p>

<p>For the Debian 6 “Squeeze” distribution, this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.1+dfsg-5+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your shibboleth-sp2 packages.</p>
