<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alexander Cherepanov discovered that p7zip is susceptible to a
directory traversal vulnerability.  While extracting an archive, it
will extract symlinks and then follow them if they are referenced in
further entries.  This can be exploited by a rogue archive to write
files outside the current directory.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 9.04~dfsg.1-1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy) and stable distribution
(jessie), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>
