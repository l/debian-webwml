<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Researchers at INRIA and Xamarin discovered several vulnerabilities in
mono, a platform for running and developing applications based on the
ECMA/ISO Standards. Mono's TLS stack contained several problems that
hampered its capabilities: those issues could lead to client
impersonation (via SKIP-TLS), SSLv2 fallback, and encryption weakening
(via FREAK).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.8.1-8+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.8+dfsg-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mono packages.</p>
