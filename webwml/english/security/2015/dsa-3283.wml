<p>It was discovered that CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing System, is
vulnerable to a remotely triggerable privilege escalation via cross-site
scripting and bad print job submission used to replace cupsd.conf on the
CUPS server.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.5.3-5+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.5-11+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.5-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
