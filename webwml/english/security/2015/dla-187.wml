<p>Several hidden service related denial-of-service issues have been
discovered in Tor, a connection-based low-latency anonymous
communication system.</p>

<p>o <q>disgleirio</q> discovered that a malicious client could trigger an
  assertion failure in a Tor instance providing a hidden service, thus
  rendering the service inaccessible.

<p>o <q>DonnchaC</q> discovered that Tor clients would crash with an assertion
  failure upon parsing specially crafted hidden service descriptors.

<p>o Introduction points would accept multiple INTRODUCE1 cells on one
  circuit, making it inexpensive for an attacker to overload a hidden
  service with introductions.  Introduction points no longer allow
  multiple such cells on the same circuit.</p>
