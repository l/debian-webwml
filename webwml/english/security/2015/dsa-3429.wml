<p>Michal Kowalczyk and Adam Chester discovered that missing input
sanitising in the foomatic-rip print filter might result in the
execution of arbitrary commands.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.17-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.17-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.17-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your foomatic-filters packages.</p>
