<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michal Zalewski and Hanno Boeck discovered several vulnerabilities in
unrtf, a RTF to other formats converter, leading to a denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.21.5-3~deb7u1. This update is based on a new upstream version
of unrtf including additional bug fixes, new features and incompatible
changes (especially PostScript support is dropped).</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in version 0.21.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unrtf packages.</p>
