<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Oracle stopped supporting version 3.2 of VirtualBox last June. They also
do not disclose enough information about vulnerabilities discovered
and fixed in newer versions so that it is impossible for us to
verify whether the vulnerability also applies to 3.2 and to backport
the fix when needed.</p>

<p>We are thus no longer supporting virtualbox-ose in Debian 6 Squeeze.
If you rely on it, you should either consider using backports of newer
versions (version 4.1.42 is available in squeeze-backports) or
upgrade to Debian 7 Wheezy (or newer).</p>
