<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An off-by-one flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8157">CVE-2014-8157</a>), and an unrestricted stack memory use flaw
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8158">CVE-2014-8158</a>) were found in JasPer, a library for manipulating
JPEG-2000 files. A specially crafted file could cause an application
using JasPer to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.900.1-13+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jasper packages.</p>
