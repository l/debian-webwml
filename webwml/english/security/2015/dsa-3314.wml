<p>Upstream security support for Typo3 4.5.x ended three months ago and the
same now applies to the Debian packages as well.</p>

<p>Newer versions of Typo3 are no longer packaged in Debian, so the
recommended alternative is to migrate to a custom installation of Typo3
6.2.x (the current long term branch).</p>

<p>If you cannot migrate for some reason, commercial support for 4.5 is
still available. Please see

for additional information.</p>
