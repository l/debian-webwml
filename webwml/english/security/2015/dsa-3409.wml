<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A memory-corrupting integer overflow in the handling of the ECH (erase
characters) control sequence was discovered in PuTTY's terminal
emulator. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to mount a
denial of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.62-9+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.63-10+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.66-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.66-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your putty packages.</p>
