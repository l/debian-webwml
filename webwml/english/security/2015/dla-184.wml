<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in binutils, a toolbox for
binary file manipulation. These vulnerabilities include multiple memory
safety errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
restrictions, path traversal attack or denial of service.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in binutils version 2.20.1-16+deb6u1</p>
