<p>Matthew Daley discovered that squid, a web proxy cache, does not
properly perform input validation when parsing requests. A remote
attacker could use this flaw to mount a denial of service attack, by
sending specially crafted Range requests.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.STABLE9-4.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid packages.</p>
