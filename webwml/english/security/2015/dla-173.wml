    <p>Florent Daigniere discovered that PuTTY did not enforce an
    acceptable range for the Diffie-Hellman server value, as required by
    RFC 4253, potentially allowing an eavesdroppable connection to be
    established in the event of a server weakness.</p>

<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2157">CVE-2015-2157</a></p>

    <p>Patrick Coleman discovered that PuTTY did not clear SSH-2 private
    key information from memory when loading and saving key files, which
    could result in disclosure of private key material.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in putty version 0.60+2010-02-20-1+squeeze3</p>
