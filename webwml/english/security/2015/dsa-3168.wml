<p>Kousuke Ebihara discovered that redcloth, a Ruby module used to
convert Textile markup to HTML, did not properly sanitize its
input. This allowed a remote attacker to perform a cross-site
scripting attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the
generated HTML.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-2+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.9-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-redcloth packages.</p>
