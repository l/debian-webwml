<p>Sergey Gorbaty reported issues related to the FreeType font engine.
FreeType improperly handled certain malformed font files, allowing
remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service when specially crafted
font files were used.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in freetype version
2.4.2-2.1+squeeze6. We recommend you to upgrade your freetype packages.</p>
