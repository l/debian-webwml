<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that missing input sanitizing in Snoopy, a PHP class that
simulates a web browser may result in the execution of arbitrary
commands.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze-lts), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.0-1~deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-snoopy packages.</p>
