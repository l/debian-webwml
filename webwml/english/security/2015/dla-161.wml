<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that libgtk2-perl, a Perl interface to the 2.x series
of the Gimp Toolkit library, incorrectly frees memory which GTK+ still
holds onto and might access later, leading to denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in libgtk2-perl version 2:1.222-1+deb6u1</p>
