<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3569">CVE-2014-3569</a>

    <p>Frank Schmirler reported that the ssl23_get_client_hello function in
    OpenSSL does not properly handle attempts to use unsupported
    protocols. When OpenSSL is built with the no-ssl3 option and a SSL
    v3 ClientHello is received, the ssl method would be set to NULL which
    could later result in a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3570">CVE-2014-3570</a>

    <p>Pieter Wuille of Blockstream reported that the bignum squaring
    (BN_sqr) may produce incorrect results on some platforms, which
    might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic
    protection mechanisms.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3571">CVE-2014-3571</a>

    <p>Markus Stenberg of Cisco Systems, Inc. reported that a carefully
    crafted DTLS message can cause a segmentation fault in OpenSSL due
    to a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker could use this flaw
    to mount a denial of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3572">CVE-2014-3572</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
    OpenSSL client would accept a handshake using an ephemeral ECDH
    ciphersuite if the server key exchange message is omitted. This
    allows remote SSL servers to conduct ECDHE-to-ECDH downgrade attacks
    and trigger a loss of forward secrecy.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8275">CVE-2014-8275</a>

    <p>Antti Karjalainen and Tuomo Untinen of the Codenomicon CROSS project
    and Konrad Kraszewski of Google reported various certificate
    fingerprint issues, which allow remote attackers to defeat a
    fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0204">CVE-2015-0204</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that
    an OpenSSL client will accept the use of an ephemeral RSA key in a
    non-export RSA key exchange ciphersuite, violating the TLS
    standard. This allows remote SSL servers to downgrade the security
    of the session.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0205">CVE-2015-0205</a>

    <p>Karthikeyan Bhargavan of the PROSECCO team at INRIA reported that an
    OpenSSL server will accept a DH certificate for client
    authentication without the certificate verify message. This flaw
    effectively allows a client to authenticate without the use of a
    private key via crafted TLS handshake protocol traffic to a server
    that recognizes a certification authority with DH support.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0206">CVE-2015-0206</a>

    <p>Chris Mueller discovered a memory leak in the dtls1_buffer_record
    function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to mount a
    denial of service through memory exhaustion by repeatedly sending
    specially crafted DTLS records.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u14.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
