<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that PuTTY's terminal emulator did not properly
validate the parameter to the ECH (erase characters) control sequence,
allowing a denial of service and possibly remote code execution.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.60+2010-02-20-1+squeeze4.</p>

<p>For the oldstable (wheezy) and stable (jessie) distributions, this
problem will be fixed soon.</p>
