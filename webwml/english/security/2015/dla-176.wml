<p>Three issues with Mono's TLS stack are addressed.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2318">CVE-2015-2318</a>

    <p>Mono's implementation of the SSL/TLS stack failed to check
    the order of the handshake messages. Which would allow
    various attacks on the protocol to succeed. ("SKIP-TLS")</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2319">CVE-2015-2319</a>

    <p>Mono's implementation of SSL/TLS also contained support for
    the weak EXPORT cyphers and was susceptible to the FREAK attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2320">CVE-2015-2320</a>

    <p>Mono contained SSLv2 fallback code, which is no longer needed
    and can be considered insecure.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in mono version 2.6.7-5.1+deb6u1</p>
