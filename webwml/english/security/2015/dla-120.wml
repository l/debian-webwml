<p>Andreas Cord-Landwehr reported an issue where the X.Org Xserver would
often crash with an arithmetic exception when maximizing application
windows.</p>

<p>This issue (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3418">CVE-2015-3418</a>) is a regression which got introduced by fixing
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8092">CVE-2014-8092</a>. The above referenced version of xorg-server in Debian
squeeze-lts fixes this regression in the following way:</p>

<p>The length checking code validates PutImage height and byte width by
making sure that byte-width >= INT32_MAX / height. If height is zero,
this generates a divide by zero exception. Allow zero height requests
explicitly, bypassing the INT32_MAX check (in dix/dispatch.c).</p>
