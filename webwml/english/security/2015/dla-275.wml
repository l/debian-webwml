<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the uri package in the Ruby standard library
uses regular expressions that may result in excessive backtracking.
Ruby applications that parse untrusted URIs using this library were
susceptible to denial-of-service attacks by passing crafted URIs.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.9.2.0-2+deb6u6.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) and stable distribution (jessie)
were not affected by this problem as it was fixed before release.</p>
