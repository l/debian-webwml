<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, information disclosure or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 6b34-1.13.6-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
