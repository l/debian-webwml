<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ntp, an implementation of the
Network Time Protocol:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1798">CVE-2015-1798</a>

    <p>When configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would
    accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could
    allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send
    malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1799">CVE-2015-1799</a>

    <p>When peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric
    association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before
    the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization
    between NTP peers.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen
on big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate
non-random keys.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-2+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ntp packages.</p>
