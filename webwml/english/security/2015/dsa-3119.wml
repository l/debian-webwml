<p>Andrew Bartlett of Catalyst reported a defect affecting certain
applications using the Libevent evbuffer API. This defect leaves
applications which pass insanely large inputs to evbuffers open to a
possible heap overflow or infinite loop. In order to exploit this flaw,
an attacker needs to be able to find a way to provoke the program into
trying to make a buffer chunk larger than what will fit into a single
size_t or off_t.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.19-stable-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libevent packages.</p>
