<p>A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in Mailman, the mailing
list manager. Installations using a transport script (such as
postfix-to-mailman.py) to interface with their MTA instead of static
aliases were vulnerable to a path traversal attack. To successfully
exploit this, an attacker needs write access on the local file system.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in mailman version 1:2.1.13-6</p>
