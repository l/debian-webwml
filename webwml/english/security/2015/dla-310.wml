<p>This update fixes the CVEs described below.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0272">CVE-2015-0272</a>

    <p>It was discovered that NetworkManager would set IPv6 MTUs based on
    the values received in IPv6 RAs (Router Advertisements), without
    sufficiently validating these values.  A remote attacker could
    exploit this attack to disable IPv6 connectivity.  This has been
    mitigated by adding validation in the kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5156">CVE-2015-5156</a>

    <p>Jason Wang discovered that when a virtio_net device is connected
    to a bridge in the same VM, a series of TCP packets forwarded
    through the bridge may cause a heap buffer overflow.  A remote
    attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (crash) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364">CVE-2015-5364</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366">CVE-2015-5366</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5697">CVE-2015-5697</a>

    <p>A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5707">CVE-2015-5707</a>

    <p>An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937">CVE-2015-6937</a>

    <p>It was found that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol
    implementation did not verify that an underlying transport exists
    when creating a connection.  Depending on how a local RDS
    application initialised its sockets, a remote attacker might be
    able to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted
    packet.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze14.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been
fixed in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u4 or earlier.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u4 or earlier.</p>
