<p>Nicolas Gregoire and Kevin Schaller discovered that Batik, a toolkit
for processing SVG images, would load XML external entities by
default. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a
specially crafted SVG file, an attacker could possibly obtain access
to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in batik version 1.7-6+deb6u1</p>
