<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4497">CVE-2015-4497</a>

    <p>Jean-Max Reymond and Ucha Gobejishvili discovered a use-after-free
    vulnerability which occurs when resizing of a canvas element is
    triggered in concert with style changes. A web page containing
    malicious content can cause Iceweasel to crash, or potentially,
    execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running
    Iceweasel.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4498">CVE-2015-4498</a>

    <p>Bas Venis reported a flaw in the handling of add-ons installation. A
    remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to bypass the add-on
    installation prompt and trick a user into installing an add-on from
    a malicious source.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.2.1esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.1esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.1esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
