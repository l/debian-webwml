<p>Several SQL injection vulnerabilities have been discovered in Cacti, an
RRDTool frontend written in PHP. Specially crafted input can be used by
an attacker in the rra_id value of the graph.php script to execute
arbitrary SQL commands on the database.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.8.8a+dfsg-5+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8b+dfsg-8+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.8.8f+ds1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.8f+ds1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cacti packages.</p>
