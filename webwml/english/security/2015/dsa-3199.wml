<p>Anton Rager and Jonathan Brossard from the Salesforce.com Product
Security Team and Ben Laurie of Google discovered a denial of service
vulnerability in xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for C++. The
parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting
in a segmentation fault during a parse operation. An unauthenticated
attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using the
xerces-c library to crash.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.1-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xerces-c packages.</p>
