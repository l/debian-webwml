<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Drupal, a content management
framework:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6658">CVE-2015-6658</a>

    <p>The form autocomplete functionality did not properly sanitize the
    requested URL, allowing remote attackers to perform a cross-site
    scripting attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6659">CVE-2015-6659</a>

    <p>The SQL comment filtering system could allow a user with elevated
    permissions to inject malicious code in SQL comments.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6660">CVE-2015-6660</a>

    <p>The form API did not perform form token validation early enough,
    allowing the file upload callbacks to be run with untrusted input.
    This could allow remote attackers to upload files to the site under
    another user's account.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6661">CVE-2015-6661</a>

    <p>Users without the <q>access content</q> permission could see the titles
    of nodes that they do not have access to, if the nodes were added to
    a menu on the site that the users have access to.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6665">CVE-2015-6665</a>

    <p>Remote attackers could perform a cross-site scripting attack by
    invoking Drupal.ajax() on a whitelisted HTML element.</p></li>
