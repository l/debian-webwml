<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591">CVE-2014-3591</a>

    <p>The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a quite
    noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837">CVE-2015-0837</a>

    <p>The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1606">CVE-2015-1606</a>

    <p>The keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet types
    not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory already
    freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) via crafted keyring files.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), those problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.10-4+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.12-7+deb7u7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
