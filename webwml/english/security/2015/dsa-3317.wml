<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in LXC, the Linux
Containers userspace tools. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1331">CVE-2015-1331</a>

    <p>Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC when
    creating lock files. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to
    create an arbitrary file as the root user.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1334">CVE-2015-1334</a>

    <p>Roman Fiedler discovered that LXC incorrectly trusted the
    container's proc filesystem to set up AppArmor profile changes and
    SELinux domain transitions. A malicious container could create a
    fake proc filesystem and use this flaw to run programs inside the
    container that are not confined by AppArmor or SELinux.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.0.7-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:1.0.7-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.</p>
