<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an
extensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities
and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9472">CVE-2014-9472</a>

    <p>Christian Loos discovered a remote denial of service vulnerability,
    exploitable via the email gateway and affecting any installation
    which accepts mail from untrusted sources. Depending on RT's
    logging configuration, a remote attacker can take advantage of
    this flaw to cause CPU and excessive disk usage.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1165">CVE-2015-1165</a>

    <p>Christian Loos discovered an information disclosure flaw which may
    reveal RSS feeds URLs, and thus ticket data.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1464">CVE-2015-1464</a>

    <p>It was discovered that RSS feed URLs can be leveraged to perform
    session hijacking, allowing a user with the URL to log in as the
    user that created the feed.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.8.8-7+squeeze9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker3.8 packages.</p>
