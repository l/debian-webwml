<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5278">CVE-2015-5278</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
    the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5279">CVE-2015-5279</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw
    in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6815">CVE-2015-6815</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in
    the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw
    to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6855">CVE-2015-6855</a>

    <p>Qinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE
    subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's
    WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a
    drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a
    denial of service (QEMU process crash).</p></li>
