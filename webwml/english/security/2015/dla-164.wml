<p>Jakub Wilk discovered that unace, an utility to extract, test and view
.ace archives, contained an integer overflow leading to a buffer
overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted ace archive, an attacker could cause a denial of
service (application crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in unace version 1.2b-7+deb6u1</p>
