<p>Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered a buffer overflow
vulnerability in the XML parser functionality of miniupnpc, a UPnP IGD
client lightweight library. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
flaw to cause an application using the miniupnpc library to crash, or
potentially to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running the application.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.5-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.20140610-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your miniupnpc packages.</p>
