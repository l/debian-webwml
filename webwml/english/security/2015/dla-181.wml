<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Anton Rager and Jonathan Brossard from the Salesforce.com Product
Security Team and Ben Laurie of Google discovered a denial of service
vulnerability in xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for C++. The
parser mishandles certain kinds of malformed input documents, resulting
in a segmentation fault during a parse operation. An unauthenticated
attacker could use this flaw to cause an application using the
xerces-c library to crash.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in xerces-c version 3.1.1-1+deb6u1</p>
