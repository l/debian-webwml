<p>Dawid Golunski discovered that when running under PHP-FPM in a threaded
environment, Zend Framework, a PHP framework, did not properly handle XML data
in multibyte encoding. This could be used by remote attackers to perform an XML
External Entity attack via crafted XML data.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 “Squeeze”, this issue has been fixed in zendframework
version 1.10.6-1squeeze5.</p>
