<p>Jakub Wilk discovered that in requests, an HTTP library for the Python
language, authentication information was improperly handled when a
redirect occured. This would allow remote servers to obtain two
different types of sensitive information: proxy passwords from the
Proxy-Authorization header 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1830">\
CVE-2014-1830</a>), or netrc passwords from the Authorization header 
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-1829">\
CVE-2014-1829</a>).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.1-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.3.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your requests packages.</p>
