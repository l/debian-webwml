<p>Trevin Beattie [1] <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1259892">discovered</a> an issue where one could observe hanging
threads in a multi-threaded Java application. After debugging the issue,
it became evident that the hanging threads were caused by the SSL
initialization code in commons-httpclient.</p>

<p>This upload fixes this issue by respecting the configured SO_TIMEOUT
during SSL handshakes with the server.</p>
