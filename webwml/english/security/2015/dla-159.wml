<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter De Wachter discovered that CUPS, the Common UNIX Printing
System, did not correctly parse compressed raster files. By submitting
a specially crafted raster file, a remote attacker could use this
vulnerability to trigger a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.4-7+squeeze7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3-5+deb7u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups packages.</p>
