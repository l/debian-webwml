<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network
Security Service library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7181">CVE-2015-7181</a>

    <p>The sec_asn1d_parse_leaf function improperly restricts access to an
    unspecified data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a
    denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
    code via crafted OCTET STRING data, related to a "use-after-poison"
    issue.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7182">CVE-2015-7182</a>

     <p>A Heap-based buffer overflow in the ASN.1 decoder allows remote
     attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or
     possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted OCTET STRING data.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.12.8-1+squeeze13.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nss packages.</p>
