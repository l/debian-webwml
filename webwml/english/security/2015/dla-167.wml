<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kousuke Ebihara discovered that redcloth, a Ruby module used to
convert Textile markup to HTML, did not properly sanitize its
input. This allowed a remote attacker to perform a cross-site
scripting attack by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code into the
generated HTML.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in redcloth version 4.2.2-1.1+deb6u1</p>
