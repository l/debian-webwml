<p>James Clawson discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, would follow symlinks in a repository when presenting a
file for download. An attacker with repository write access could
thereby access any file on disk readable by the user the webserver
runs as.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.3-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your websvn packages.</p>
