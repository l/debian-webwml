<p>Bastian Blank from credativ discovered that cinder, a
storage-as-a-service system for the OpenStack cloud computing suite,
contained a bug that would allow an authenticated user to read any
file from the cinder server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2014.1.3-11+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2015.1.0+2015.06.16.git26.9634b76ba5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cinder packages.</p>
