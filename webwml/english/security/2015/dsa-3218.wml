<p>Ignacio R. Morelle discovered that missing path restrictions in the
<q>Battle of Wesnoth</q> game could result in the disclosure of arbitrary
files in the user's home directory if malicious campaigns/maps are
loaded.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.3-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.10.7-2 and in version 1:1.12.1-1 of the wesnoth-1.12
source package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wesnoth-1.10 packages.</p>
