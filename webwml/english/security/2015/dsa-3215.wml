<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a graphics library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2497">CVE-2014-2497</a>

    <p>The gdImageCreateFromXpm() function would try to dereference a NULL
    pointer when reading an XPM file with a special color table. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
    crafted XPM files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9709">CVE-2014-9709</a>

    <p>Importing an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function
    would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.36~rc1~dfsg-6.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.1.0-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.0-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgd2 packages.</p>
