<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgd2, a graphics library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-2497">CVE-2014-2497</a>

    <p>The gdImageCreateFromXpm() function would try to dereference a NULL
    pointer when reading an XPM file with a special color table. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via
    crafted XPM files.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9709">CVE-2014-9709</a>

    <p>Importing an invalid GIF file using the gdImageCreateFromGif() function
    would cause a read buffer overflow that could allow remote attackers to
    cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted GIF files.</p></li>
