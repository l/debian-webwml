<p>Several denial-of-service issues have been discovered in Tor, a
connection-based low-latency anonymous communication system.</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Jowr discovered that very high DNS query load on a relay could
    trigger an assertion error.</p></li>

  <li><p>A relay could crash with an assertion error if a buffer of exactly
    the wrong layout was passed to buf_pullup() at exactly the wrong
    time.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.2.4.26-1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (jessie) and unstable distribution (sid),
these problems have been fixed in version 0.2.5.11-1.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this update disables support for SSLv3 in Tor. All
versions of OpenSSL in use with Tor today support TLS 1.0 or later.</p>

<p>Additionally, this release updates the geoIP database used by Tor as
well as the list of directory authority servers, which Tor clients use
to bootstrap and who sign the Tor directory consensus document.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
