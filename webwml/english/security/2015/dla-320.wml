<p>Pali Roh√°r discovered [1] a possible DoS attack in any software which uses
the Email::Address Perl module for parsing string input to a list of
email addresses.</p>

<p>By default Email::Address module, version v1.907 (and all before) tries to
understand nestable comments in an input string with depth level 2.</p>

<p>With specially crafted inputs, parsing nestable comments can become too
slow and  can cause high CPU load, freeze the application and end in
Denial of Service.</p>

<p>Because input strings for Email::Address module come from external
sources (e.g. from email sent by an attacker) it is a security problem
impacting on all software applications which parse email messages using
the Email::Address Perl module.</p>

<p>With this upload of libemail-address-perl, the default value of nestable
comments has been set to depth level 1 (as proposed by upstream). Please
note that this is not proper a fix, just a workaround for pathological
inputs with nestable comments.</p>
