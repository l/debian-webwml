<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Hanno Boeck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the dpkg-deb
component of dpkg, the Debian package management system. This flaw could
potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if a user or an automated
system were tricked into processing a specially crafted Debian binary
package (.deb) in the old style Debian binary package format.</p>

<p>This update also includes updated translations and additional bug fixes.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.16.17.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17.26.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your dpkg packages.</p>
