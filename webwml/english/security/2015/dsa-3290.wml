<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, information leaks
or data corruption.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a>

    <p>Red Hat discovered that the pipe iovec read and write
    implementations may iterate over the iovec twice but will modify the
    iovec such that the second iteration accesses the wrong memory. A
    local user could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly for
    privilege escalation. This may also result in data corruption and
    information leaks in pipes between non-malicious processes.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3636">CVE-2015-3636</a>

    <p>Wen Xu and wushi of KeenTeam discovered that users allowed to create
    ping sockets can use them to crash the system and, on 32-bit
    architectures, for privilege escalation. However, by default, no
    users on a Debian system have access to ping sockets.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a>

    <p>Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing
    a necessary length checks. A local user that can mount devices could
    use this flaw to crash the system.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems were fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1 or earlier, except for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a> which will
be fixed later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
