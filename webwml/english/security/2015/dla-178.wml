<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several issues have been discovered and fixed in Tor, a connection-based
low-latency anonymous communication system.</p>

  <p>o Jowr discovered that very high DNS query load on a relay could
    trigger an assertion error.</p>

  <p>o A relay could crash with an assertion error if a buffer of exactly
    the wrong layout was passed to buf_pullup() at exactly the wrong
    time.</p>

  <p>o When sending the address of the chosen rendezvous point to a hidden
    service clients were leaking to the hidden service they were on a
    little-endian or big-endian systems.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this update disables support for SSLv3 in Tor. All
versions of OpenSSL in use with Tor today support TLS 1.0 or later.</p>

<p>Additionally, this release updates the geoIP database used by Tor as
well as the list of directory authority servers, which Tor clients use
to bootstrap and trust to sign the Tor directory consensus document.</p>
