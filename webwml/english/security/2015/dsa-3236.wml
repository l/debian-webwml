<p>It was discovered that missing input sanitising in Libreoffice's filter
for HWP documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code if a
malformed document is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>
