<p>Pierrick Caillon discovered that the authentication could be bypassed in
the Typo 3 content management system. Please refer to the upstream
advisory for additional information:
<url "https://typo3.org/teams/security/security-bulletins/typo3-core/typo3-core-sa-2015-001/" /></p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.19+dfsg1-5+wheezy4.</p>

<p>The upcoming stable distribution (jessie) no longer includes Typo 3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.40+dfsg1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typo3-src packages.</p>
