<p>A vulnerability was discovered in the qemu virtualisation solution:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3456">CVE-2015-3456</a>

    <p>Jason Geffner discovered a buffer overflow in the emulated floppy
    disk drive, resulting in the potential execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Despite the end-of-life of qemu support in the old-oldstable
distribution (squeeze-lts), this problem has been fixed in version
0.12.5+dfsg-3squeeze4 of the qemu source package due to its severity
(the so-called VENOM vulnerability).</p>

<p>Further problems may still be present in the qemu package in the
old-oldstable distribution (squeeze-lts) and users who need to rely on
qemu are encouraged to upgrade to a newer version of Debian.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.</p></li>
