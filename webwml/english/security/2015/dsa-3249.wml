<p>Shadowman131 discovered that jqueryui, a JavaScript UI library for
dynamic web applications, failed to properly sanitize its <q>title</q>
option. This would allow a remote attacker to inject arbitrary code
through cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.8.ooops.21+dfsg-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), testing distribution (stretch)
and unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10.1+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your jqueryui packages.</p>
