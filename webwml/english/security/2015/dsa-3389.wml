<p>Security support for elasticsearch in jessie is hereby discontinued. The
project no longer releases information on fixed security issues which
allow backporting them to released versions of Debian and actively
discourages from doing so.</p>

<p>elasticsearch will also be removed from Debian stretch (the next stable
Debian release), but will continue to remain in unstable and available
in jessie-backports.</p>
