<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3209">CVE-2015-3209</a>

    <p>Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
    in the way QEMU's AMD PCnet Ethernet emulation handles multi-TMD
    packets with a length above 4096 bytes. A privileged guest user in a
    guest with an AMD PCNet ethernet card enabled can potentially use
    this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges
    of the hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4037">CVE-2015-4037</a>

    <p>Kurt Seifried of Red Hat Product Security discovered that QEMU's
    user mode networking stack uses predictable temporary file names
    when the -smb option is used. An unprivileged user can use this flaw
    to cause a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
