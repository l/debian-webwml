<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the PHP language:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2301">CVE-2015-2301</a>

    <p>Use-after-free in the phar extension.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2331">CVE-2015-2331</a>

    <p>Emmanuel Law discovered an integer overflow in the processing
    of ZIP archives, resulting in denial of service or potentially
    the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.4.39-0+deb7u1. This update also fixes a regression in the
curl support introduced in DSA 3195.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php5 packages.</p>
