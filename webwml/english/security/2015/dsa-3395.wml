<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2695">CVE-2015-2695</a>

    <p>It was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()
    on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API
    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a
    process crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2696">CVE-2015-2696</a>

    <p>It was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()
    on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API
    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a
    process crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2697">CVE-2015-2697</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the build_principal_va() function incorrectly
    handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a
    large realm field beginning with a null byte.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.10.1+dfsg-5+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.12.1+dfsg-19+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.13.2+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.13.2+dfsg-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
