<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in PostgreSQL, a relational
database server system.  The 8.4 branch is EOLed upstream, but still
present in Debian squeeze.  This new LTS minor version contains the
fixes that were applied upstream to the 9.0.19 version, backported to
8.4.22 which was the last version officially released by the PostgreSQL
developers.  This LTS effort for squeeze-lts is a community project
sponsored by credativ GmbH.</p>
