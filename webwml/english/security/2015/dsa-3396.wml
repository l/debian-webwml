<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5307">CVE-2015-5307</a>

    <p>Ben Serebrin from Google discovered a guest to host denial of
    service flaw affecting the KVM hypervisor. A malicious guest can
    trigger an infinite stream of <q>alignment check</q> (#AC) exceptions
    causing the processor microcode to enter an infinite loop where the
    core never receives another interrupt. This leads to a panic of the
    host kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7833">CVE-2015-7833</a>

    <p>Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke and Ralf Spenneberg discovered a
    flaw in the processing of certain USB device descriptors in the
    usbvision driver. An attacker with physical access to the system can
    use this flaw to crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7872">CVE-2015-7872</a>

    <p>Dmitry Vyukov discovered a vulnerability in the keyrings garbage
    collector allowing a local user to trigger a kernel panic.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7990">CVE-2015-7990</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the fix for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6937">CVE-2015-6937</a> was incomplete. A
    race condition when sending a message on unbound socket can still
    cause a NULL pointer dereference. A remote attacker might be able to
    cause a denial of service (crash) by sending a crafted packet.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
