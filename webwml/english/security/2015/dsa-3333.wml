<define-tag description>security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser:  Multiple memory safety errors,
integer overflows, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other
implementation errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code,
bypass of the same-origin policy or denial of service.</p>

<p>Debian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support
for the 31.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now
following the 38.x releases.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 38.2.0esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.0esr-1~deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 38.2.0esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
