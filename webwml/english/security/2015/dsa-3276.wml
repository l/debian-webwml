<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Zalas discovered that Symfony, a framework to create websites and
web applications, was vulnerable to restriction bypass. It was
affecting applications with ESI or SSI support enabled, that use the
FragmentListener. A malicious user could call any controller via the
/_fragment path by providing an invalid hash in the URL (or removing
it), bypassing URL signing and security rules.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.21+dfsg-4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.7.0~beta2+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.0~beta2+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your symfony packages.</p>
