<p>Insufficient input sanitising in libwmf, a library to process Windows
metafile data, may result in denial of service or the execution of
arbitrary code if a malformed WMF file is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.2.8.4-10.3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.8.4-10.3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libwmf packages.</p>
