<p>Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in LXC, the Linux
Containers userspace tools. A local attacker with access to a LXC
container could exploit this flaw to run programs inside the container
that are not confined by AppArmor or expose unintended files in the host
to the container.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.0.6-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lxc packages.</p>
