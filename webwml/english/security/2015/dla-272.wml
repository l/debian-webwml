<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python web
development framework:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2317">CVE-2015-2317</a>

    <p>Daniel Chatfield discovered that python-django, a high-level Python
    web development framework, incorrectly handled user-supplied redirect
    URLs. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a cross-site
    scripting attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5143">CVE-2015-5143</a>

    <p>Eric Peterson and Lin Hua Cheng discovered that a new empty record
    used to be created in the session storage every time a session was
    accessed and an unknown session key was provided in the request
    cookie. This could allow remote attackers to saturate the session
    store or cause other users' session records to be evicted.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5144">CVE-2015-5144</a>

    <p>Sjoerd Job Postmus discovered that some built-in validators did not
    properly reject newlines in input values. This could allow remote
    attackers to inject headers in emails and HTTP responses.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.3-3+squeeze13.</p>
