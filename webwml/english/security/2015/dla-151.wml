<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the update released for libxml2 in DSA 2978 fixing
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-0191">CVE-2014-0191</a> was incomplete. This caused libxml2 to still fetch external
entities regardless of whether entity substitution or validation is
enabled.</p>

<p>In addition, this update addresses a regression introduced in DSA 3057 by
the patch fixing <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3660">CVE-2014-3660</a>. This caused libxml2 to not parse an
entity when it's used first in another entity referenced from an
attribute value.</p>
