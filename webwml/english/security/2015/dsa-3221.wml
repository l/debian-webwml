<p>Adam Sampson discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the
XAUTHORITY environment variable in das-watchdog, a watchdog daemon to
ensure a realtime process won't hang the machine. A local user can
exploit this flaw to escalate his privileges and execute arbitrary
code as root.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.0-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your das-watchdog packages.</p>
