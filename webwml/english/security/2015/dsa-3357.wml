<p>It was discovered that vzctl, a set of control tools for the OpenVZ
server virtualisation solution, determined the storage layout of
containers based on the presense of an XML file inside the container.
An attacker with local root privileges in a simfs-based container
could gain control over ploop-based containers. Further information on
the prerequites of such an attack can be found at
<a href="https://src.openvz.org/projects/OVZL/repos/vzctl/commits/9e98ea630ac0e88b44e3e23c878a5166aeb74e1c">\
src.openvz.org</a>.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.8-1+deb8u2. During the update existing configurations are
automatically updated.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.9.4-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 4.9.4-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vzctl packages.</p>
