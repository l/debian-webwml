<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a denial of service, information leaks or privilege
escalation.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7421">CVE-2013-7421</a> /
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9644">CVE-2014-9644</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Crypto API allowed unprivileged users
    to load arbitrary kernel modules. A local user can use this flaw
    to exploit vulnerabilities in modules that would not normally be
    loaded.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7822">CVE-2014-7822</a>

    <p>Akira Fujita found that the splice() system call did not validate
    the given file offset and length. A local unprivileged user can use
    this flaw to cause filesystem corruption on ext4 filesystems, or
    possibly other effects.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8160">CVE-2014-8160</a>

    <p>Florian Westphal discovered that a netfilter (iptables/ip6tables) rule
    accepting packets to a specific SCTP, DCCP, GRE or UDPlite
    port/endpoint could result in incorrect connection tracking state.
    If only the generic connection tracking module (nf_conntrack) was
    loaded, and not the protocol-specific connection tracking module,
    this would allow access to any port/endpoint of the specified
    protocol.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8559">CVE-2014-8559</a>

    <p>It was found that kernel functions that iterate over a directory
    tree can dead-lock or live-lock in case some of the directory
    entries were recently deleted or dropped from the cache. A local
    unprivileged user can use this flaw for denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9585">CVE-2014-9585</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that address randomisation for the vDSO
    in 64-bit processes is extremely biased. A local unprivileged user
    could potentially use this flaw to bypass the ASLR protection
    mechanism.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9683">CVE-2014-9683</a>

    <p>Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
    the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
    in local denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0239">CVE-2015-0239</a>

    <p>It was found that KVM did not correctly emulate the x86 SYSENTER
    instruction. An unprivileged user within a guest system that has
    not enabled SYSENTER, for example because the emulated CPU vendor
    is AMD, could potentially use this flaw to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation in that guest.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1420">CVE-2015-1420</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the open_by_handle_at() system call reads
    the handle size from user memory a second time after validating
    it. A local user with the CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH capability could use
    this flaw for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1421">CVE-2015-1421</a>

    <p>It was found that the SCTP implementation could free an
    authentication state while it was still in use, resulting in heap
    corruption. This could allow remote users to cause a denial of
    service or privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1593">CVE-2015-1593</a>

    <p>It was found that address randomisation for the initial stack in
    64-bit processes was limited to 20 rather than 22 bits of entropy.
    A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to
    bypass the ASLR protection mechanism.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.2.65-1+deb7u2. Additionally this update fixes regressions
introduced in versions 3.2.65-1 and 3.2.65-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be fixed
soon (a subset is fixed already).</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon
(a subset is fixed already).</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
