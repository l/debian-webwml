<p>It was discovered that unattended-upgrades, a script for automatic
installation of security upgrades, did not properly authenticate
downloaded packages when the force-confold or force-confnew dpkg options
were enabled via the DPkg::Options::* apt configuration.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.79.5+wheezy2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.83.3.2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unattended-upgrades packages.</p>
