<p>Jonathan Foote discovered that the BIND DNS server does not properly
handle TKEY queries. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw
to mount a denial of service via a specially crafted query triggering an
assertion failure and causing BIND to exit.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.9.5.dfsg-9+deb8u2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
