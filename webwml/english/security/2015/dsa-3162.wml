<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jan-Piet Mens discovered that the BIND DNS server would crash when
processing an invalid DNSSEC key rollover, either due to an error on
the zone operator's part, or due to interference with network traffic
by an attacker.  This issue affects configurations with the directives
"dnssec-validation auto;" (as enabled in the Debian default
configuration) or "dnssec-lookaside auto;".</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:9.8.4.dfsg.P1-6+nmu2+deb7u4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bind9 packages.</p>
