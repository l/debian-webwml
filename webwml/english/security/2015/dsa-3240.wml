<p>It was discovered that cURL, an URL transfer library, if configured to
use a proxy server with the HTTPS protocol, by default could send to the
proxy the same HTTP headers it sends to the destination server, possibly
leaking sensitive information.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed in
version 7.42.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.42.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
