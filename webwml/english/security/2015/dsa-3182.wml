<p>Mariusz Ziulek reported that libssh2, a SSH2 client-side library, was
reading and using the SSH_MSG_KEXINIT packet without doing sufficient
range checks when negotiating a new SSH session with a remote server. A
malicious attacker could man in the middle a real server and cause a
client using the libssh2 library to crash (denial of service) or
otherwise read and use unintended memory areas in this process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2-1.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libssh2 packages.</p>
