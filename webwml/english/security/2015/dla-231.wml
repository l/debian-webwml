<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer overflow in
the C implementation of the apply_delta() function, used when accessing
Git objects in pack files. An attacker could take advantage of this flaw
to cause the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the user
running a Git server or client based on Dulwich.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 0.6.1-1+deb6u1.</p>
