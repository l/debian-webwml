<p>Stefan Roas discovered a way to cause a buffer overflow in DBD-FireBird,
a Perl DBI driver for the Firebird RDBMS, in certain error conditions, due
to the use of the sprintf() function to write to a fixed-size memory buffer.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.91-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.18-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.18-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdbd-firebird-perl packages.</p>
