<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in arj, an open source
version of the arj archiver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0556">CVE-2015-0556</a>

    <p>Jakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during
    unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw
    to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated
    system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0557">CVE-2015-0557</a>

    <p>Jakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from
    directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file
    paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use
    this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system
    were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2782">CVE-2015-2782</a>

    <p>Jakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow
    vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause
    an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the
    privileges of the user running arj.</p></li>
