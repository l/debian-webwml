<p>A flaw was found in PolarSSl and mbed TLS:</p>


<p>When the client creates its ClientHello message, due to insufficient bounds
checking it can overflow the heap-based buffer containing the message while
writing some extensions. Two extensions in particular could be used by a remote
attacker to trigger the overflow: the session ticket extension and the server
name indication (SNI) extension.</p>


<p>
<p>Although most of the vulnerable code is not present in the Squeeze version,
this upload contains at least a length check for incoming data.</p>
