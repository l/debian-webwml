<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alex Rousskov discovered that Squid configured with cache_peer and
operating on explicit proxy traffic does not correctly handle CONNECT
method peer responses. In some configurations, it allows remote clients to
bypass security in an explicit gateway proxy.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 Squeeze, this problem has been fixed in squid3 version
3.1.6-1.2+squeeze5. We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
