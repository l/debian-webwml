<p>Juliane Holzt discovered that Icecast2, a streaming media server, could
dereference a NULL pointer when URL authentication is configured and the
stream_auth URL is trigged by a client without setting any credentials.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.0-1.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your icecast2 packages.</p>
