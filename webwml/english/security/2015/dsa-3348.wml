<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor
emulator.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3214">CVE-2015-3214</a>

    <p>Matt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw
    in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest
    with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to
    execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the
    hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5154">CVE-2015-5154</a>

    <p>Kevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the
    IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A
    privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could
    potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with
    the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165">CVE-2015-5165</a>

    <p>Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
    card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
    emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
    from the QEMU process's heap.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5225">CVE-2015-5225</a>

    <p>Mr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc
    discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading
    to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or
    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the
    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745">CVE-2015-5745</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
    handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6a+deb7u9. The oldstable distribution is only
affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165">CVE-2015-5165</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745">CVE-2015-5745</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.1+dfsg-12+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:2.4+dfsg-1a.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu packages.</p>
