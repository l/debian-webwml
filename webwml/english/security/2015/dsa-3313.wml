<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3290">CVE-2015-3290</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly
    handle nested NMIs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw
    for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3291">CVE-2015-3291</a>

    <p>Andy Lutomirski discovered that under certain conditions a malicious
    userspace program can cause the kernel to skip NMIs leading to a
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a>

    <p>Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing
    a necessary length check. A local user that can mount devices could
    use this flaw to crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5157">CVE-2015-5157</a>

    <p>Petr Matousek and Andy Lutomirski discovered that an NMI that
    interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is incorrectly
    handled. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw for denial
    of service or possibly for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364">CVE-2015-5364</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366">CVE-2015-5366</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.8-2 or earlier versions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
