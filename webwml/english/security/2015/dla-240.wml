<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount
directives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod_jk to forward
requests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a subtree
of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a remote attacker
to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that would otherwise not be
accessible to them.</p>

<p>For the squeeze distribution, this problem has been fixed in version
1:1.2.30-1squeeze2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.</p>

<p>This update has been prepared by Markus Koschany.</p>
