<p>It was discovered that libgtk2-perl, a Perl interface to the 2.x series
of the Gimp Toolkit library, incorrectly frees memory which GTK+ still
holds onto and might access later, leading to denial of service
(application crash) or, potentially, to arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.244-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2:1.2492-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.2492-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgtk2-perl packages.</p>
