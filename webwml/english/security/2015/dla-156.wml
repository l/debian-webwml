<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Richard van Eeden of Microsoft Vulnerability Research discovered that
Samba, a SMB/CIFS file, print, and login server for Unix, contains a
flaw in the netlogon server code which allows remote code execution with
root privileges from an unauthenticated connection.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.5.6~dfsg-3squeeze12.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.6.6-6+deb7u5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba packages.</p>
