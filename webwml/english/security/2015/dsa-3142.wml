<p>Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235">CVE-2015-0235</a>

    <p>Qualys discovered that the gethostbyname and gethostbyname2
    functions were subject to a buffer overflow if provided with a
    crafted IP address argument.  This could be used by an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code in processes which called the affected
    functions.</p>

    <p>The original glibc bug was reported by Peter Klotz.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-7817">CVE-2014-7817</a>

    <p>Tim Waugh of Red Hat discovered that the WRDE_NOCMD option of the
    wordexp function did not suppress command execution in all cases.
    This allows a context-dependent attacker to execute shell
    commands.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6656">CVE-2012-6656</a>
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-6040">CVE-2014-6040</a>

    <p>The charset conversion code for certain IBM multi-byte code pages
    could perform an out-of-bounds array access, causing the process
    to crash.  In some scenarios, this allows a remote attacker to
    cause a persistent denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.13-38+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), the 
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0235">CVE-2015-0235</a> 
issue has been fixed in version 2.18-1 of the glibc package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>
