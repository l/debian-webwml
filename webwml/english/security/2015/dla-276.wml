<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Adam <adam@anope.org>, upstream author of inspircd found the Debian
patch that fixed <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1836">CVE-2012-1836</a> was incomplete. Furthermore, it
introduced an issue, since invalid dns packets caused an infinite loop.
This upload corrects these problems.</p>

<p>As of today, no CVEs has been assigned to these Debian-specific flaws.</p>

<p>For the Squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version
1.1.22+dfsg-4+squeeze2 of inspircd.</p>
