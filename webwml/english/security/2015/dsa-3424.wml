<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ivan Zhakov discovered an integer overflow in mod_dav_svn, which allows
an attacker with write access to the server to execute arbitrary code or
cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
