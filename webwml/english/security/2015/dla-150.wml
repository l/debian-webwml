<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw was found in the test_compr_eb() function allowing out-of-bounds
read and write access to memory locations. By carefully crafting a
corrupt ZIP archive an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, resulting
in application crash or possibly having other unspecified impact.</p>


<p>Additionally this update corrects a defective patch applied to address
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139">CVE-2014-8139</a>, which caused a regression with executable jar files.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in unzip version 6.0-4+deb6u2</p>
