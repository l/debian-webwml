<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>CÃ©dric Krier discovered a vulnerability in the server-side of Tryton, an
application framework written in Python. An aunthenticated malicious
user can write arbitrary values in record fields due missed checks of
access permissions when multiple records are written.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.0-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.8.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tryton-server packages.</p>
