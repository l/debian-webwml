<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Petr Sklenar of Red Hat discovered that the texttopdf tool, part of cups
filters, was susceptible to multiple heap-based buffer and integer overflows
due to improper handling of print jobs. This could allow remote attackers to
crash texttopdf or possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, this issue has been fixed in cups version
1.4.4-7+squeeze10. For Wheezy and Jessie, this has been fixed in the
cups-filter package. We recommend you to upgrade your cups packages.</p>
