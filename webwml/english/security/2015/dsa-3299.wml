<p>Johan Olofsson discovered an authentication bypass vulnerability in
Stunnel, a program designed to work as an universal SSL tunnel for
network daemons. When Stunnel in server mode is used with the redirect
option and certificate-based authentication is enabled with <q>verify = 2</q>
or higher, then only the initial connection is redirected to the hosts
specified with <q>redirect</q>. This allows a remote attacker to bypass
authentication.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:5.06-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3:5.18-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:5.18-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your stunnel4 packages.</p>
