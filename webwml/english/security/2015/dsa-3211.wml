<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version
of the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors,
use-after-frees and other implementation errors may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security restrictions, denial
of service or cross-site request forgery.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.6.0esr-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 31.6.0esr-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your iceweasel packages.</p>
