<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tomek Rabczak from the NCC Group discovered a flaw in the
normalize_params() method in Rack, a modular Ruby webserver interface.
A remote attacker can use this flaw via specially crafted requests to
cause a `SystemStackError` and potentially cause a denial of service
condition for the service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.4.1-2.1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.2-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-rack packages.</p>
