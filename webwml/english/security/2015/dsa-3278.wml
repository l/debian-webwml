<p>An information disclosure flaw due to incorrect JkMount/JkUnmount
directives processing was found in the Apache 2 module mod_jk to forward
requests from the Apache web server to Tomcat. A JkUnmount rule for a
subtree of a previous JkMount rule could be ignored. This could allow a
remote attacker to potentially access a private artifact in a tree that
would otherwise not be accessible to them.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.37-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.37-4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:1.2.40+svn150520-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache-mod-jk packages.</p>
