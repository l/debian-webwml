<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel
that may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or
information leak.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1333">CVE-2015-1333</a>

    <p>Colin Ian King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the
    Linux kernel's keyring subsystem. A local user can exploit this flaw
    to cause a denial of service due to memory exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3212">CVE-2015-3212</a>

    <p>Ji Jianwen of Red Hat Engineering discovered a flaw in the handling
    of the SCTPs automatic handling of dynamic multi-homed connections.
    A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a crash or potentially
    for privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4692">CVE-2015-4692</a>

    <p>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the
    kvm_apic_has_events function in the KVM subsystem. A unprivileged
    local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system kernel
    resulting in denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4700">CVE-2015-4700</a>

    <p>Daniel Borkmann discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel implementation
    of the Berkeley Packet Filter which can be used by a local user to
    crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364">CVE-2015-5364</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to
    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid
    checksums.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366">CVE-2015-5366</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle
    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of
    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single
    packet with an invalid checksum.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5697">CVE-2015-5697</a>

    <p>A flaw was discovered in the md driver in the Linux kernel leading
    to an information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5706">CVE-2015-5706</a>

    <p>An user triggerable use-after-free vulnerability in path lookup in
    the Linux kernel could potentially lead to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5707">CVE-2015-5707</a>

    <p>An integer overflow in the SCSI generic driver in the Linux kernel
    was discovered. A local user with write permission on a SCSI generic
    device could potentially exploit this flaw for privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.2.68-1+deb7u3. <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1333">CVE-2015-1333</a>, <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4692">CVE-2015-4692</a> and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5706">CVE-2015-5706</a> do not affect the wheezy distribution.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.16.7-ckt11-1+deb8u3, except <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5364">CVE-2015-5364</a> and <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5366">CVE-2015-5366</a>
which were fixed already in DSA-3313-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.3-1 or earlier versions.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.</p>
