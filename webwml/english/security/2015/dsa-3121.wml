<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in file, a tool/library to 
determine a file type. Processing a malformed file could result in
denial of service. Most of the changes are related to parsing ELF
files.</p>

<p>As part of the fixes, several limits on aspects of the detection were
added or tightened, sometimes resulting in messages like <q>recursion
limit exceeded</q> or <q>too many program header sections</q>.</p>

<p>To mitigate such shortcomings, these limits are controllable by a new
- -P, --parameter option in the file program.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.11-2+deb7u7.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), these problems will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:5.21+15-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your file packages.</p>
