<p>Evgeny Sidorov discovered that libcrypto++, a general purpose C++
cryptographic library, did not properly implement blinding to mask
private key operations for the Rabin-Williams digital signature
algorithm. This could allow remote attackers to mount a timing attack
and retrieve the user's private key.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.6.1-6+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem will be fixed
in version 5.6.1-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.6.1-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcrypto++ packages.</p>
