<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in libgcrypt:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591">CVE-2014-3591</a>

    <p>The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-0837">CVE-2015-0837</a>

    <p>The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.5.0-5+deb7u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libgcrypt11 packages.</p>
