<p>Emanuele Rocca discovered that ppp, a daemon implementing the
Point-to-Point Protocol, was subject to a buffer overflow when
communicating with a RADIUS server. This would allow unauthenticated
users to cause a denial-of-service by crashing the daemon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.5-5.1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.4.6-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ppp packages.</p>
