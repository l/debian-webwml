<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered a race condition flaw in spice's
worker_update_monitors_config() function, leading to a heap-based memory
corruption. A malicious user in a guest can take advantage of this flaw
to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) or, potentially
execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting
QEMU process.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.</p>
