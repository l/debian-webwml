<p>It was discovered that lsyncd, a daemon to synchronize local directories
using rsync, performed insufficient sanitising of filenames which might
result in the execution of arbitrary commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.7-3+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.1.5-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lsyncd packages.</p>
