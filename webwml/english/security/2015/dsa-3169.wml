<p>Several vulnerabilities have been fixed in eglibc, Debian's version of
the GNU C library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3406">CVE-2012-3406</a>

    <p>The vfprintf function in stdio-common/vfprintf.c in GNU C Library (aka
    glibc) 2.5, 2.12, and probably other versions does not <q>properly restrict
    the use of</q> the alloca function when allocating the SPECS array, which
    allows context-dependent attackers to bypass the FORTIFY_SOURCE
    format-string protection mechanism and cause a denial of service (crash)
    or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted format string using
    positional parameters and a large number of format specifiers, a different
    vulnerability than 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3404">\
    CVE-2012-3404</a> and 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3405">\
    CVE-2012-3405</a>.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2013-7424">CVE-2013-7424</a>

    <p>An invalid free flaw was found in glibc's getaddrinfo() function when used
    with the AI_IDN flag. A remote attacker able to make an application call
    this function could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the
    permissions of the user running the application. Note that this flaw only
    affected applications using glibc compiled with libidn support.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-4043">CVE-2014-4043</a>

    <p>The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen function in glibc before 2.20 does not
    copy its path argument in accordance with the POSIX specification, which
    allows context-dependent attackers to trigger use-after-free
    vulnerabilities.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9402">CVE-2014-9402</a>

    <p>The getnetbyname function in glibc 2.21 or earlier will enter an infinite
    loop if the DNS backend is activated in the system Name Service Switch
    configuration, and the DNS resolver receives a positive answer while
    processing the network name.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1472">CVE-2015-1472</a> / 
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1473">CVE-2015-1473</a>

    <p>Under certain conditions wscanf can allocate too little memory for the
    to-be-scanned arguments and overflow the allocated buffer. The incorrect
    use of "__libc_use_alloca (newsize)" caused a different (and weaker)
    policy to be enforced which could allow a denial of service attack.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), all the above issues are fixed in version
2.19-15 of the glibc package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your eglibc packages.</p>
