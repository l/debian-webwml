<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3591">CVE-2014-3591</a>

    <p>The Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel
    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext
    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a
    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.</p></li>

    <p>The modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a
    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when
    accessing its internal pre-computed table.</p></li>
