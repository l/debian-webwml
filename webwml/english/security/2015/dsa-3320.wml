<p>It was discovered that OpenAFS, the implementation of the distributed
filesystem AFS, contained several flaws that could result in
information leak, denial-of-service or kernel panic.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.6.1-3+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.6.9-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openafs packages.</p>
