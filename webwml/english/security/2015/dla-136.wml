<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>James Clawson discovered that websvn, a web viewer for Subversion
repositories, would follow symlinks in a repository when presenting a
file for download. An attacker with repository write access could
thereby access any file on disk readable by the user the webserver
runs as.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in websvn version 2.3.3-1+deb6u1</p>
