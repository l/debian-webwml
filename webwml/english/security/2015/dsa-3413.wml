<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure
Sockets Layer toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3194">CVE-2015-3194</a>

    <p>Loic Jonas Etienne of Qnective AG discovered that the signature
    verification routines will crash with a NULL pointer dereference if
    presented with an ASN.1 signature using the RSA PSS algorithm and
    absent mask generation function parameter. A remote attacker can
    exploit this flaw to crash any certificate verification operation
    and mount a denial of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3195">CVE-2015-3195</a>

    <p>Adam Langley of Google/BoringSSL discovered that OpenSSL will leak
    memory when presented with a malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3196">CVE-2015-3196</a>

    <p>A race condition flaw in the handling of PSK identify hints was
    discovered, potentially leading to a double free of the identify
    hint data.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.1e-2+deb7u18.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.1k-3+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2e-1 or earlier.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.</p>
