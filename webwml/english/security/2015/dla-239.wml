<p>Two critical vulnerabilities have been found in the CUPS printing
system:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1158">CVE-2015-1158</a>

<p>- Improper Update of Reference Count
    Cupsd uses reference-counted strings with global scope. When parsing
    a print job request, cupsd over-decrements the reference count for a
    string from the request. As a result, an attacker can prematurely
    free an arbitrary string of global scope. They can use this to
    dismantle ACL’s protecting privileged operations, and upload a
    replacement configuration file, and subsequently run arbitrary code
    on a target machine.</p>

    <p>This bug is exploitable in default configurations, and does not
    require any special permissions other than the basic ability to
    print.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1159">CVE-2015-1159</a>

<p>- Cross-Site Scripting
    A cross-site scripting bug in the CUPS templating engine allows the
    above bug to be exploited when a user browses the web. This XSS is
    reachable in the default configuration for Linux instances of CUPS,
    and allows an attacker to bypass default configuration settings that
    bind the CUPS scheduler to the ‘localhost’ or loopback interface.</p></li>
