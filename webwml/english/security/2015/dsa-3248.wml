<p>It was discovered that missing input saniting in Snoopy, a PHP class that
simulates a web browser may result in the execution of arbitrary
commands.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0.0-1~deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem was fixed before
the initial release.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libphp-snoopy packages.</p>
