<p>Tilmann Haak from xing.com discovered that XML::LibXML, a Perl interface
to the libxml2 library, did not respect the expand_entities parameter to
disable processing of external entities in some circumstances. This may
allow attackers to gain read access to otherwise protected resources,
depending on how the library is used.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.0001+dfsg-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0116+dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0116+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libxml-libxml-perl packages.</p>
