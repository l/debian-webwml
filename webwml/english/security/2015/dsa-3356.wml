<p>Denis Andzakovic discovered that OpenLDAP, a free implementation of the
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, does not properly handle BER
data. An unauthenticated remote attacker can use this flaw to cause a
denial of service (slapd daemon crash) via a specially crafted packet.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.4.31-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.40+dfsg-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.42+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openldap packages.</p>
