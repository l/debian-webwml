<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an
implementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in the execution
of arbitrary code, breakouts of the Java sandbox, information
disclosure or denial of service.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 “Squeeze”, these problems have been fixed in version
6b35-1.13.7-1~deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openjdk-6 packages.</p>
