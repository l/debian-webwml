    <p>The encodes() function in pack.c had an off-by-one error that could
    lead to a stack-based buffer overflow. This could allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code
    execution.</p></li>

    <p>The REXML parser could be coerced into allocating large string
    objects that could consume all available memory on the system. This
    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).</p></li>
