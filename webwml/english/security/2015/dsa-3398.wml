<p>Tobias Brunner found an authentication bypass vulnerability in
strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.</p>

<p>Due to insufficient validation of its local state the server
implementation of the EAP-MSCHAPv2 protocol in the eap-mschapv2 plugin
can be tricked into successfully concluding the authentication without
providing valid credentials.</p>

<p>It's possible to recognize such attacks by looking at the server logs.
The following log message would be seen during the client
authentication:</p>

<p><samp>EAP method EAP_MSCHAPV2 succeeded, no MSK established</samp></p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 4.5.2-1.5+deb7u8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.2.1-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 5.3.3-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.3.3-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your strongswan packages.</p>
