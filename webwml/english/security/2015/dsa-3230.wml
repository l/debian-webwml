<p>James P. Turk discovered that the ReST renderer in django-markupfield,
a custom Django field for easy use of markup in text fields, didn't
disable the ..raw directive, allowing remote attackers to include
arbitrary files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.1-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your django-markupfield packages.</p>
