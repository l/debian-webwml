<p>A vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTP Server.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3183">CVE-2015-3183</a>

    <p>Apache HTTP Server did not properly parse chunk headers, which
    allowed remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling via a
    crafted request. This flaw relates to mishandling of large
    chunk-size values and invalid chunk-extension characters in
    modules/http/http_filters.c.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version
2.2.16-6+squeeze15 of apache2.</p>

<p>We recommend you to upgrade your apache2 packages.</p>
