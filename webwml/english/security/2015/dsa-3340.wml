<p>Dawid Golunski discovered that when running under PHP-FPM in a threaded
environment, Zend Framework, a PHP framework, did not properly handle
XML data in multibyte encoding. This could be used by remote attackers
to perform an XML External Entity attack via crafted XML data.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.11.13-1.1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.9+dfsg-2+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.12.14+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.12.14+dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zendframework packages.</p>
