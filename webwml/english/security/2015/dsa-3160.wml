<p>Olivier Fourdan discovered that missing input validation in the Xserver's
handling of XkbSetGeometry requests may result in an information leak
or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.12.4-6+deb7u6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:1.16.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xorg-server packages.</p>
