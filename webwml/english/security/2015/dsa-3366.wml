<p>A remotely triggerable use-after-free vulnerability was found in
rpcbind, a server that converts RPC program numbers into universal
addresses. A remote attacker can take advantage of this flaw to mount a
denial of service (rpcbind crash).</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 0.2.0-8+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.1-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rpcbind packages.</p>
