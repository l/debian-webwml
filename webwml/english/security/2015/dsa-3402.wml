<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in symfony, a framework to
create websites and web applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8124">CVE-2015-8124</a>

    <p>The RedTeam Pentesting GmbH team discovered a session fixation
    vulnerability within the <q>Remember Me</q> login feature, allowing an
    attacker to impersonate the victim towards the web application if
    the session id value was previously known to the attacker.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8125">CVE-2015-8125</a>

    <p>Several potential remote timing attack vulnerabilities were
    discovered in classes from the Symfony Security component and in the
    legacy CSRF implementation from the Symfony Form component.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.3.21+dfsg-4+deb8u2.</p>
