<p>It was discovered that GnuTLS, a library implementing the TLS and SSL
protocols, incorrectly validates the first byte of padding in CBC modes.
A remote attacker can possibly take advantage of this flaw to perform a
padding oracle attack.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.12.20-8+deb7u4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls26 packages.</p>
