<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Weimer, of Red Hat Product Security, discovered an issue in
condor, a distributed workload management system. Upon job completion,
it can optionally notify a user by sending an email; the mailx
invocation used in that process allowed for any authenticated user
able to submit jobs, to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of
the condor user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.8.2~dfsg.1-1+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version
8.2.3~dfsg.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your condor packages.</p>
