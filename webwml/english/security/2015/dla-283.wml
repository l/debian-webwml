<p>A vulnerability has been found in the International Components
for Unicode (ICU) library:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4760">CVE-2015-4760</a>

    <p>It was discovered that ICU Layout Engine was missing multiple
    boundary checks. These could lead to buffer overflows and memory
    corruption. A specially crafted file could cause an application
    using ICU to parse untrusted font files to crash and, possibly,
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the squeeze distribution, these issues have been fixed in version
4.4.1-8+squeeze4 of icu.</p>

<p>We recommend to upgrade your icu packages.</p>
