<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LibreOffice, a
full-featured office productivity:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4551">CVE-2015-4551</a>

    <p>Federico Scrinzi discovered an information leak in the handling of
    ODF documents. Quoting from
    <url "https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2015-4551/" />:
    The LinkUpdateMode feature controls whether documents inserted into
    Writer or Calc via links will either not get updated, or prompt to
    update, or automatically update, when the parent document is loaded.
    The configuration of this option was stored in the document. That
    flawed approach enabled documents to be crafted with links to
    plausible targets on the victims host computer. The contents of
    those automatically inserted after load links can be concealed in
    hidden sections and retrieved by the attacker if the document is
    saved and returned to sender, or via http requests if the user has
    selected lower security settings for that document.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5212">CVE-2015-5212</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in parsing the printer setup information in ODF
    documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5213">CVE-2015-5213</a> /
    <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5214">CVE-2015-5214</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow and an integer oect memory management in parsing
    Microsoft Word documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>
