<p>CakePHP, an open-source web application framework for PHP, was
vulnerable to SSRF (Server Side
Request Forgery) attacks. Remote attacker can utilize it for at least
DoS (Denial of Service) attacks, if the target application accepts XML
as an input. It is caused by insecure design of Cake's Xml class.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 Squeeze, this issue has been fixed in cakephp version
1.3.2-1.1+deb6u11.</p>
