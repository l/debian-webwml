<p>Two vulnerabilities have been found in unzip, a de-archiver for .zip
files. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7696">CVE-2015-7696</a>

    <p>Gustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain
    password protected archives. If a user or automated system were
    tricked into processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker
    could possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7697">CVE-2015-7697</a>

    <p>Gustavo Grieco discovered that unzip incorrectly handled certain
    malformed archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into
    processing a specially crafted zip archive, an attacker could
    possibly cause unzip to hang, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0-8+deb7u4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0-16+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 6.0-19.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 6.0-19.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.</p>
