<p>Several security issues have been found in the server components of the
version control system subversion.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3184">CVE-2015-3184</a>

    <p>Subversion's mod_authz_svn does not properly restrict anonymous
    access in some mixed anonymous/authenticated environments when
    using Apache httpd 2.4.  The result is that anonymous access may
    be possible to files for which only authenticated access should
    be possible. This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution
    (wheezy) because it only contains Apache httpd 2.2.</p>

<p></p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3187">CVE-2015-3187</a>

    <p>Subversion servers, both httpd and svnserve, will reveal some
    paths that should be hidden by path-based authz.  When a node is
    copied from an unreadable location to a readable location the
    unreadable path may be revealed.  This vulnerablity only reveals
    the path, it does not reveal the contents of the path.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1.6.17dfsg-4+deb7u10.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.10-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems will be fixed in
version 1.9.0-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your subversion packages.</p>
