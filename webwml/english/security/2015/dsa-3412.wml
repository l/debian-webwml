<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luca Bruno discovered an integer overflow flaw leading to a stack-based
buffer overflow in redis, a persistent key-value database. A remote
attacker can use this flaw to cause a denial of service (application
crash).</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:2.8.17-1+deb8u3.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 2:3.0.5-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2:3.0.5-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your redis packages.</p>
