<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update backports changes from the commons-collections 3.2.2 release
which disable the deserialisation of the functors classes unless the
system property org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization
is set to <q>true</q>. This fixes a vulnerability in unsafe applications
deserialising objects from untrusted sources without sanitising the
input data. Classes considered unsafe are: CloneTransformer, ForClosure,
InstantiateFactory, InstantiateTransformer, InvokerTransformer,
PrototypeCloneFactory, PrototypeSerializationFactory and WhileClosure.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.2.1-5+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.1-7+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.2.2-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcommons-collections3-java packages.</p>
