<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The following two issues have recently been fixed in Debian LTS (squeeze)
for the fuseiso package.</p>

<p>Issue 1</p>

    <p>An integer overflow, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow flaw was
    found in the way FuseISO, a FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem
    images, performed reading of certain ZF blocks of particular inodes.
    A remote attacker could provide a specially-crafted ISO file that,
    when mounted via the fuseiso tool would lead to fuseiso binary crash.</p>

    <p>This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
    Security Team.</p>

    <p>The issue got resolve by bailing out before ZF blocks that exceed the
    supported block size of 2^17 are to be read.</p>

<p>Issue 2</p>

    <p>A stack-based buffer overflow flaw was found in the way FuseISO, a
    FUSE module to mount ISO filesystem images, performed expanding of
    directory portions for absolute path filename entries. A remote
    attacker could provide a specially-crafted ISO file that, when
    mounted via fuseiso tool would lead to fuseiso binary crash or,
    potentially, arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user
    running the fuseiso executable.</p>

    <p>This issue was discovered by Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product
    Security Team.</p>

    <p>The issue got resolved by checking the resulting length of an
    absolute path name and by bailing out if the platform's PATH_MAX
    value gets exceeded.</p>
