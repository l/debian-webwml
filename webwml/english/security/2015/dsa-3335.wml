<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Request Tracker, an extensible trouble-ticket
tracking system is susceptible to a cross-site scripting attack via the
user and group rights management pages (<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475">CVE-2015-5475</a>) and via the
cryptography interface, allowing an attacker with a carefully-crafted
key to inject JavaScript into RT's user interface. Installations which
use neither GnuPG nor S/MIME are unaffected by the second cross-site
scripting vulnerability.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 4.0.7-5+deb7u4. The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is only
affected by <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5475">CVE-2015-5475</a>.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.8-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.11-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your request-tracker4 packages.</p>
