<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu-kvm, a full
virtualization solution on x86 hardware.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5165">CVE-2015-5165</a>

    <p>Donghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network
    card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload
    emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory
    from the QEMU process's heap.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5745">CVE-2015-5745</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU
    handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this
    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.2+dfsg-6+deb7u9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qemu-kvm packages.</p>
