<p>Security support for the chromium web browser is now discontinued
for the stable distribution (wheezy).  Chromium upstream stopped
supporting wheezy's build environment (gcc 4.7, make, etc.), so
there is no longer any practical way to continue building security
updates.</p>

<p>Chromium users that desire continued security updates are encouraged
to upgrade early to the upcoming stable release (jessie), Debian 8.</p>

<p>An alternative is to switch to the iceweasel web browser, which will
continue to recieve security updates in wheezy for some time.</p>

<p>Note that until the official release happens, chromium package updates
for jessie may have a larger than usual delay due to possible bugs and
testing migration rules.</p>

<p>Also, there will be no more DSAs announcing chromium package updates
until jessie becomes officially released.</p>

<p>Instructions for upgrading from Debian 7 to 8 are available at:
<url "https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/amd64/release-notes/ch-upgrading.en.html" /></p>

<p>Media for installing Debian 8 from scratch are also available
(the release candidate media, jessie_di_rc1, are recommended):</p>
