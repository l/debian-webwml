<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that FUSE, a Filesystem in USErspace, does not
scrub the environment before executing mount or umount with elevated
privileges. A local user can take advantage of this flaw to overwrite
arbitrary files and gain elevated privileges by accessing debugging
features via the environment that would not normally be safe for
unprivileged users.</p>

<p>For the old-oldstable distribution (squeeze-lts), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.8.4-1.1+deb6u1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fuse packages.</p>
