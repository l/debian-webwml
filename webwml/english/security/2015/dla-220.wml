<p>Jann Horn discovered that the source package integrity verification in
dpkg-source can be bypassed via a specially crafted Debian source
control file (.dsc). Note that this flaw only affects extraction of
local Debian source packages via dpkg-source but not the installation of
packages from the Debian archive.</p>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.15.12.  This also fixes a similar bug discovered
by Ansgar Burchardt and a bug in the same area discovered by Roger
Leigh.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem was fixed in
version 1.16.16.</p>

<p>The stable distribution (jessie) was not affected by this problem as
it was fixed before release.</p>
