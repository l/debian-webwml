<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrey Labunets of Facebook discovered that cURL, an URL transfer
library, fails to properly handle URLs with embedded end-of-line
characters. An attacker able to make an application using libcurl to
access a specially crafted URL via an HTTP proxy could use this flaw to
do additional requests in a way that was not intended, or insert
additional request headers into the request.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.26.0-1+wheezy12.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem will be
fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 7.38.0-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your curl packages.</p>
