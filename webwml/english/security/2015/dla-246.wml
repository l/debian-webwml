<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The linux-2.6 update issued as DLA-246-1 caused regressions.  This
update corrects the defective patches applied in that update causing
these problems.  For reference the original advisory text follows.</p>

<p>This update fixes the CVEs described below.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2011-5321">CVE-2011-5321</a>

    <p>Jiri Slaby discovered that tty_driver_lookup_tty() may leak a
    reference to the tty driver.  A local user could use this flaw
    to crash the system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-6689">CVE-2012-6689</a>

    <p>Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered that non-root user-space processes
    can send forged Netlink notifications to other processes.  A local
    user could use this flaw for denial of service or privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3184">CVE-2014-3184</a>

    <p>Ben Hawkes discovered that various HID drivers may over-read the
    report descriptor buffer, possibly resulting in a crash if a HID
    with a crafted descriptor is plugged in.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8159">CVE-2014-8159</a>

    <p>It was found that the Linux kernel's InfiniBand/RDMA subsystem did
    not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory
    regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with
    access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to
    crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the
    system.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9683">CVE-2014-9683</a>

    <p>Dmitry Chernenkov discovered that eCryptfs writes past the end of
    the allocated buffer during encrypted filename decoding, resulting
    in local denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9728">CVE-2014-9728</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9729">CVE-2014-9729</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9730">CVE-2014-9730</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-9731">CVE-2014-9731</a> / <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a>

    <p>Carl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is
    missing several necessary length checks.  A local user that can
    mount devices could use these various flaws to crash the system,
    to leak information from the kernel, or possibly for privilege
    escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a>

    <p>Red Hat discovered that the pipe iovec read and write
    implementations may iterate over the iovec twice but will modify
    the iovec such that the second iteration accesses the wrong
    memory.  A local user could use this flaw to crash the system or
    possibly for privilege escalation.  This may also result in data
    corruption and information leaks in pipes between non-malicious
    processes.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2041">CVE-2015-2041</a>

    <p>Sasha Levin discovered that the LLC subsystem exposed some
    variables as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this
    possibly allows privilege escalation from a process with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability; it also results in a trivial information
    leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2042">CVE-2015-2042</a>

    <p>Sasha Levin discovered that the RDS subsystem exposed some
    variables as sysctls with the wrong type. On a 64-bit kernel, this
    results in a trivial information leak.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2830">CVE-2015-2830</a>

    <p>Andrew Lutomirski discovered that when a 64-bit task on an amd64
    kernel makes a fork(2) or clone(2) system call using int $0x80,
    the 32-bit compatibility flag is set (correctly) but is not
    cleared on return. As a result, both seccomp and audit will
    misinterpret the following system call by the task(s), possibly
    leading to a violation of security policy.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2922">CVE-2015-2922</a>

    <p>Modio AB discovered that the IPv6 subsystem would process a router
    advertisement that specifies no route but only a hop limit, which
    would then be applied to the interface that received it. This can
    result in loss of IPv6 connectivity beyond the local network.</p>

    <p>This may be mitigated by disabling processing of IPv6 router
    advertisements if they are not needed:</p>
<pre>
        sysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0
        sysctl net.ipv6.conf.&lt;interface&gt;.accept_ra=0
</pre></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3339">CVE-2015-3339</a>

    <p>It was found that the execve(2) system call can race with inode
    attribute changes made by chown(2).  Although chown(2) clears the
    setuid/setgid bits of a file if it changes the respective owner ID,
    this race condition could result in execve(2) setting effective
    uid/gid to the new owner ID, a privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 2.6.32-48squeeze12.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems were fixed in
linux version 3.2.68-1+deb7u1 or earlier, except for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a> and
<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a> which will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems were fixed in
linux version 3.16.7-ckt11-1 or earlier, except for <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4167">CVE-2015-4167</a> which
will be fixed later.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your linux-2.6 packages.</p>
