<p>Several vulnerabilities have been found in PostgreSQL-9.1, a SQL
database system.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3165">CVE-2015-3165</a>

<p>(Remote crash)</p>

    <p>SSL clients disconnecting just before the authentication timeout
    expires can cause the server to crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3166">CVE-2015-3166</a>

<p>(Information exposure)</p>

    <p>The replacement implementation of snprintf() failed to check for
    errors reported by the underlying system library calls; the main
    case that might be missed is out-of-memory situations. In the worst
    case this might lead to information exposure.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3167">CVE-2015-3167</a>

<p>(Possible side-channel key exposure)</p>

    <p>In contrib/pgcrypto, some cases of decryption with an incorrect key
    could report other error message texts. Fix by using a
    one-size-fits-all message.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 9.1.16-0+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 9.1.16-0+deb8u1. (Jessie contains a reduced postgresql-9.1
package; only <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-3166">CVE-2015-3166</a> is fixed in the produced binary package
postgresql-plperl-9.1. We recommend to upgrade to postgresql-9.4 to get
the full set of fixes. See the Jessie release notes for details.)</p>

<p>The testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution (sid)
do not contain the postgresql-9.1 package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql-9.1 packages.</p>
