<p>Adam discovered several problems in inspircd, an IRC daemon:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>An incomplete patch for <a 
	href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-1836">CVE-2012-1836</a> 
	failed to adequately resolve the problem where maliciously crafted DNS 
	requests could lead to remote code execution through a heap-based buffer 
	overflow.</p></li>

	<li><p>The incorrect processing of specific DNS packets could trigger an
	infinite loop, thus resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.5-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and unstable
distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in version 2.0.16-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your inspircd packages.</p>
