<p>Michal Kowalczyk discovered that missing input sanitising in the
foomatic-rip print filter might result in the execution of arbitrary
commands.</p>

<p>The oldstable distribution (wheezy) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.61-5+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups-filters packages.</p>
