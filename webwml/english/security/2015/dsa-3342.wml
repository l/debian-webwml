<p>Loren Maggiore of Trail of Bits discovered that the 3GP parser of VLC, a
multimedia player and streamer, could dereference an arbitrary pointer
due to insufficient restrictions on a writable buffer. This could allow
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted 3GP files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.0~rc2-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your vlc packages.</p>
