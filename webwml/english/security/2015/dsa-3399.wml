<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the libpng PNG library.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7981">CVE-2015-7981</a>

    <p>Qixue Xiao discovered an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in the
    png_convert_to_rfc1123 function. A remote attacker can potentially
    take advantage of this flaw to cause disclosure of information from
    process memory.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-8126">CVE-2015-8126</a>

    <p>Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in the png_set_PLTE and
    png_get_PLTE functions. A remote attacker can take advantage of this
    flaw to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a small
    bit-depth value in an IHDR (image header) chunk in a PNG image.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.2.49-1+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.50-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2.54-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpng packages.</p>
