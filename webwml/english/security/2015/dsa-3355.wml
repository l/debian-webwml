<p>Florian Weimer of Red Hat Product Security discovered that libvdpau, the
VDPAU wrapper library, did not properly validate environment variables,
allowing local attackers to gain additional privileges.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.4.1-7+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.1.1-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libvdpau packages.</p>
