<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Apache commons collection suffered from security issues, making
applications to accept serialized objects from untrusted sources. Remote
attackers might take advantage of these issues to execute arbitrary Java
functions and even inject manipulated bytecode.</p>

<p>This release of libcommons-collection3-java prevents these issues by disabling
the deserialization of the functors classes, unless the system property
org.apache.commons.collections.enableUnsafeSerialization is set to <q>true</q>.
Classes considered unsafe are: CloneTransformer, ForClosure,
InstantiateFactory, InstantiateTransformer, InvokerTransformer,
PrototypeCloneFactory, PrototypeSerializationFactory and WhileClosure.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these problems have been fixed in
libcommons-collections3-java version 3.2.1-4+deb6u1. We recommend you to
upgrade your libcommons-collections3-java packages.</p>
