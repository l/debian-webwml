<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Google security team and the smart hardware research group of
Alibaba security team discovered a flaw in how wpa_supplicant used SSID
information when creating or updating P2P peer entries. A remote
attacker can use this flaw to cause wpa_supplicant to crash, expose
memory contents, and potentially execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0-3+deb7u2. Note that this issue does not affect the binary
packages distributed in Debian as the CONFIG_P2P is not enabled for
the build.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 2.3-1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wpa packages.</p>
