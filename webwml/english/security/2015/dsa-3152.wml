<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw was found in the test_compr_eb() function allowing out-of-bounds
read and write access to memory locations. By carefully crafting a
corrupt ZIP archive an attacker can trigger a heap overflow, resulting
in application crash or possibly having other unspecified impact.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-8+deb7u2. Additionally this update corrects a defective
patch applied to address <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139">CVE-2014-8139</a>, which caused a regression with
executable jar files.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0-15. The defective patch applied to address <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8139">CVE-2014-8139</a> was
corrected in version 6.0-16.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip packages.</p>
