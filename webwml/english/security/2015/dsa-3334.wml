<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kurt Roeckx discovered that decoding a specific certificate with very
long DistinguishedName (DN) entries leads to double free. A remote
attacker can take advantage of this flaw by creating a specially crafted
certificate that, when processed by an application compiled against
GnuTLS, could cause the application to crash resulting in a denial of
service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.8-6+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls28 packages.</p>
