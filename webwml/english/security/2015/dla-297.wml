<define-tag moreinfo>
 <p>Wesnoth implements a text preprocessing language that is used in
 conjunction with its own game scripting language. It also has a
 built-in Lua interpreter and API.
 Both the Lua API and the preprocessor make use of the same function
 (filesystem::get_wml_location()) to resolve file paths so that only
 content from the user's data directory can be read.</p>

 <p>However, the function did not explicitly disallow files with the .pbl
 extension. The contents of these files could thus be stored in saved
 game files or even transmitted directly to other users in a networked
 game. Among the information that's compromised is a user-defined
 passphrase used to authenticate uploads to the game's content server.</p>
