<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Alex Rousskov of The Measurement Factory discovered that Squid3, a fully
featured web proxy cache, does not correctly handle CONNECT method peer
responses when configured with cache_peer and operating on explicit
proxy traffic. This could allow remote clients to gain unrestricted
access through a gateway proxy to its backend proxy.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.1.20-2.2+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.8-6+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squid3 packages.</p>
