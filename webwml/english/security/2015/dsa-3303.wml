<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the texttopdf utility, part of cups-filters, was
susceptible to multiple heap-based buffer overflows due to improper
handling of print jobs with a specially crafted line size. This could
allow remote attackers to crash texttopdf or possibly execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.18-2.1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.61-5+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.71-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cups-filters packages.</p>
