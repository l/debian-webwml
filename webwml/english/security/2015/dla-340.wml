<p>Several vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation
of Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2695">CVE-2015-2695</a>

   <p>It was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()
   on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API
   library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a
   process crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2697">CVE-2015-2697</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the build_principal_va() function incorrectly
    handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage
    of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a
    large realm field beginning with a null byte.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the oldoldstable distribution (squeeze), these problems have been
fixed in version 1.8.3+dfsg-4squeeze10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
