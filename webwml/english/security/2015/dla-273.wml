<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Fernando Mu√±oz discovered a security issue on the HTML syntax checker and
reformatter tidy. Tidy did not properly process specific character sequences,
and a remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a DoS, or probably,
execute arbitrary code. Two different CVEs were assigned to this issue.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5522">CVE-2015-5522</a>

    <p>Malformed html documents could lead to a heap-buffer-overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5523">CVE-2015-5523</a>

    <p>Malformed html documents could lead to allocate 4Gb of memory.</p>

<p>For the Squeeze distribution, this issue has been fixed in the
20091223cvs-1+deb6u1 version of tidy.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tidy packages.</p></li>
