<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple security issues have been found in binutils, a toolbox for
binary file manipulation. These vulnerabilities include multiple memory
safety errors, buffer overflows, use-after-frees and other implementation
errors may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, the bypass of security
restrictions, path traversal attack or denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.22-8+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.25-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your binutils packages.</p>
