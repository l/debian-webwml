<define-tag description>LTS security update</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>JRuby before 1.6.5.1 computes hash values without restricting the ability to
trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers
to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an
application that maintains a hash table. Note: This update includes
corrections to the original fix for later Debian releases to avoid the issues
identified in <a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-5370">CVE-2012-5370</a>.</p>
