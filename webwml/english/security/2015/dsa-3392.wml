<p>Pengsu Cheng discovered that FreeImage, a library for graphic image
formats, contained multiple integer underflows that could lead to a
denial of service: remote attackers were able to trigger a crash by
supplying a specially crafted image.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 3.15.1-1.1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.15.4-4.2.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and unstable distribution
(sid), this problem has been fixed in version 3.15.4-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeimage packages.</p>
