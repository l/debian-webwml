<p>Fernando Mu√±oz discovered that invalid HTML input passed to tidy, an
HTML syntax checker and reformatter, could trigger a buffer overflow.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or potentially execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>Geoff McLane also discovered that a similar issue could trigger an
integer overflow, leading to a memory allocation of 4GB. This could
allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service by saturating the
target's memory.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 20091223cvs-1.2+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 20091223cvs-1.4+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tidy packages.</p>
