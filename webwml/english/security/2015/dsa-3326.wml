<p>William Robinet and Stefan Cornelius discovered an integer overflow in
Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF interpreter, which may result in
denial of service or potentially execution of arbitrary code if a
specially crafted file is opened.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.05~dfsg-6.3+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.06~dfsg-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.15~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.15~dfsg-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ghostscript packages.</p>
