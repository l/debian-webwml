<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Frediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered several vulnerabilities in spice,
a SPICE protocol client and server library. A malicious guest can
exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash),
execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the hosting
QEMU process or read and write arbitrary memory locations on the host.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed
in version 0.11.0-1+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1+deb8u2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.12.5-1.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your spice packages.</p>
