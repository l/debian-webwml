<p>Alexander Cherepanov discovered that p7zip is susceptible to a
directory traversal vulnerability.  While extracting an archive, it
will extract symlinks and then follow them if they are referenced in
further entries.  This can be exploited by a rogue archive to write
files outside the current directory.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.1+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 9.20.1~dfsg.1-4.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your p7zip packages.</p>
