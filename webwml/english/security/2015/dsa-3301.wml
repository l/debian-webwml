<p>Charlie Smurthwaite of aTech Media discovered a flaw in HAProxy, a fast
and reliable load balancing reverse proxy, when HTTP pipelining is used.
A client can take advantage of this flaw to cause data corruption and
retrieve uninitialized memory contents that exhibit data from a past
request or session.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.8-3+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your haproxy packages.</p>
