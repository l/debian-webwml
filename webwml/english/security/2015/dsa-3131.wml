<p>John Houwer discovered a way to cause xdg-open, a tool that automatically
opens URLs in a user's preferred application, to execute arbitrary
commands remotely.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-6+deb7u2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem has been fixed in version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-7.3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.</p>
