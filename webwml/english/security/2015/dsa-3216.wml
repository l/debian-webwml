<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Tor, a connection-based
low-latency anonymous communication system:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2928">CVE-2015-2928</a>

    <p><q>disgleirio</q> discovered that a malicious client could trigger an
    assertion failure in a Tor instance providing a hidden service,
    thus rendering the service inaccessible.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-2929">CVE-2015-2929</a>

    <p><q>DonnchaC</q> discovered that Tor clients would crash with an
    assertion failure upon parsing specially crafted hidden service
    descriptors.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Introduction points would accept multiple INTRODUCE1 cells on one
circuit, making it inexpensive for an attacker to overload a hidden
service with introductions. Introduction points now no longer allow
multiple cells of that type on the same circuit.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.4.27-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), these problems have been fixed in
version 0.2.5.12-1.</p>

<p>For the experimental distribution, these problems have been
fixed in version 0.2.6.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tor packages.</p>
