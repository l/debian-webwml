<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Sockets
Layer toolkit.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-8176">CVE-2014-8176</a>

    <p>Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered
    that an invalid memory free could be triggered when buffering DTLS
    data. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code. This issue only
    affected the oldstable distribution (wheezy).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1789">CVE-2015-1789</a>

    <p>Robert Swiecki and Hanno B??ck discovered that the X509_cmp_time
    function could read a few bytes out of bounds. This could allow remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via crafted
    certificates and CRLs.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1790">CVE-2015-1790</a>

    <p>Michal Zalewski discovered that the PKCS#7 parsing code did not
    properly handle missing content which could lead to a NULL pointer
    dereference. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
    service (crash) via crafted ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1791">CVE-2015-1791</a>

    <p>Emilia K??sper discovered that a race condition could occur due to
    incorrect handling of NewSessionTicket in a multi-threaded client,
    leading to a double free. This could allow remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service (crash).</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-1792">CVE-2015-1792</a>

    <p>Johannes Bauer discovered that the CMS code could enter an infinite
    loop when verifying a signedData message, if presented with an
    unknown hash function OID. This could allow remote attackers to cause
    a denial of service.</p>

<p>Additionally OpenSSL will now reject handshakes using DH parameters
shorter than 768 bits as a countermeasure against the Logjam attack
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-4000">CVE-2015-4000</a>).</p>
