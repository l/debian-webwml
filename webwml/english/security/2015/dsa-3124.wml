<p>Thorsten Eckel of Znuny GMBH and Remo Staeuble of InfoGuard discovered
a privilege escalation vulnerability in otrs2, the Open Ticket Request
System. An attacker with valid OTRS credentials could access and
manipulate ticket data of other users via the GenericInterface, if a
ticket webservice is configured and not additionally secured.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.1.7+dfsg1-8+deb7u5.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 3.3.9-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.9-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs2 packages.</p>
