<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that LibreOffice, an office productivity suite, could
try to write to invalid memory areas when importing malformed RTF files.
This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)
or arbitrary code execution via crafted RTF files.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:3.5.4+dfsg2-0+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1:4.3.3-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:4.3.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libreoffice packages.</p>
