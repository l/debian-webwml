<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javantea discovered a NULL pointer dereference flaw in racoon, the
Internet Key Exchange daemon of ipsec-tools. A remote attacker can use
this flaw to cause the IKE daemon to crash via specially crafted UDP
packets, resulting in a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the oldstable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed
in version 1:0.8.0-14+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been fixed in
version 1:0.8.2+20140711-2+deb8u1.</p>

<p>For the testing distribution (stretch) and the unstable distribution
(sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ipsec-tools packages.</p>
