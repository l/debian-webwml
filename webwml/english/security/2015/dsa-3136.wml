<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A vulnerability was discovered in PolarSSL, a lightweight crypto and
SSL/TLS library. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw using
specially crafted certificates to mount a denial of service against an
application linked against the library (application crash), or
potentially, to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.9-1~deb7u5.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie) and the unstable
distribution (sid), this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your polarssl packages.</p>
