<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jakub Wilk discovered that unace, an utility to extract, test and view
.ace archives, contained an integer overflow leading to a buffer
overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a
specially crafted ace archive, an attacker could cause a denial of
service (application crash) or, possibly, execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2b-10+deb7u1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (jessie), this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2b-12.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2b-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unace packages.</p>
