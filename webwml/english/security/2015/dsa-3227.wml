<p>John Lightsey discovered a format string injection vulnerability in the
localisation of templates in Movable Type, a blogging system. An
unauthenticated remote attacker could take advantage of this flaw to
execute arbitrary code as the web server user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 5.1.4+dfsg-4+deb7u3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your movabletype-opensource packages.</p>
