<define-tag moreinfo>
 <p>A vulnerability was fixed in axis, a SOAP implementation in Java:</p>

 <p>The getCN function in Apache Axis 1.4 and earlier does not properly verify
 that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name
 (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows
 man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a certificate with a
 subject that specifies a common name in a field that is not the CN field.</p>

 <p>Thanks to Markus Koschany for providing the fixed package and David Jorm
 and Arun Neelicattu (Red Hat Product Security) for providing the patch.</p>

<p>For Debian 6 <q>Squeeze</q>, these issues have been fixed in axis version 1.4-12+deb6u1</p>
