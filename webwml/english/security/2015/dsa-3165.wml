<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jiri Horner discovered a way to cause xdg-open, a tool that automatically
opens URLs in a user's preferred application, to execute arbitrary
commands remotely.</p>

<p>This problem only affects /bin/sh implementations that don't sanitize
local variables.  Dash, which is the default /bin/sh in Debian is
affected.  Bash as /bin/sh is known to be unaffected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (wheezy), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0~rc1+git20111210-6+deb7u3.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable (jessie) and unstable (sid) distributions,
this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xdg-utils packages.</p>
