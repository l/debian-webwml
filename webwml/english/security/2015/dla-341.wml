     <p>Use after free vulnerability was found in unserialize() function.
     We can create ZVAL and free it via Serializable::unserialize.
     However the unserialize() will still allow to use R: or r: to set
     references to that already freed memory. It is possible to
     use-after-free attack and execute arbitrary code remotely.</p></li>

     <p>Dangling pointer in the unserialization of ArrayObject items.</p></li>

     <p>A type confusion occurs within SOAP serialize_function_call due
     to an insufficient validation of the headers field.
     In the SoapClient's __call method, the verify_soap_headers_array
     check is applied only to headers retrieved from
     zend_parse_parameters; problem is that a few lines later,
     soap_headers could be updated or even replaced with values from
     the __default_headers object fields.</p></li>
   <li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-6837">CVE-2015-6837</a>
     <p>The XSLTProcessor class misses a few checks on the input from the
     libxslt library. The valuePop() function call is able to return
     NULL pointer and php does not check that.</p></li>

     <p>A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the way PHP's Phar
     extension parsed Phar archives. A specially crafted archive could
     cause PHP to crash.</p></li>
   <li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7804">CVE-2015-7804</a>
     <p>An uninitialized pointer use flaw was found in the
     phar_make_dirstream() function of PHP's Phar extension.
     A specially crafted phar file in the ZIP format with a directory
     entry with a file name "/ZIP" could cause a PHP application
     function to crash.</p></li>
