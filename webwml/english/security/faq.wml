<p>We receive the following questions a bit too often these days, so
their answers are summarized here.</p>

<maketoc>

<toc-add-entry name=signature>The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
   debian-security-announce</a>
   list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
   from one of the security team members to be posted.</p>

<p>Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
   the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
   not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.</p>

<p>Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
   formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="handling">How is security handled in Debian?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
   one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
   release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
   If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
   problem.  The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
   contact the security team already.  Finally, the fix is tested and
   new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
   architectures and uploaded afterwards.  After all of that is done,
   an advisory is published.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=oldversion>Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
   security problem is to make as few changes as possible.  Our users and
   developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
   so any change we make can possibly break someone's system.  This is
   especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
   Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
   no matter how small the change is.</p>

<p>This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
   instead the relevant changes should be backported.  Generally upstream
   maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
   might be able to help.</p>

<p>In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
   when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten.  If that
   happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
   has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=policy>What is the policy for a fixed package to appear in security.debian.org?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Security breakage in the stable distribution warrants a package
   on security.debian.org.  Anything else does not.  The size of a
   breakage is not the real problem here.  Usually the security team
   will prepare packages together with the package maintainer.
   Provided someone (trusted) tracks the problem and gets all the
   needed packages compiled and submit them to the security team, even
   very trivial security problem fixes will make it to
   security.debian.org.  Please see below.</p>

<p>Security updates serve one purpose: to supply a fix for a security
   vulnerability.  They are not a method for sneaking additional
   changes into the stable release without going through normal point
   release procedure.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=localremote>What does <q>local (remote)</q> mean?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A:Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
   with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability.  Some
   vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
   correspond to a daemon listening to a network port.  If they can be
   exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
   while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
   network, we write <q>local (remote)</q> in such cases.</p>

<p>Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
   vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
   through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
   page.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=version>The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
   a vulnerable version!</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
   the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
   this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
   so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
   security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
   a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
   exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian 
   Security Advisory.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=unstable>How is security handled for <tt>unstable</tt>?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: The short answer is: it's not. Unstable is a rapidly moving
   target and the security team does not have the resources needed to
   properly support it. If you want to have a secure (and stable) server
   you are strongly encouraged to stay with stable.</p>
   
<toc-add-entry name=testing>How is security handled for <tt>testing</tt>?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
   encouraged to stay with stable.  However, there is some limited security 
   support for testing:  The Debian testing security team handles unembargoed
   issues for testing.  They will make sure that the fixed
   packages enter testing in the usual way, or, if that takes too long, make
   them available via the the normal <a
   href="http://security.debian.org">http://security.debian.org</a>
   infrastructure.  To use it, make sure the following line is in
   <code>/etc/apt/sources.list</code>:</p>
   <p><code>deb http://security.debian.org testing/updates main</code></p>
   <p>and run <code>apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get upgrade</code> as usual.</p>
   <p>Note that the this doesn't guarantee that all known security bugs are
   fixed in testing!  Some updated packages might be waiting for transition to
   testing, and some bugs might not be publically known, so the Testing
   security team doesn't know about them.   More information about the security
   infrastructure for testing can be found at <a
   href="http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/">http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/</a>.</p>


<toc-add-entry name=testing-security>How does <tt>testing</tt> get security updates?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Security updates will migrate into the <tt>testing</tt>
   distribution via <tt>unstable</tt>.  They are usually uploaded with
   their priority set to high, which will reduce the quarantine time
   to two days.  After this period, the packages will migrate into
   <tt>testing</tt> automatically, given that they are built for all
   architectures and their dependencies are fulfilled in <tt>testing</tt>.</p>

   <p>The <a href="http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/">testing security
   team</a> also makes security fixes available in <a
   href="http://security.debian.org">http://security.debian.org</a> if
   the normal migration process is not fast enough.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=contrib>How is security handled for <tt>contrib</tt> and <tt>non-free</tt>?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib and non-free aren't official
   parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
   supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
   without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
   versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all.  If it
   is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
   provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
   process them and release an advisory.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=mirror>Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.</p>

<p>Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
   that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
   mirrors are not kept up to date. Official mirrors, however, are
   planned to be implemented in the future.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=missing>I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
   derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
   agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
   release an advisory at the same time.  This was decided in order to
   not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
   vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
   support several architectures or binary distributions).  Our own
   security team also prepares advisories in advance.  Every now and
   then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
   advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
   more advisories by number.

<toc-add-entry name=contact>How can I reach the security team?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or 
   team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
   the security team.

<p>If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
   Contact key (key ID <a
   href="http://blackhole.pca.dfn.de:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&amp;exact=on&amp;search=0x363CCD95">\
   0x363CCD95</a>).
   See also the <a href="keys.txt">PGP/GPG keys for the security team</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=discover>I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
   packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team.  If
   the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
   likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
   well.  If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
   security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
   in sync.</p>

<p>If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
   report in the Debian BTS, and tag it <q>security</q>.</p>

<p>If you are a Debian maintainer, <a href="#care">see below</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=care>What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
   my packages?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
   someone else's please always contact the security team.  You can
   reach them via email at team@security.debian.org.  They keep track
   of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
   security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
   sending out security advisories and maintaining
   security.debian.org.</p>

<p>The <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/ch-pkgs#s-bug-security">\
   Developer's Reference</a> has complete instructions on what to do.</p>

<p>It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
   distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
   security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
   work.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=enofile>I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
   advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
   security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
   removed by the time the new one gets installed.  Hence, you'll get
   this `file not found' error.  We don't want to distribute packages
   with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
   distributed through the <a
   href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
   debian-security-announce</a> mailing list. It's best to simply run
   <code>apt-get update</code> before upgrading the package.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=upload>I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: No, you can't.  The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
   by the security team, who have to approve all packages.  You should
   instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team at
   team@security.debian.org.  They will be reviewed by the 
   security team and eventually uploaded, either with or without
   modifications.</p>

<p>If you are not used to security uploads and are not 100% sure that
   your package is sane, please use this way and don't upload to the
   incoming directory.  The security team only has limited options to
   deal with broken packages, especially if they don't use a sane
   version number.  Packages currently cannot be rejected and the
   <abbr title="Build Daemon">buildd</abbr> would be confused if it would be
   possible.  Hence, please
   use mail and help by not adding more pain to the security team.</p>

<p>The <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/ch-pkgs#s-bug-security">\
   Developer's Reference</a> has complete instructions on what to do.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=ppu>I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: Technically speaking, you can.  However, you should not do this,
   since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
   Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
   proposed-updates directory automatically.  If a package with the
   same or a higher version number is already installed into the
   archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
   system.  That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
   security update for this package instead, unless the <q>wrong</q>
   packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected.  Please contact the
   security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
   and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.</p>

<p>The <a href="$(DOC)/developers-reference/ch-pkgs#s-bug-security">\
   Developer's Reference</a> has complete instructions on what to do.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=SecurityUploadQueue>I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
   how can I upload them?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
   version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
   version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
   package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
   for the correct distribution (that is <code>oldstable-security</code> or
   <code>stable-security</code>), that the package contains the original
   source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
   the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
   corresponding security problem (check with <code>interdiff -z</code> and
   both <code>.diff.gz</code> files), that you have proofread the patch at
   least thrice, and that <code>debdiff</code> doesn't display any changes,
   you may upload the files into the incoming directory
   <code>ftp://security-master.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue</code> on the
   security.debian.org directly.  Please send a notification with all details
   and links to team@security.debian.org as well.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=help>How can I help with security?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
   security@debian.org.  If you are able to provide patches, that
   would speed up the process.  Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
   because we already receive them &mdash; but do provide us with
   additional information about things reported on bugtraq.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=proposed-updates>What is the scope of proposed-updates?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
   next revision of Debian stable.  Whenever packages are uploaded by
   a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
   proposed-updates directory.  Since stable is meant to be stable, no
   automatic updates are made.  The security team will upload fixed
   packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
   be placed in proposed-updates first.  Every couple of months the
   Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
   proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
   stable or not.  This is compiled into another revision of stable
   (e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4).  Packages that don't fit will probably be
   rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

<p>Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
   in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
   team.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=composing>How is the security team composed?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: The Debian security team consists of
   <a href="../intro/organization">several officers and secretaries</a>.
   The security team itself appoints people to join the team.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=lifespan>How long will security updates be provided?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: The security team tries to support a stable distribution for
   about one year after the next stable distribution has been
   released, except when another stable distribution is released
   within this year.  It is not possible to support three
   distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
   enough.

<toc-add-entry name=check>How can I check the integrity of packages?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
   the <a href="http://ftp-master.debian.org/archive-key-4.0.asc">\
   public key</a> used for the archive.  The Release file contains the
   MD5 checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain MD5
   checksums of binary and source packages.  Detailed instruction on how
   to check packages integrity can be found in the <a
   href="$(HOME)/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign">\
   Debian Securing Manual</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name=break>What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?</toc-add-entry>
<p>A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
   how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
   security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
   is less serious.  We're talking about random packages that break
   after a security update of a different package.  If you can't
   figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
   security team as well.  You may be redirected to the stable release
   manager though.</p>
