#use wml::debian::template title="Debian security FAQ"

<p>We receive the following questions a bit too often these days, so
they were summarized here.

<p><em>Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!</em>
<p>A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The <a
   href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
   debian-security-announce</a>
   list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
   from one of the security team members to be posted.

<p>Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
   the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
   not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

<p>Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled) and
  formail (from procmail 3.14 only).

<p><em>Q: How is security handled for <tt>testing</tt> and <tt>unstable</tt>?</em>
<p>A: The short answer is: it's not. Testing and unstable are rapidly moving
   targets and the security team does not have the resources needed to
   properly support those. If you want to have a secure (and stable) server
   you are strongly encouraged to stay with stable.

<p><em>Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?</em>
<p>A: The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security updates available
   as quickly and easily as possible. Mirrors would add extra complexity
   that is not needed and can cause frustration if they are not up to
   date.

<p><em>Q: How can I reach the security team?</em>
<p>A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org, which is read
   by all Debian developers. If you have sensitive information please
   use team@security.debian.org which only the members of the security
   team read. If desired email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
   Contact key (key ID 363CCD95).

<p><em>Q: How can I help with security?</em>
<p>A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
   security@debian.org.  If you are able to provide patches, that
   would speed up the process.  Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
   since they are received already.  Providing additional information,
   however, is always a good idea.

<p><em>Q: How is security handled in Debian?</em>
<p>A: Once the Security Team receives a notification of an incident,
   one or more members review it and consider Debian/stable vulnerable
   or not.  If our system is vulnerable, it is worked on a fix for the
   problem.  The package maintainer is contacted as well, if he didn't
   contact the Security Team already.  Finally the fix is tested and
   new packages are prepared, which then are compiled on all stable
   architectures and uploaded afterwards.  Now it's time for an advisory.

<p><em>Q: How is the Security Team composed?</em>
<p>A: The Debian Security Team currently consists of five members and
   two secretaries.  The Security Team itself appoints people to join
   the team.
