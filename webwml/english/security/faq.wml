<p>We receive the following questions a bit too often these days, so
their answers are summarized here.</p>

<p><em>Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!</em></p>
<p>A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
   <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
   debian-security-announce</a>
   list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
   from one of the security team members to be posted.</p>

<p>Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
   the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
   not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.</p>

<p>Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled) and
   formail (from procmail 3.14 only).</p>

<p><em>Q: How is security handled in Debian?</em></p>
<p>A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
   one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
   release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
   If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
   problem.  The package maintainer is contacted as well, if he didn't
   contact the security team already.  Finally, the fix is tested and
   new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
   architectures and uploaded afterwards.  After all of that is done,
   an advisory is published.</p>

<p><em>Q: What is the policy for a fixed package to appear in security.debian.org?</em>

<p>A: Security breakage in the stable distribution warrants a package
   on security.debian.org.  Anything else does not.  The size of a
   breakage is not the real problem here.  Usually the Security Team
   will prepare packages together with the package maintainer.
   Provided someone (trusted) tracks the problem and gets all the
   needed packages compiled and submit them to the Security Team, even
   very trivial security problem fixes will make it to
   security.debian.org.</p>

<p><em>Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
   a vulnerable version!</em>
<p>A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
   the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
   this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
   so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
   security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
   a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
   exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian 
   Security Advisory.</p>

<p><em>Q: How is security handled for <tt>testing</tt> and <tt>unstable</tt>?</em></p>
<p>A: The short answer is: it's not. Testing and unstable are rapidly moving
   targets and the security team does not have the resources needed to
   properly support those. If you want to have a secure (and stable) server
   you are strongly encouraged to stay with stable.</p>

<p><em>Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?</em></p>
<p>A: The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security updates available
   as quickly and easily as possible. Mirrors would add extra complexity
   that is not needed and can cause frustration if they are not up to
   date.</p>

<p><em>Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?</em></p>
<p>A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
   deriviates) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
   agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
   release an advisory at the same time.  This was decided in order to
   not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
   vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
   support several architectures or binary distributions).  Our own
   Security Team also prepares advisories in advance.  Every now and
   then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
   advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
   more advisories by number.

<p><em>Q: How can I reach the security team?</em></p>
<p>A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org, which is read
   by all Debian developers. If you have sensitive information please
   use team@security.debian.org which only the members of the security
   team read. If desired email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
   Contact key (key ID 363CCD95).</p>

<p><em>Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
   advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.</em></p>

<p>A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
   security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
   removed by the time the new one gets installed.  Hence, you'll get
   this `file not found' error.  We don't want to distribute packages
   with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
   distributed through the <a
   href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
   debian-security-announce</a> mailing list. It's best to simply run
   <code>apt-get update</code> before upgrading the package.</p>

<p><em>Q: How can I help with security?</em></p>
<p>A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
   security@debian.org.  If you are able to provide patches, that
   would speed up the process.  Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
   because we already receive them &mdash; but do provide us with
   additional information about things reported on bugtraq.</p>

<p><em>Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?</em>
<p>A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
   next revision of Debian stable.  Whenever packages are uploaded by
   a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
   proposed-updates directory.  Since stable is meant to be stable, no
   automatic updates are made.  The Security Team will upload fixed
   packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
   be placed in proposed-updates first.  Every couple of months the
   Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
   proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
   stable or not.  This is compiled into another revision of stable
   (e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4).

<p><em>Q: How is the security team composed?</em>
<p>A: The Debian security team currently consists of five officers and
   two secretaries.  The security team itself appoints people to join
   the team.
