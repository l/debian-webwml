<P>Debian takes security very seriously. Most security problems brought
to our attention are corrected within 48 hours.</P>

<P>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does not work. Public
disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems.  In
that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.</P>  

<P>Security bugs are only tracked until a version with the fix makes it into
the system.  If you find that the version number in the stable release is 
higher than the one shown in this area fixing the bug, then use the newer
version.

<P>For the latest Debian security information, subscribe to the <A
HREF="/MailingLists/subscribe">debian-security-announce </A>mailing list.  List
