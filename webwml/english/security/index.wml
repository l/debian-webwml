<p>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security problems
brought to our attention and are corrected within a reasonable timeframe.
Many advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors
and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public and
we also have a <a href="audit/">Security Audit</a> team that reviews
the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.</p>

# "reasonable timeframe" might be too vague, but we don't have 
# accurate statistics. For older (out of date) information and data
# please read:
# http://www.debian.org/News/2004/20040406  [ Year 2004 data ]
# and (older)
# http://people.debian.org/~jfs/debconf3/security/ [ Year 2003 data ]
# http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2001/12/msg00257.html [ Year 2001]
# If anyone wants to do up-to-date analysis please contact me (jfs)
# and I will provide scripts, data and database schemas.

<p>Experience has shown that <q>security through obscurity</q> does not work. Public
disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems.  In
that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.</p>  

<p>Debian also participates in security standardization efforts:
the <a href="#DSAS">Debian Security Advisories</a> are
<a href="cve-compatibility">CVE-Compatible</a> 
(review the <a href="crossreferences">cross references</a>)
and Debian is represented in the Board of the 
<a href="http://oval.mitre.org/">Open Vulnerability Assessment Language</a> project.

<h2>Keeping your Debian system secure</h2>

<p>In order to receive the latest Debian security advisories, subscribe to
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
debian-security-announce</a> mailing list.</p>

<p>You can use <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/admin/apt">apt</a>
to easily get the latest security updates.
This requires a line such as
</p>
<div class="centerblock">
<p>
<code>deb&nbsp;http://security.debian.org/&nbsp;<current_release_name>/updates&nbsp;main&nbsp;contrib&nbsp;non-free</code>
</p>
</div>
<p>
in your <CODE>/etc/apt/sources.list</CODE> file.
</p>

<p>For more information about security issues in Debian, please refer to
the <a href="faq">Security Team FAQ</a> and a manual called
<a href="../doc/user-manuals#securing">Securing Debian</a>.</p>

<h2><a name="DSAS">Recent Advisories</a></h2>

<p>These web pages include a condensed archive of security advisories posted to
the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/">\
debian-security-announce</a> list.

<p>The latest Debian security advisories are also available in
<a href="dsa">RDF format</a>. We also offer a
<a href="dsa-long">second file</a> that includes the first paragraph
of the corresponding advisory so you can see in it what the advisory is
about.</p>

<p>The older security advisories are also available:
<ul>
<:
 for ($year = $(CUR_YEAR); $year >= 1997; $year --)
 {
  print qq'  <li>Security advisories announced in <a href="$year/">$year</a></li>\n'
    if -d "$(ENGLISHDIR)/security/$year";
 }
:>
  <li><a href="undated/">Undated</a> security advisories, included for posterity.</li>
</ul>

<p>Debian distributions are not vulnerable to all security problems. The
<a href="http://security-tracker.debian.net/">Debian Security Tracker</a> 
collects all information about the vulnerability status of Debian packages,
and can be searched by CVE name or by package.</p>
