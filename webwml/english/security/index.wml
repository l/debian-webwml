<H1>Security Information</H1>

Debian takes security very seriously. Most security problems brought
to our attention are corrected within 48 hours.

<P>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does not work. Public disclosure allows for
more rapid and better solutions to security problems. In that vein, this page addresses
Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.  They are shown
roughly in reverse chronological order.
<P>
For the latest Debian security information, please check the <A HREF="http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-security-announce-9805/index.html">debian-security-announce</A> mailing list archives.

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Debian gives nicknames to each new release we are working on.
When a new version is ready, it is only then assigned a number. The current release
is the one pointed at by 'dists/stable' on the ftp archive. The development release is
the one pointed at by 'dists/unstable' on the ftp archive.
The nicknames are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>buzz - Debian 1.1
<LI>rex - Debian 1.2
<LI>bo - Debian 1.3 (current)
<LI>hamm - development release for 2.0
<LI>slink - development release for 2.1
</UL>
Also, there is an update directory for the current stable release. Security bugs are only
tracked until they make it into a stable update directory. If you find that the version
number in the stable release is higher than the one shown on this page fixing the bug,
then use the newer version.
