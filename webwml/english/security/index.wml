<H1>Security Information</H1>

<P>Debian takes security very seriously. Most security problems brought
to our attention are corrected within 48 hours.</P>

<P>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does not work. Public
disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems.  In
that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.</P>  

<P>For the latest Debian security information, please check subscribe to
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe">debian-security-announce
</A> mailing list.</P>

<P> Please send security-related bug reports to 
<A HREF="mailto:security@debian.org">security@debian.org</A></P>

<H3><CENTER>Please note, most security alerts in the last two months have not been placed on this section of the web.  This area is currently under overhaul and the information is not current.  For the lastest information, go to <http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/">the Lists Archives</A></CENTER></H3>

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Debian gives nicknames to each new release we are working on.
When a new version is ready, it is only then assigned a number. The current release
is the one pointed at by 'dists/stable' on the ftp archive. The development release is
the one pointed at by 'dists/unstable' on the ftp archive.
The nicknames are as follows:
<UL>
<LI>buzz - Debian 1.1
<LI>rex - Debian 1.2
<LI>bo - Debian 1.3
<LI>hamm - Debian 2.0 (current)
<LI>slink - development release for 2.1
</UL>
Also, there is an update directory for the current stable release. Security bugs are only
tracked until they make it into a stable update directory. If you find that the version
number in the stable release is higher than the one shown on this page fixing the bug,
then use the newer version.
