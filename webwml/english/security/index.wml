<P>Debian takes security very seriously. We handle all security problems
brought to our attention and are corrected within a reasonable timeframe.
Many advisories are coordinated with other free software vendors
and are published the same day a vulnerability is made public and
we also have a <a href="audit/">Security Audit</a> team that reviews
the archive looking for new or unfixed security bugs.</P>

# "reasonable timeframe" might be too vague, but we don't have 
# accurate statistics. For older (out of date) information and data
# please read:
# http://www.debian.org/News/2004/20040406  [ Year 2004 data ]
# and (older)
# http://people.debian.org/~jfs/debconf3/security/ [ Year 2003 data ]
# http://lists.debian.org/debian-security/2001/12/msg00257.html [ Year 2001]
# If anyone wants to do up-to-date analysis please contact me (jfs)
# and I will provide scripts, data and database schemas.

<P>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does not work. Public
disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems.  In
that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.</P>  

<P>Debian also participates in security standardization efforts:
the <a href="#DSAS">Debian Security Advisories</a> are
<a href="cve-compatibility">CVE-Compatible</a> 
(review the <a href="crossreferences">cross references</a>)
and Debian is represented in the Board of the 
<a href="http://oval.mitre.org/">Open Vulnerability Assessment Language</a> project.
</P>
