<P>Debian takes security very seriously. Most security problems brought
to our attention are corrected within 48 hours.</P>

<P>Experience has shown that "security through obscurity" does not work. Public
disclosure allows for more rapid and better solutions to security problems.  In
that vein, this page addresses Debian's status with respect to various known
security holes, which could potentially affect Debian.</P>
