#use wml::debian::template title="Key Rollover"

<p>
In <a href="$(HOME)/security/2008/dsa-1571">Debian Security Advisory 1571</a>, the Debian
Security Team disclosed a vulnerability in the OpenSSL package that makes
many cryptographic keys that are used for authentication (e.g. through SSH)
or signing (e.g. web server certificates) potentially vulnerable.
</p>

<p>
This page documents how to perform key rollover procedures for packages
whose keys are affected by the OpenSSL vulnerability.

Other software uses cryptographic keys, but is

<h1><a name="openssh">OpenSSH</a></h1>

<p>
A package has been released as <a href="$(HOME)/security/2008/dsa-1576">DSA-1576</a>, 
which eases key transformation.
</p>

<p>1. Install the security updates in DSA-1576</p>

   <p>Once the update is applied, weak user keys will be automatically
   rejected where possible (though they cannot be detected in all
   cases).  If you are using such keys for user authentication, they
   will immediately stop working and will need to be replaced (see
   step 3).</p>

   <p>OpenSSH host keys can be automatically regenerated when the OpenSSH
   security update is applied.  The update will prompt for confirmation
   before taking this step.</p>

<p>2. Update OpenSSH known_hosts files</p>

   <p>The regeneration of host keys will cause a warning to be displayed when
   connecting to the system using SSH until the host key is updated in the
   known_hosts file on the client.  The warning will look like this:</p>

<pre>
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
</pre>

   <p>In this case, the host key has simply been changed, and you should update
   the relevant known_hosts file as indicated in the error message.
   
   It is recommended that you use a trustworthy channel to exchange the
   server key.  It is found in the file /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub on
   the server; it's fingerprint can be printed using the command:</p>

      <p>ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub</p>

   <p>In addition to user-specific known_hosts files, there may be a
   system-wide file /etc/ssh/known_hosts.  This file is
   used both by the ssh client and by sshd for the hosts.equiv
   functionality.  This file needs to be updated as well.</p>

<p>3. Check all OpenSSH user keys</p>

   <p>The safest course of action is to regenerate all OpenSSH user keys,
   except where it can be established to a sufficient high degree of certainty that the
   key was generated on an unaffected system.</p>

   <p>Check whether your key is affected by running the ssh-vulnkey tool, included
   in the security update.  By default, ssh-vulnkey will check the standard
   location for user keys (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa and ~/.ssh/identity),
   your authorized_keys file (~/.ssh/authorized_keys and
   ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2), and the system's host keys
   (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_dsa_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key).</p>

   <p>To check all your own keys, assuming they are in the standard
   locations (~/.ssh/id_rsa, ~/.ssh/id_dsa, or ~/.ssh/identity):</p>

     <p>ssh-vulnkey</p>

   <p>To check all keys on your system:</p>

     <p>sudo ssh-vulnkey -a</p>

   <p>To check a key in a non-standard location:</p>

     <p>ssh-vulnkey /path/to/key</p>

   <p>If ssh-vulnkey says <q>Unknown (no blacklist information)</q>, then it has no
   information about whether that key is affected.  If in doubt, destroy the
   key and generate a new one.
   </p>

<p>4. Regenerate any affected user keys</p>

   <p>OpenSSH keys used for user authentication must be manually regenerated,
   including those which may have been transferred to a different system
   after being generated.</p>

   <p>New keys can be generated using ssh-keygen, e.g.:</p>

   <pre>
   $ ssh-keygen
   Generating public/private rsa key pair.
   Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
   Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
   Enter same passphrase again:
   Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
   Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
   The key fingerprint is:
   00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 user@host
   </pre>

<p>5. Update authorized_keys files (if necessary)</p>

   <p>Once the user keys have been regenerated, the relevant public keys
   must be propagated to any authorized_keys files (and authorized_keys2
   files, if applicable) on remote systems.  Be sure to delete the
   affected key.</p>

<h1><a name="gforge">gforge</a></h1>

<p>
The gforge-web-apache2 package in sid and lenny sets up the website
with a dummy certificate if no existing certificate is found. Users are then
encouraged to replace it with a "real" one. The dummy certificate in
question is the Snake Oil one, so it should already be known as a weak
one (even without the SSL bug), but some users may accept
it without a second thought. 
</p>

<h1><a name="kerberos">MIT Kerberos (krb5)</a></h1>

<p>
No part of MIT Kerberos in Debian 4.0 ("Etch") uses OpenSSL, and so Kerberos
in Debian 4.0 is not affected at all.
</p>

<p>
In Lenny the separate binary package krb5-pkinit uses OpenSSL.
<ul>
<li>
MIT Kerberos itself does not generate long-term key pairs even when the
PKINIT plugin is used, so any vulnerable long-term key pairs would have
been generated outside of the MIT Kerberos software itself.  The PKINIT
plugin only references existing key pairs and isn't responsible for key
management.
</li>
<li>
All of the random session key generation inside the PKINIT plugin is
done using the regular MIT Kerberos random key functions, <em>not</em> the
OpenSSL random number generator, and hence sessions created via PKINIT
are not subject to this vulnerability.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
MIT Kerberos itself is not in affected.  However, long-term key pairs used
with PKINIT may be affected if generated on an affected Debian system, but
such generation is external to MIT Kerberos.
</p>

<h1><a name="openswan">OpenSWAN / StrongSWAN</a></h1>

<pre>
rm /etc/ipsec.d/private/`hostname`Key.pem /etc/ipsec.d/certs/`hostname`Cert.pem
dpkg-reconfigure (open|strong)swan
/etc/init.d/ipsec restart
</pre>

<p>
Beware: Restarting the ipsec services terminates all currently open IPSec
connections, which may need to be restarted from the other end.
</p>

<h1><a name="xrdp">xrdp</a></h1>

<p>
xrdp uses generated keys. Most clients do not check those keys by
default, therefore changing them is painless. You just have to:
</p>

<pre>
rm /etc/xrdp/rsakeys.ini
/etc/init.d/xrdp restart
</pre>

<p>
xrdp is not in stable.
</p>
