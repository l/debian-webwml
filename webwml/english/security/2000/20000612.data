#use wml::debian::security

The Debian kernel source package currently in potato,
kernel-source-2.2.15-3, and binaries built from it, such as
kernel-image-2.2.15-2 (or more recent versions), are patched to prevent this
vulnerability. If you prefer to download kernel source from a mirror of
ftp.kernel.org instead of using the debian package, you should download 2.2.16
or better.
