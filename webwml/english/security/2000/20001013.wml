<define-tag moreinfo>
In versions of the traceroute package before 1.4a5-3, it is possible for a
local user to gain root access by exploiting an argument parsing error.

<p>This problem is fixed in version 1.4a5-3, uploaded to Debian's unstable
distribution on August 24, 2000.  Fixed packages are now also available in
proposed-updates and will be included in the next revision of Debian/2.2
(potato).

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) contains an earlier version of traceroute,
which is not affected by this problem.

<p>The traceroute-nanog package is unaffected by this problem.
