<define-tag moreinfo>mailx is often used by other programs to send email.
Unfortunately mailx as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) and Debian GNU/Linux
2.2 (potato) has some features that made it possible to execute system commands
if a user can trick a privileged program to send email using /usr/bin/mail.

<p>This has been fixed in version 8.1.1-10.1.1slink.2 (for Debian GNU/Linux 2.1) and
version 8.1.1-10.1.3 (for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2) by no longer allowing all configuration
options to be set using the environment.</define-tag>
