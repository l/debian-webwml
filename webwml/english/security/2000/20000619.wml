<define-tag moreinfo>Certain versions of xinetd have a bug in the access
control mechanism. If you use a hostname to control access to a service (
localhost instead of 127.0.0.1 ), xinetd will allow any connection from hosts
that fail a reverse look-up.

<p>The version of xinetd in debian 2.1 (slink) does not support the access
control mechanism and is <em>not</em> vulnerable to this problem. (Those
testing debian 2.2--potato--should upgrade to at least version
2.1.8.8.p3-1.)</define-tag>
