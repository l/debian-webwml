<define-tag moreinfo>\
The updated version of ntop (1.2a7-10) that was released on August 5
was found to still be insecure: It was still exploitable using buffer
overflows. Using this technique it was possible to run arbitrary code
as the user who ran ntop in web mode.

<P>In order to permanently fix these problems an updated package has
been released that disables web mode completely. The version of
this fix is 1.2a7-11.</P>
<P>We recommend you upgrade or remove your ntop package immediately.</P>
