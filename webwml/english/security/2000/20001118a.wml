<define-tag moreinfo>The version of Vixie Cron shipped with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.2 is vulnerable to a local attack, discovered by Michal
Zalewski.  Several problems, including insecure permissions on
temporary files and race conditions in their deletion, allowed attacks
from a denial of service (preventing the editing of crontabs) to an
escalation of privilege (when another user edited their crontab).

<p>As a temporary fix, &quot;chmod go-rx
/var/spool/cron/crontabs&quot; prevents the only available exploit;
however, it does not address the problem.  We recommend upgrading to
version 3.0pl1-57.1, for Debian 2.2, or 3.0pl1-61, for Debian
unstable.

<p>Also, in the new cron packages, it is no longer possible to specify
special files (devices, named pipes, etc.) by name to crontab.  Note
that this is not so much a security fix as a sanity
check.

<p>Note: Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 is vulnerable to this attack. We recommend
upgrading to Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato).
