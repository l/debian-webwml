<define-tag moreinfo>The version of nfs-common distributed in the
not-yet-released Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (a.k.a potato), as well as in the
unstable (woody) distribution, is vulnerable to a remote root compromise. No
exploit is known to exist in the wild, but the vulnerability has been verified.
Debian 2.1 (slink) did not include rpc.statd and is <em>not</em> vulnerable to
this exploit.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.1.9.1-1 of the nfs-common package. We
recommend that you update nfs-common immediately if you are running Debian
2.2.</define-tag>
