<define-tag moreinfo>The version of mtr as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
(aka slink) did not drop root privileges correctly. While there are no known
exploits it is conceivable that a weakness in gtk or ncurses could be used to
exploit this. This has been fixed in version 0.28-1, and we recommend that you
upgrade your mtr package.</define-tag>
