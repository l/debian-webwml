<define-tag moreinfo> The problem that was previously reported for joe has been
found in other editors. When nano (a free pico clone) unexpectedly dies it
tries a warning message to a new file with a predictable name (the name of the
file being edited with ".save" appended). Unfortunately that file was not
created safely which made nano vulnerable to a symlink attack. 
<p>This has been fixed in version 0.9.23-1 (except for powerpc, which has
version 0.9.23-1.1).</define-tag>
