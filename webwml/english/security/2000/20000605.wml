<define-tag moreinfo>The version of mailx distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
(a.k.a. slink), as well as in the frozen (potato) and unstable (woody)
distributions is vulnerable to a local buffer overflow while sending messages.
This could be exploited to give a shell running with group "mail".

This has been fixed in version 8.1.1-10.1, and we recommend that you update
your mailx package immediately.</define-tag>
