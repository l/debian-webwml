<define-tag moreinfo>There is a format string bug in all versions of
xlockmore/xlockmore-gl.  Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) installs xlock setgid by default,
and this exploit can be used to gain read access to the shadow file. We
recommend upgrading immediately.

<p>xlockmore is normally installed as an unprivileged program in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
(potato) and is not vulnerable in that configuration. xlockmore may be
setuid/setgid for historical reasons or after upgrading from a previous
Debian GNU/Linux release; consult README.Debian in /usr/doc/xlockmore or
/usr/doc/xlockmore-gl for information about xlock privileges and how to
disable them. If your local environment requires xlock to be setgid, or
if in doubt, you should upgrade to a fixed package immediately.

<p>Fixed packages are available in xlockmore/xlockmore-gl 4.12-5 for Debian GNU/Linux
2.1 (slink) and xlockmore/xlockmore-gl 4.15-9 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato).</define-tag>
