<define-tag moreinfo>imp as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 suffered from
insufficient checking of user supplied data: the IMP webmail interface did not
check the $from variable which contains the sender address for shell
metacharacters. This could be used to run arbitrary commands on the server
running imp.

<p>To fix this, horde (the library imp uses) has been modified to sanitize
$from, and imp has been patched to improve checking of user input. The updated
versions are horde 1.2.1-0 and imp 2.2.1-0, and we strongly recommend you
upgrade both packages immediately.</define-tag>
