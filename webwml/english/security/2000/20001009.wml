In versions of boa before 0.94.8.3, it is possible to access files outside
of the server's document root by the use of properly constructed URL
requests.

<p>This problem is fixed in version 0.94.8.3-1, uploaded to Debian's
unstable distribution on October 3, 2000.  Fixed packages are also available
in proposed-updates and will be included in the next revision of Debian/2.2
(potato).
