<define-tag moreinfo>The version of userv that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) had a problem in the fd swapping algorithm: it could
sometimes make an out-of-bounds array reference. It might be possible for local
users to abuse this to carry out unauthorised actions or be able to take
control for service user accounts.  

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.0.1.0slink for Debian GNU/Linux 2.1, and version
1.0.1.1potato for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2</define-tag>
