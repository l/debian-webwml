<define-tag moreinfo>The version of nvi that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 has an error in the default /etc/init.d/nviboot script: it did
not handle filenames with embedded spaces correctly. This made it possible to
remove files in the root directory by creating entries in /var/tmp/vi.recover.

This has been fixed in version 1.79-9.1 . We recommend you upgrade your nvi
package immediately.

If you use a customized version of nviboot please make sure your version
does not suffer from this problem. If you upgrade dpkg will offer to replace
it with the new safe version if needed.</define-tag>
