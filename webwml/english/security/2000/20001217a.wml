<define-tag moreinfo>Michel Kaempf reported a security problem in slocate (a
secure version of locate, a tool to quickly locate files on a filesystem) on
bugtraq which was originally discovered by zorgon. He discovered there was a
bug in the database reading code which made it overwrite a internal structure
with some input. He then showed this could be exploited to trick slocate into
executing arbitrary code by pointing it to a carefully crafted database.
<p>This has been fixed in version 2.4-2potato1 and we recommend that you
upgrade your slocate package immediately.</define-tag>
