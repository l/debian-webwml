<define-tag moreinfo>The adv.fwd security advisory from OpenBSD
reported a problem with openssh that Jacob Langseth &lt;jwl@pobox.com&gt;
found: when the connection is established the remote ssh server can
force the ssh client to enable agent and X11 forwarding.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.2.3-9.1 and we recommend that you
upgrade your openssh packages immediately.</define-tag>
