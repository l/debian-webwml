<define-tag moreinfo>On versions of Zope prior to 2.2.1 it was possible for a
user with the ability to edit DTML to gain unauthorized access to extra roles
during a request. A fix was previously announced in the Debian GNU/Linux zope package
2.1.6-5.1, but that package did not fully address the issue and has been
superseded by this announcement. More information is available at <a
href=http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/Hotfix_2000-08-17/security_alert>http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/Hotfix_2000-08-17/security_alert</a>.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) did not include zope, and <em>is not</em> vulnerable.
Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) does include zope and <em>is</em> vulnerable to this issue.
A fixed package for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) is available in zope
2.1.6-5.2.</define-tag>
