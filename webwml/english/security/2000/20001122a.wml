<define-tag moreinfo>hacksware reported a buffer overflow in the AFS packet
parsing code in ethereal. Gerald Combs then found more overflows in the netbios
and ntp decoding logic as well. An attacker can exploit those overflows by
sending carefully crafted packets to a network that is being monitored by
ethereal.  This has been fixed in version 0.8.0-2potato and we recommend you
upgrade your ethereal package immediately.</define-tag>
