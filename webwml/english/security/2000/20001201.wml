<define-tag moreinfo>The security fix for joe released on November 22, 2000 had
a problem: it created the DEADJOE file securely but didn't write anything to
it. This has been fixed in version 2.8-15.2.

<p>
This is the text from the previous advisory: 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When joe (Joe's Own
Editor) dies due to a signal instead of a normal exit it saves a list of the
files it is editing to a file called `DEADJOE' in its current directory.
Unfortunately this wasn't done safely which made joe vulnerable to a symlink
attack.
