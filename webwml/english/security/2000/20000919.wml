<define-tag moreinfo> Multiple vulnerabilities have been reported in syslogd
and klogd. A local root exploit is possible, and remote exploits may be
possible in some cases (though we are not currently aware of a remote exploit.)

<p>Fixed packages are available in version 1.3-31.slink1 for Debian 2.1
(slink) and version 1.3-33.1 for Debian 2.2 (potato). We recommend
upgrading your sysklogd package immediately.</define-tag>
