There is a widely-reported problem with the handling of POSIX capabilities
in the Linux kernel that can lead to root compromise in setuid applications.
This bug does <em>not</em> affect kernels in the 2.0 or earlier series; the
2.0 kernels installed by default in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) are
<em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are running a kernel with a version of
2.1.*, 2.2.*, or 2.3.*, you should upgrade immediately.

<p>The Debian kernel source package currently in potato,
kernel-source-2.2.15-3, and binaries built from it, such as
kernel-image-2.2.15-2 (or more recent versions), are patched to prevent this
vulnerability. If you prefer to download kernel source from a mirror of
ftp.kernel.org instead of using the debian package, you should download
2.2.16 or better.
