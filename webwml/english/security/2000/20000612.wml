<define-tag moreinfo>There is a widely-reported problem with the handling of
POSIX capabilities in the linux kernel that can lead to root compromise in
setuid applications. This bug does <em>not</em> affect kernels in the 2.0 or
earlier series; the 2.0 kernels installed by default in debian 2.1 (slink) are
<em>not</em> vulnerable. If you are running a kernel with a version of 2.1.*,
2.2.*, or 2.3.*, you should upgrade immediately.</define-tag>

#use wml::debian::security

<dd>Debian kernel packages kernel-image-2.2.15-2 and kernel-source-2.2.15-3 (or
more recent versions) are patched to prevent this vulnerability.
Alternatively, you can install a 2.2.16 kernel from a kernel mirror.
