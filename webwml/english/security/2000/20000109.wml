<define-tag moreinfo>The version of lpr that was distributed with Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 and the updated version released in 2.1r4 have a two security
problems:

<ul>
<li>the client hostname wasn't verified properly, so if someone is able to
control the DNS entry for their IP they could fool lpr into granting access.
<li>it was possible to specify extra options to sendmail which could be used to
specify another configuration file. This can be used to gain root access.
</ul>

Both problems have been fixed in 0.48-0.slink1. We recommend you upgrade
your lpr package immediately.
