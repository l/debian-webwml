<define-tag moreinfo>
The Debian GNU/Linux xmcd package has historically installed two setuid
helpers for accessing cddb databases and SCSI cdrom drives.  More recently,
the package offered the administrator the chance to remove these setuid
flags, but did so incorrectly.

<p>A buffer overflow in ncurses, linked to the "cda" binary, allowed a root
exploit.  Fixed ncurses packages have been released, as well as fixed
xmcd packages which do not install this binary with a setuid flag.

<p>The problem is fixed in xmcd 2.5pl1-7.1, and we recommend all users with
xmcd installed upgrade to this release.  You may need to add users of xmcd
to the "audio" and "cdrom" groups in order for them to continue using xmcd.
