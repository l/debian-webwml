<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of BIND shipped with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 is vulnerable to
a remote denial of service attack, which can cause the nameserver to crash
after accessing an uninitialized pointer.  This problem is fixed in the current
maintenance release of BIND, 8.2.2P7, and in the Debian package version
8.2.2p7-1 for both stable and unstable releases.

<p>We recommend that all users of BIND upgrade immediately.
