<define-tag moreinfo>\
The version of X-Chat that was distributed with Debian GNU/Linux 2.2
has a vulnerability in the URL handling code: When a user clicks on
a URL X-Chat will start netscape to view its target. However it
did not check the URL for shell metacharacters, and this could be
abused to trick xchat into executing arbitrary commands.

<P>This has been fixed in version 1.4.3-0.1, and we recommend you
upgrade your xchat package(s) immediately.</P>

<P>Update: The powerpc packages mentioned in the first release of this
advisory were linked with a version of libgtk that is not available
in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2. They have been recompiled with the correct
version and re-uploaded.</P>
