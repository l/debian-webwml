In versions of the PHP 3 packages before version 3.0.17, several format
string bugs could allow properly crafted requests to execute code as the
user running PHP scripts on the web server, particularly if error logging
was enabled.

<p>This problem is fixed in versions 3.0.17-0potato2 and 3.0.17-0potato3 for
Debian 2.2 (potato) and in version 3.0.17-1 for Debian Unstable (woody).
This is a bug fix release and we recommend all users of php3 upgrade to it.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink) contains php3 version 3.0.5, which is
believed to be affected by this problem.  No security updates for slink are
available at this time; Slink users who have php3 installed are highly
recommended to either upgrade to potato or recompile the potato php3
packages from source (see the URLs below).
