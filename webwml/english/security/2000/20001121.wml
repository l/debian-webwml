<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of the ncurses display library shipped with Debian GNU/Linux
2.2 is vulnerable to several buffer overflows in the parsing of terminfo
database files.  This problem was discovered by Jouko Pynn√∂nen
&lt;jouko@solutions.fi&gt;. The problems are only exploitable in the
presence of setuid binaries linked to ncurses which use these particular
functions, including xmcd versions before 2.5pl1-7.1.

<p>This problem is fixed in ncurses 5.0-6.0potato1 for Debian GNU/Linux 2.2,
and in ncurses 5.0-8 for Debian Unstable.
