<define-tag moreinfo>The make package as shipped in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 is
vulnerable to a race condition that can be exploited with a symlink attack.
make used mktemp while creating temporary files in /tmp -- a known
potential security hole, as documented in the man page of mktemp.

This has been fixed in version 3.77-5slink. We recommend you upgrade your make
package immediately.</define-tag>
