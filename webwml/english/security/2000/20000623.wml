<define-tag moreinfo>The version of wu-ftpd distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
(a.k.a. slink), as well as in the frozen (potato) and unstable (woody)
distributions, is vulnerable to a remote root compromise.  The default
configuration in all current Debian packages prevents the currently available
exploits in the case of anonymous access, although local users could still
possibly compromise the server.

<p>This has been fixed in versions 2.4.2.16-13.1 (for slink) and 2.6.0-5.1 (for
potato and woody), and we recommend that you update your wu-ftpd-academ (for
slink) or wu-ftpd (for potato and woody) package immediately.
