<define-tag moreinfo>The versions of the ISC DHCP client in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 (slink)
and Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 (potato) are vulnerable to a root exploit. The OpenBSD team
reports that the client inappropriately executes commands embedded in replies
sent from a dhcp server. This means that a malicious dhcp server can execute
commands on the client with root privileges. A previous Debian security
advisory addressed this issue with package versions 2.0b1pl6-0.3 and
2.0-3potato1, but ISC has released a newer patch since the original advisory.
You should install the latest packages even if you upgraded when the last
advisory was released.

<p>The reported vulnerability is fixed in the package dhcp-client-beta
2.0b1pl6-0.4 for the current stable release (Debian GNU/Linux 2.1) and in dhcp-client
2.0-3potato2 for the frozen pre-release (Debian GNU/Linux 2.2). The dhcp server and relay
agents are built from the same source as the client; however, the server and
relay agents are not vulnerable to this issue and do not need to be upgraded.
We recommend upgrading your dhcp-client-beta and dhcp-client immediately.</define-tag>
