<define-tag moreinfo>The apcd package as shipped in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1 is
vulnerable to a symlink attack. If the apcd process gets a SIGUSR1 signal it
will dump its status to /tmp/upsstat. However this file is not opened safely,
which makes it a good target for a symlink attack.

<p>This has been fixed in version 0.6a.nr-4slink1. We recommend you upgrade
your apcd package immediately.</define-tag>
