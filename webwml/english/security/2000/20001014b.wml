In versions of the PHP 4 packages before version 4.0.3, several format
string bugs could allow properly crafted requests to execute code as the
user running PHP scripts on the web server.

<p>This problem is fixed in versions 4.0.3-0potato1 for Debian 2.2 (potato)
and 4.0.3-1 for Debian Unstable (woody).  This is a bug fix release and we
recommend all users of php4 upgrade to it; potato users should note that
this is an upgrade from 4.0b3, but no incompatibilities are expected.
