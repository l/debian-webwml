<define-tag moreinfo>The canna package as distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
can be remotely exploited to gain access. This could be done by overflowing a
buffer by sending a SR_INIT command with a very long username or groupname.

<p>This has been fixed in version 3.5b2-24slink1, and we recommend that you upgrade
your canna package immediately. </define-tag>
