<define-tag moreinfo>When joe (Joe's Own Editor) dies due to a signal instead
of a normal exit it saves a list of the files it is editing to a file called
`DEADJOE' in its current directory. Unfortunately this wasn't done safely which
made joe vulnerable to a symlink attack. This has been fixed in version
2.8-15.1.</define-tag>
