<define-tag moreinfo>Mandrake has recently released a security advisory against
CUPS raising two issues: 

<ol>
<li>CUPS sends broadcast packets, which can keep dial-on-demand lines up and
otherwise irritate network administrators. 
<li>CUPS has a rather vague problem to the effect of "everyone on the Internet
can get to your printers". 
</ol>
 
<p>The first problem is not a problem either in Debian's potato (2.2) or woody
(unstable). Our cupsys packages are shipped with browsing turned off by
default.  

<p>The second problem has to do with CUPS's configuration. CUPS does access
control in a similar way to Apache, and is configured by default in a similar
way to Apache. This isn't terribly appropriate in the case of allowing people
to attach to printers. Administrative tasks still aren't allowed, but Internet
users could (for example) run all the paper out of your printer. Debian as
shipped in potato and woody is vulnerable to this latter problem.  

<p>The fix is simply to configure access control to reflect your real wishes,
which is done in /etc/cups/cupsd.conf. This can be done with the current
packages (in both potato and woody).  

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.0.4-8 (or 1.1.4-2 for unstable) and we
recommend that you upgrade your cupsys packages immediately. </define-tag>
