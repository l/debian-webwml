<define-tag moreinfo>Two bugs in GnuPG have recently been found:

<ol>
<li>false positives when verifying detached signatures

<p>There is a problem in the way gpg checks detached signatures which
can lead to false positives. Detached signature can be verified with a
command like this: <code>gpg --verify detached.sig &lt; mydata</code>

<p>If someone replaced detached.sig with a signed text (ie not a
detached signature) and then modified mydata gpg would still report a
successfully verified signature.

<p>To fix this, the way the --verify option works has been changed: It now
needs two options when verifying detached signatures: Both the file with the
detached signature, and the file with the data to be verified. Please note
that this makes it incompatible with older versions!

<li>secret keys are silently imported

<p>Florian Weimer discovered that gpg would import secret keys from
key-servers. Since gpg considers public keys corresponding to known secret
keys to be ultimately trusted an attacker can use this to circumvent the web of
trust.

<p>To fix this a new option was added to tell gpg it is allowed to import
secret keys: --allow-key-import.
