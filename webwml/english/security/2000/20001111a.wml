Proton reported on bugtraq that tcsh did not handle in-here documents
correctly. The version of tcsh that is distributed with Debian GNU/Linux
2.2r0 also suffered from this problem.

When using in-here documents using the &lt;&lt; syntax tcsh uses a temporary
file to store the data. Unfortunately the temporary file is not created
securely and standard symlink attacks can be used to make tcsh overwrite
arbitrary files.

This has been fixed in version 6.09.00-10 and we recommend that you
upgrade your tcsh package immediately.
