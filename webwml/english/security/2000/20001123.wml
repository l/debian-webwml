<define-tag moreinfo>
ghostscript uses temporary files, however the method used to create those
files wasn't secure: mktemp was used to create a name for a temporary file,
but the file was not opened safely. Another problem is that during build,
the LD_RUN_PATH environment variable was set to the empty string, which
causes the dynamic linker to look in the current directory for shared
libraries.

<p>Both of these problems have been fixed in version 5.10-10.1.
