<define-tag moreinfo>The versions of cvsweb distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.1
(aka slink) as well as in the frozen (potato) and unstable (woody)
distributions, are vulnerable to a remote shell exploit. An attacker with write
access to the cvs repository can execute arbitrary code on the server, as the
www-data user. 

<p>The vulnerability is fixed in version 109 of cvsweb for the
current stable release (Debian GNU/Linux 2.1), in version 1.79-3potato1 for the frozen
distribution, and in version 1.86-1 for the unstable distribution.</define-tag>
