<define-tag moreinfo>
The version of gnupg that was distributed in Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 had
a logic error in the code that checks for valid signatures which could
cause false positive results: Jim Small discovered that if the input
contained multiple signed sections the exit-code gnupg returned was
only valid for the last section, so improperly signed other sections
were not noticed.

<p>This has been fixed in version 1.0.4-1 and we recommend that you upgrade
your gnupg package to that version. Please note that this version of gnupg
includes the RSA code directly instead of relying on the gpg-rsa package.
This means that the <code>"load-extension rsa"</code> command in
<code>~/.gnupg/options</code> is no longer needed and must be removed: gnupg
will not work correctly if it tries to load an extension that is not
present.
