<define-tag moreinfo>The versions of the ISC DHCP client in debian 2.1 (slink)
and debian 2.2 (potato) are vulnerable to a root exploit. The OpenBSD team
reports that the client inappropriately executes commands embedded in replies
sent from a dhcp server. This means that a malicious dhcp server can execute
commands on the client with root privilages.</define-tag>
