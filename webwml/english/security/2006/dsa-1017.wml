<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>

<p>This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well. Due to the change in the package
name you need to use <tt>apt-get dist-upgrade</tt> to update your system.</p>
