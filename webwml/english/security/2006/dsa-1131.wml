<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mark Dowd discovered a buffer overflow in the mod_rewrite component of
apache, a versatile high-performance HTTP server.  In some situations a
remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in version 1.3.33-6sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problems will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache package.</p>
