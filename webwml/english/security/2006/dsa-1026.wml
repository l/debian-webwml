<p>Markus Oberhumer discovered a flaw in the way zlib, a library used for
file compression and decompression, handles invalid input. This flaw can
cause programs which use zlib to crash when opening an invalid file.
A further error in the way zlib handles the inflation of certain
compressed files can cause a program which uses zlib to crash when opening
an invalid file.</p>

<p>sash, the stand-alone shell, links statically against zlib, and was
thus affected by these problems.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7-5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sash package.</p>
