<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The xmcdconfig creates directories world-writeable allowing local
users to fill the /usr and /var partition and hence cause a denial of
service.  This problem has been half-fixed since version 2.3-1.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-14woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-17sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.6-18.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xmcd package.</p>
