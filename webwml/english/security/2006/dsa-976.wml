<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Johnny Mast discovered a buffer overflow in libast, the library of
assorted spiffy things, that can lead to the execution of arbitary
code.  This library is used by eterm which is installed setgid uid
which leads to a vulnerability to alter the utmp file.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4-3woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6-0pre2003010606sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libast packages.</p>
