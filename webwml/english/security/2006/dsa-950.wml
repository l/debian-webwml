<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in CUPS, the Common UNIX
Printing System, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing
the application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.14-5woody14.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.1.23-10sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your CUPS packages.</p>
