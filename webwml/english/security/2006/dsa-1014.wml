<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Aviram Jenik and Damyan Ivanov discovered a buffer overflow in
firebird2, an RDBMS based on InterBase 6.0 code, that allows remote
attackers to crash.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain firebird2 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.1-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.3.4870-3</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your firebird2 packages.</p>
