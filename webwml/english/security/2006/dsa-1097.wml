<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0038">CVE-2006-0038</a>

    <p>"Solar Designer" discovered that arithmetic computations in netfilter's
    do_replace() function can lead to a buffer overflow and the execution of
    arbitrary code. However, the operation requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges,
    which is only an issue in virtualization systems or fine grained access
    control systems.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0039">CVE-2006-0039</a>

    <p>"Solar Designer" discovered a race condition in netfilter's
    do_add_counters() function, which allows information disclosure of
    kernel memory by exploiting a race condition. Like <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0038">CVE-2006-0038</a>,
    it requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0741">CVE-2006-0741</a>

    <p>Intel EM64T systems were discovered to be susceptible to a local
    DoS due to an endless recursive fault related to a bad ELF entry
    address.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0742">CVE-2006-0742</a>

    <p>incorrectly declared die_if_kernel() function as "does never
    return" which could be exploited by a local attacker resulting in
    a kernel crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1056">CVE-2006-1056</a>

    <p>AMD64 machines (and other 7th and 8th generation AuthenticAMD
    processors) were found to be vulnerable to sensitive information
    leakage, due to how they handle saving and restoring the FOP, FIP,
    and FDP x87 registers in FXSAVE/FXRSTOR when an exception is
    pending. This allows a process to determine portions of the state
    of floating point instructions of other processes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1242">CVE-2006-1242</a>

    <p>Marco Ivaldi discovered that there was an unintended information
    disclosure allowing remote attackers to bypass protections against
    Idle Scans (nmap -sI) by abusing the ID field of IP packets and
    bypassing the zero IP ID in DF packet countermeasure. This was a
    result of the ip_push_pending_frames function improperly
    incremented the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving
    unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1343">CVE-2006-1343</a>

    <p>Pavel Kankovsky reported the existance of a potential information leak
    resulting from the failure to initialize sin.sin_zero in the IPv4 socket
    code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1368">CVE-2006-1368</a>

    <p>Shaun Tancheff discovered a buffer overflow (boundry condition
    error) in the USB Gadget RNDIS implementation allowing remote
    attackers to cause a DoS. While creating a reply message, the
    driver allocated memory for the reply data, but not for the reply
    structure. The kernel fails to properly bounds-check user-supplied
    data before copying it to an insufficiently sized memory
    buffer. Attackers could crash the system, or possibly execute
    arbitrary machine code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1524">CVE-2006-1524</a>

    <p>Hugh Dickins discovered an issue in the madvise_remove() function wherein
    file and mmap restrictions are not followed, allowing local users to
    bypass IPC permissions and replace portions of readonly tmpfs files with
    zeroes.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1525">CVE-2006-1525</a>

    <p>Alexandra Kossovsky reported a NULL pointer dereference condition in
    ip_route_input() that can be triggered by a local user by requesting
    a route for a multicast IP address, resulting in a denial of service
    (panic).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1857">CVE-2006-1857</a>

    <p>Vlad Yasevich reported a data validation issue in the SCTP subsystem
    that may allow a remote user to overflow a buffer using a badly formatted
    HB-ACK chunk, resulting in a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1858">CVE-2006-1858</a>

    <p>Vlad Yasevich reported a bug in the bounds checking code in the SCTP
    subsystem that may allow a remote attacker to trigger a denial of service
    attack when rounded parameter lengths are used to calculate parameter
    lengths instead of the actual values.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1864">CVE-2006-1864</a>

    <p>Mark Mosely discovered that chroots residing on an SMB share can be
    escaped with specially crafted "cd" sequences.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2271">CVE-2006-2271</a>

    <p>The "Mu security team" discovered that carefully crafted ECNE chunks can
    cause a kernel crash by accessing incorrect state stable entries in the
    SCTP networking subsystem, which allows denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2272">CVE-2006-2272</a>

    <p>The "Mu security team" discovered that fragmented SCTP control
    chunks can trigger kernel panics, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2274">CVE-2006-2274</a>

    <p>It was discovered that SCTP packets with two initial bundled data
    packets can lead to infinite recursion, which allows for denial of
    service attacks.</p>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
