<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Josh Berkus and Tom Lane discovered that MySQL 4.1, a popular SQL
database, incorrectly parses astring escaped with mysql_real_escape()
which could lead to SQL injection.  This problem does only exist in
versions 4.1 and 5.0.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.11a-4sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.0.21-4.</p>

<p>Version 4.0 in the stable distribution (sarge) is also not affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql packages.</p>
