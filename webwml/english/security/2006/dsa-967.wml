<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security problems have been found in elog, an electronic logbook
to manage notes.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4439">CVE-2005-4439</a>

    <p>"GroundZero Security" discovered that elog insufficiently checks the
    size of a buffer used for processing URL parameters, which might lead
    to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0347">CVE-2006-0347</a>

    <p>It was discovered that elog contains a directory traversal vulnerability
    in the processing of "../" sequences in URLs, which might lead to
    information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0348">CVE-2006-0348</a>

    <p>The code to write the log file contained a format string vulnerability,
    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0597">CVE-2006-0597</a>

    <p>Overly long revision attributes might trigger a crash due to a buffer
    overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0598">CVE-2006-0598</a>

    <p>The code to write the log file does not enforce bounds checks properly,
    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0599">CVE-2006-0599</a>

    <p>elog emitted different errors messages for invalid passwords and invalid
    users, which allows an attacker to probe for valid user names.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0600">CVE-2006-0600</a>

    <p>An attacker could be driven into infinite redirection with a crafted
    "fail" request, which has denial of service potential.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain elog packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.1+r1642-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your elog package.</p>
