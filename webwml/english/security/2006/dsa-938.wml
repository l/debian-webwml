<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in koffice, the KDE Office Suite, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain koffice packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4.sarge.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your koffice package.</p>
