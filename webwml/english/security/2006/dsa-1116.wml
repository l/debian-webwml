<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Henning Makholm discovered a buffer overflow in the XCF loading code
of Gimp, an image editing program. Opening a specially crafted XCF
image might cause the application to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.6-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.11-3.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gimp package.</p>
