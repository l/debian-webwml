<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A potential denial of service problem has been discovered in mailman,
the web-based GNU mailing list manager.  The (failing) parsing of
messages with malformed mime multiparts sometimes caused the whole
mailing list to become inoperative.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not vulnerable to this issue.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.5-8sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mailman package.</p>
