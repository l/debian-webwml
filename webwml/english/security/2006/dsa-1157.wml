<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the
Ruby language, which may lead to the bypass of security restrictions or
denial of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1931">CVE-2006-1931</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the use of blocking sockets can lead to denial
    of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3964">CVE-2006-3964</a>

    <p>It was discovered that Ruby does not properly maintain "safe levels"
    for aliasing, directory accesses and regular expressions, which might
    lead to a bypass of security restrictions.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2-7sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.4-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Ruby packages.</p>
