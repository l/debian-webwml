<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
flyspray, a lightweight bug tracking system, which allows attackers to
insert arbitrary script code into the index page.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain flyspray.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7-2.1.</p>

<p>For the testing (etch) and unstable distribution (sid) this problem has
been fixed in version 0.9.8-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flyspray package.</p>
