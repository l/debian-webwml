<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered a buffer overflow in the processing of ASF
files in libextractor, a library to extract arbitrary meta-data from
files., which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.14-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor packages.</p>
