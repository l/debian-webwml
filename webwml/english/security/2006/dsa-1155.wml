<p>It turned out that the sendmail binary depends on libsasl2 (>= 2.1.19.dfsg1)
which is neither available in the stable nor in the security archive.
This version is scheduled for the inclusion in the next update of the
stable release, though.</p>

<p>You'll have to download the referenced file for your architecture from
below and install it with <kbd>dpkg -i<kbd>.</p>

<p>As an alternative, temporarily adding the following line to
/etc/apt/sources.list will mitigate the problem as well:</p>

<code>
  deb http://ftp.debian.de/debian stable-proposed-updates main
</code>

<p>Here is the original security advisory for completeness:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Frank Sheiness discovered that a MIME conversion routine in sendmail,
a powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent, could be
tricked by a specially crafted mail to perform an endless recursion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.4-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.7-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sendmail package.</p>
