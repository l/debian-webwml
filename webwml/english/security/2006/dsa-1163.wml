<p>Michael Gehring discovered several potential out-of-bounds index
accesses in gtetrinet, a multiplayer Tetris-like game, which may allow
a remote server to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.7.8-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gtetrinet package.</p>
