<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in elog, a web-based
electronic logbook, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.5.7+r1558-4+sarge3.</p>

<p>The upcoming stable distribution (etch) will no longer include elog.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.6.2+r1754-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your elog package.</p>
