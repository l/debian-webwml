<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered several buffer overflows in alsaplayer, a
PCM player designed for ALSA, that can lead to a crash of the
application and maybe worse outcome.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.76-0.3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your alsaplayer package.</p>
