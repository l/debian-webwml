<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered that the flexbackup backup tool creates temporary
files in an insecure manner, which allows denial of service through a
symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-2sarge1</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.2.1-3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flexbackup package.</p>
