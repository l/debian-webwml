<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Harnhammar from the Debian Security Audit project discovered a
format string attack in the logging code of smstools, which may be
exploited to execute arbitary code with root privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain smstools package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14.8-1sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution the package will be updated shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your smstools package.</p>
