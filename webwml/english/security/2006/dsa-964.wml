<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A problem has been discovered in gnocatan, the computer version of the
settlers of Catan boardgame, that can lead the server and other clients
to exit via an assert, and hence does not permit the execution of
arbitrary code.  The game has been renamed into Pioneers after the
release of Debian sarge.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.1-5woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1.59-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.49-1 of pioneers.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnocatan and pioneers packages.</p>
