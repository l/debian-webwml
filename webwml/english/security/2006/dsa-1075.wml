<p>Hendrik Weimer discovered that awstats can execute arbitrary commands
under the user id the web-server runs when users are allowed to supply
arbitrary configuration files.  Even though, this bug was referenced
in DSA 1058 accidentally, it was not fixed yet.</p>

<p>The new default behaviour is not to accept arbitrary configuration
directories from the user.  This can be overwritten by the
AWSTATS_ENABLE_CONFIG_DIR environment variable when users are to be
trusted.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your awstats package.</p>
