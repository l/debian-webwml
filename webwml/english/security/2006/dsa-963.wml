<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>NISCC reported that MyDNS, a DNS server using an SQL database for data
storage, can be tricked into an infinite loop by a remote attacker and
hence cause a denial of service condition.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain mydns packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.0-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0+pre-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mydns package.</p>
