<p>Tavis Ormandy noticed that gnupg, the GNU privacy guard - a free PGP
replacement, can be tricked to emit a "good signature" status message
when a valid signature is included which does not belong to the data
packet.  This update basically adds fixed packages for woody whose
version turned out to be vulnerable as well.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-4woody5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.2.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg package.</p>
