<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Neil McBride discovered that Zoph, a web based photo management system
performs insufficient sanitising for input passed to photo searches, which
may lead to the execution of SQL commands through a SQL injection attack.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain zoph packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.3-12sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zoph package.</p>
