<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in libextractor, a library to extract arbitrary meta-data
from files, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing the
application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain libextractor
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor packages.</p>
