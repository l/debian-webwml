<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered a buffer overflow in the loading component
of cheesetracker, a sound module tracking program, which could allow a
maliciously constructed input file to execute arbitary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.9-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.9-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cheesetracker package.</p>
