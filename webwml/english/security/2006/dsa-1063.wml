<p>It was discovered that the Avatar upload feature of FUD Forum, a component
of the web based groupware system phpgroupware, does not sufficiently
validate uploaded files, which might lead to the execution of injected web
script code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.14-0.RC3.2.woody6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.16.005-3.sarge5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.16.009-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpgroupware packages.</p>
