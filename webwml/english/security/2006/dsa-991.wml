<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jean-Sébastien Guay-Leroux discovered a buffer overflow in zoo, a
utility to manipulate zoo archives, that could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code when unpacking a specially crafted zoo archive.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10-9woody0.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10-11sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10-17.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zoo package.</p>
