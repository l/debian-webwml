<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in PHP, a
server-side, HTML-embedded scripting language, which may lead to the
execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3353">CVE-2005-3353</a>

    <p>Tim Starling discovered that missing input sanitising in the EXIF
    module could lead to denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3017">CVE-2006-3017</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered a security-critical programming error in the
    hashtable implementation of the internal Zend engine.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4482">CVE-2006-4482</a>

    <p>It was discovered that str_repeat() and wordwrap() functions perform
    insufficient checks for buffer boundaries on 64 bit systems, which
    might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5465">CVE-2006-5465</a>

    <p>Stefan Esser discovered a buffer overflow in the htmlspecialchars()
    and htmlentities(), which might lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.3.10-18. Builds for hppa and m68k will be provided later
once they are available.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4:4.4.4-4 of php4 and version 5.1.6-6 of php5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your php4 packages.</p>
