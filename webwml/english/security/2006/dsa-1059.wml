<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Konstantin Gavrilenko discovered several vulnerabilities in quagga,
the BGP/OSPF/RIP routing daemon.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2223">CVE-2006-2223</a>

    <p>Remote attackers may obtain sensitive information via RIPv1
    REQUEST packets even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5
    authentication.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2224">CVE-2006-2224</a>

    <p>Remote attackers could inject arbitrary routes using the RIPv1
    RESPONSE packet even if the quagga has been configured to use MD5
    authentication.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2276">CVE-2006-2276</a>

    <p>Fredrik Widell discovered that local users can cause a denial
    of service in a certain sh ip bgp command entered in the telnet
    interface.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain quagga packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.98.3-7.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your quagga package.</p>
