<p>Erik Sjölund discovered that abc2ps, a translator for ABC music
description files into PostScript, does not check the boundaries when
reading in ABC music files resulting in buffer overflows.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.3-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.3-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.3-3sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your abc2ps package.</p>
