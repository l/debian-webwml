<p>Ludwig Nussel discovered that kdm, the X display manager for KDE, handles
access to the session type configuration file insecurely, which may lead
to the disclosure of arbitrary files through a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdm package.</p>
