<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in pdftohtml, a utility that
translates PDF documents into HTML format, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdftohtml packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.36-11sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdftohtml package.</p>
