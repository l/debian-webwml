<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andrea Barisani discovered that xzgv, a picture viewer for X with a
thumbnail-based selector, attempts to decode JPEG images within the
CMYK/YCCK colour space incorrectly, which could lead to the execution
of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.7-6woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xzgv package.</p>
