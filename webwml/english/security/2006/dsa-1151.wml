<p>Yan Rong Ge discovered out-of-boundary memory access in heartbeat, the
subsystem for High-Availability Linux.  This could be used by a remote
attacker to cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-9sarge6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.4-14 and heartbeat-2 2.0.6-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heartbeat packages.</p>
