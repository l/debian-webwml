<p>Several encoding problems have been discovered in PostgreSQL, a
popular SQL database.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2313">CVE-2006-2313</a>

    <p>Akio Ishida and Yasuo Ohgaki discovered a weakness in the handling
    of invalidly-encoded multibyte text data which could allow an
    attacker to inject arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2314">CVE-2006-2314</a>

    <p>A similar problem exists in client-side encodings (such as SJIS,
    BIG5, GBK, GB18030, and UHC) which contain valid multibyte
    characters that end with the backslash character.  An attacker
    could supply a specially crafted byte sequence that is able to
    inject arbitrary SQL commands.</p>

    <p>This issue does not affect you if you only use single-byte (like
    SQL_ASCII or the ISO-8859-X family) or unaffected multibyte (like
    UTF-8) encodings.</p>

    <p>psycopg and python-pgsql use the old encoding for binary data and
    may have to be updated.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is affected by these problems but
we're unable to correct the package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.7-6sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 7.4.13-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgresql packages.</p>
