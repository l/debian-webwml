<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, that can
lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to
the execution of arbitrary code.  The same code is present in kpdf
which is part of the kdegraphics package.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.3.2-2sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.0-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf package.</p>
