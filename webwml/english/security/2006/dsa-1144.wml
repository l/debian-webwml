<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that one of the utilities shipped with chmlib, a
library for dealing with Microsoft CHM files, performs insufficient
sanitising of filenames, which might lead to directory traversal.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.35-6sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.38-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your chmlib-bin package.</p>
