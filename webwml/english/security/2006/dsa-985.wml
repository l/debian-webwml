<p>Evgeny Legerov discovered several out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
DER decoding component of the Tiny ASN.1 Library that allows
attackers to crash the DER decoder and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2_0.2.10-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtasn1 packages.</p>
