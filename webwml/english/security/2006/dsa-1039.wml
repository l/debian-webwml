<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in blender, a very fast
and versatile 3D modeller/renderer.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures Project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3302">CVE-2005-3302</a>

    <p>Joxean Koret discovered that due to missing input validation a
    provided script is vulnerable to arbitrary command execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4470">CVE-2005-4470</a>

    <p>Damian Put discovered a buffer overflow that allows remote
    attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute
    arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.36-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.40-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your blender package.</p>
