<p>Russ Allbery discovered that rssh, a restricted shell, performs
insufficient checking of incoming commands, which might lead to a bypass
of access restrictions.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.3-1.sarge.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3.0-1.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your rssh package.</p>
