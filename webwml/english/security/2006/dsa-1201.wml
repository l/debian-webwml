<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ethereal network
scanner. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4574">CVE-2005-4574</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the MIME multipart dissector is vulnerable to
    denial of service caused by an off-by-one overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4805">CVE-2006-4805</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the XOT dissector is vulnerable to denial
    of service caused by memory corruption.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge9. Due to technical problems with the security
buildd infrastructure this update lacks builds for the hppa and sparc
architecture. They will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
