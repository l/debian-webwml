<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Simon Kilvington discovered that specially crafted PNG images can trigger
a heap overflow in libavcodec, the multimedia library of ffmpeg, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
xine-lib includes a local copy of libavcodec.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) isn't affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1.5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib package.</p>
