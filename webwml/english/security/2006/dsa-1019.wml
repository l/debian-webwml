<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Derek Noonburg has fixed several potential vulnerabilities in xpdf,
the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is also present in
koffice, the KDE Office Suite.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.5-4.sarge.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf package.</p>
