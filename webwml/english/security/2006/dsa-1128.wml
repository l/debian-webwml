<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Yan Rong Ge discovered that wrong permissions on a shared memory page
in heartbeat, the subsystem for High-Availability Linux could be
exploited by a local attacker to cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.3-9sarge5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heartbeat packages.</p>
