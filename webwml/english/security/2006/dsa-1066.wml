<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that phpbb2, a web based bulletin board, does
insufficiently sanitise values passed to the "Font Colour 3" setting,
which might lead to the execution of injected code by admin users.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain phpbb2 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.13+1-6sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpbb2 package.</p>
