<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that two scripts in antiword, utilities to convert Word
files to text and Postscript, create a temporary file in an insecure
fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.32-2woody0.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.35-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.35-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your antiword package.</p>
