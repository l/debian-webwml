<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in drupal, a
fully-featured content management/discussion engine.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3973">CVE-2005-3973</a>

    <p>Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3974">CVE-2005-3974</a>

    <p>When running on PHP5, Drupal does not correctly enforce user
    privileges, which allows remote attackers to bypass the "access
    user profiles" permission.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3975">CVE-2005-3975</a>

    <p>An interpretation conflict allows remote authenticated users to
    inject arbitrary web script or HTML via HTML in a file with a GIF
    or JPEG file extension.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain drupal packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.3-5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal package.</p>
