<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is
also present in gpdf, the GNOME version of the Portable Document
Format viewer, and which can lead to a denial of service by crashing
the application or possibly to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain gpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge2</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf package.</p>
