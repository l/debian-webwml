<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in lynx, the popular
text-mode WWW browser.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
Project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2004-1617">CVE-2004-1617</a>

    <p>Michal Zalewski discovered that lynx is not able to grok invalid
    HTML including a TEXTAREA tag with a large COLS value and a large
    tag name in an element that is not terminated, and loops forever
    trying to render the broken HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CAN-2005-3120">CAN-2005-3120</a>

    <p>Ulf Härnhammar discovered a buffer overflow that can be remotely
    exploited. During the handling of Asian characters when connecting
    to an NNTP server lynx can be tricked to write past the boundary
    of a buffer which can lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2.5woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.6-9sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lynx-cur package.</p>
