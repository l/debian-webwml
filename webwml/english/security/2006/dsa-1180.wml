<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered two security related bugs in bomberclone, a
free Bomberman clone.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4005">CVE-2006-4005</a>

    <p>The program copies remotely provided data unchecked which could
    lead to a denial of service via an application crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4006">CVE-2006-4006</a>

    <p>Bomberclone uses remotely provided data as length argument which
    can lead to the disclosure of private information.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11.5-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11.7-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bomberclone package.</p>
