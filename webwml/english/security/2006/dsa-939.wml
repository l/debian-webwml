<p>Daniel Drake discovered a problem in fetchmail, an SSL enabled POP3,
APOP, IMAP mail gatherer/forwarder, that can cause a crash when the
program is running in multidrop mode and receives messages without
headers.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.5-12sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.3.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fetchmail package.</p>
