<p>It has been discovered that sudo, a privileged program, that provides
limited super user privileges to specific users, passes several
environment variables to the program that runs with elevated
privileges.  In the case of include paths (e.g. for Perl, Python, Ruby
or other scripting languages) this can cause arbitrary code to be
executed as privileged user if the attacker points to a manipulated
version of a system library.</p>

<p>This update alters the former behaviour of sudo and limits the number
of supported environment variables to LC_*, LANG, LANGUAGE and TERM.
Additional variables are only passed through when set as env_check in
/etc/sudoers, which might be required for some scripts to continue to
work.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.6-1.5.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8p7-1.3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.8p12-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your sudo package.  For unstable
"Defaults = env_reset" need to be addeed to /etc/sudoers manually.</p>
