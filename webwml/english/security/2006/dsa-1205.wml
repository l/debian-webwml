<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>Marco d'Itri discovered that thttpd, a small, fast and secure webserver,
makes use of insecure temporary files when its logfiles are rotated,
which might lead to a denial of service through a symlink attack.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.23beta1-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.23beta1-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your thttpd package.</p>
