<p>Several problems have been discovered in the TIFF library.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2193">CVE-2006-2193</a>

    <p>SuSE discovered a buffer overflow in the conversion of TIFF files
    into PDF documents which could be exploited when tiff2pdf is used
    e.g. in a printer filter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2656">CVE-2006-2656</a>

    <p>The tiffsplit command from the TIFF library contains a buffer
    overflow in the commandline handling which could be exploited when
    the program is executed automatically on unknown filenames.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.5.5-7woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-5.</p>
