    <p>Fernando Ribeiro discovered that a vulnerability in the getRawDER
    function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service

    <p>Priit Laes reported that a JavaScript regular expression can
    trigger a heap-based buffer overflow which allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4568">CVE-2006-4568</a>

    <p>A vulnerability has been discovered that allows remote attackers

    <p>Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Firefox, Thunderbird and
    SeaMonkey allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service,

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.2-2.sarge1.0.8c.1.</p>
