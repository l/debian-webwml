<p>Hendrik Weimer discovered that specially crafted web requests can
cause awstats, a powerful and featureful web server log analyzer, to
execute arbitrary commands.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.4-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.5-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your awstats package.</p>
