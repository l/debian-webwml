<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered missing boundary checks in freeciv, a clone
of the well known Civilisation game, which can be exploited by remote
attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.1-1sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeciv package.</p>
