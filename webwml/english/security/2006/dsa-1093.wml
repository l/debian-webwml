<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several format string vulnerabilities have been discovered in xine-ui,
the user interface of the xine video player, which may cause a denial
of service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.3-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-ui package.</p>
