<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy discovered several vulnerabilities in the TIFF library
that can lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2024">CVE-2006-2024</a>

    <p>Multiple vulnerabilities allow attackers to cause a denial of
    service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2025">CVE-2006-2025</a>

    <p>An integer overflow allows attackers to cause a denial of service
    and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2026">CVE-2006-2026</a>

    <p>A double-free vulnerability allows attackers to cause a denial of
    service and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.5-7woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.2-3sarge1.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not vulnerable to these problems.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.</p>
