<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Chris Moore discovered that flex, a scanner generator, generates code,
which allocates insufficient memory, if the grammar contains REJECT
statements or trailing context rules. This may lead to a buffer overflow
and the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>If you use code, which is derived from a vulnerable lex grammar in
an untrusted environment you need to regenerate your scanner with the
fixed version of flex.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.31-31sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.5.33-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your flex package.</p>
