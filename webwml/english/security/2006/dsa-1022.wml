<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the backup utility 
storebackup. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3146">CVE-2005-3146</a>

    <p>Storebackup creates a temporary file predictably, which can be
    exploited to overwrite arbitrary files on the system with a symlink
    attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3147">CVE-2005-3147</a>

    <p>The backup root directory wasn't created with fixed permissions, which may lead to
       inproper permissions if the umask is too lax.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3148">CVE-2005-3148</a>

    <p>The user and group rights of symlinks are set incorrectly when making
    or restoring a backup, which may leak sensitive data.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain storebackup packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.18.4-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.19-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your storebackup package.</p>
