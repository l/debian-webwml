<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the mutt mail reader performs insufficient
validation of values returned from an IMAP server, which might overflow
a buffer and potentially lead to the injection of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.9-2sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.11+cvs20060403-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mutt package.</p>
