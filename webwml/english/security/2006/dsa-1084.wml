<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Niko Tyni discovered a buffer overflow in the processing of network
data in typespeed, a game for testing and improving typing speed, which
could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.1-2.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.4-8sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.4.4-10.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your typespeed packages.</p>
