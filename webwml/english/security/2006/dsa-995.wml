<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered a buffer overflow in metamail, an
implementation of MIME (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions), that
could lead to a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary
code when processing messages.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-45woody.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-47sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7-51.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your metamail package.</p>
