<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Derek Noonburg has fixed several potential vulnerabilities in xpdf,
which are also present in gpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF)
viewer with Gtk bindings.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain gpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf package.</p>
