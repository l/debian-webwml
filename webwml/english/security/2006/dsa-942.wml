<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A design error has been discovered in the Albatross web application
toolkit that causes user supplied data to be used as part of template
execution and hence arbitrary code execution.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain albatross packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.20-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.33-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your albatross package.</p>
