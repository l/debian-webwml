<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in the GNU texinfo package, a
documentation system for on-line information and printed output.</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3011">CVE-2005-3011</a>

    <p>Handling of temporary files is performed in an insecure manner, allowing
    an attacker to overwrite any file writable by the victim.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4810">CVE-2006-4810</a>

    <p>A buffer overflow in util/texindex.c could allow an attacker to execute
    arbitrary code with the victim's access rights by inducing the victim to
    run texindex or tex2dvi on a specially crafted texinfo file.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 4.7-2.2sarge2. Note that binary packages for the mipsel
architecture are not currently available due to technical problems with
the build host. These packages will be made available as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>For unstable (sid) and the upcoming stable release (etch), these
problems have been fixed in version 4.8.dfsg.1-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your texinfo package.</p>
