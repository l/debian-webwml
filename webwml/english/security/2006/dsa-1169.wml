<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL
database server.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4226">CVE-2006-4226</a>

    <p>Michal Prokopiuk discovered that remote authenticated users are
    permitted to create and access a database if the lowercase
    spelling is the same as one they have been granted access to.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4380">CVE-2006-4380</a>

    <p>Beat Vontobel discovered that certain queries replicated to a
    slave could crash the client and thus terminate the replication.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.11a-4sarge7.  Version 4.0 is not affected by these
problems.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 5.0.24-3.  The replication problem only exists in version 4.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-server-4.1 package.</p>
