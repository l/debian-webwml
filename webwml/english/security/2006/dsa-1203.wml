<p>Steve Rigler discovered that the PAM module for authentication against
LDAP servers processes PasswordPolicyReponse control messages incorrectly,
which might lead to an attacker being able to login into a suspended
system account.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 178-1sarge3. Due to technical problems with the security
buildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc
architecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 180-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libpam-ldap package.</p>
