<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Eric Romang discovered that xpvm, a graphical console and monitor for
PVM, creates a temporary file that allows local attackers to create or
overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user running
xpvm.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-7.2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-7.3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.2.5-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpvm package.</p>
