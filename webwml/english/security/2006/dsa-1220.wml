<define-tag description>insecure file name quoting</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Brian May discovered that pstotext, a utility to extract plain text from
Postscript and PDF files, performs insufficient quoting of file names,
which allows execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9-1sarge2. The build for the mipsel architecture is not yet
available due to technical problems with the build host.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.9-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pstotext package.</p>
