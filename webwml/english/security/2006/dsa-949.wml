<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered a
security related problem in crawl, another console based dungeon
exploration game in the vein of nethack and rogue.  The program
executes commands insecurely when saving or loading games which can
allow local attackers to gain group games privileges.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.0beta23-2woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.0beta26-4sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.0beta26-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your crawl package.</p>
