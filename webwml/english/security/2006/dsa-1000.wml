<p>An algorithm weakness has been discovered in Apache2::Request, the
generic request library for Apache2 which can be exploited remotely
and cause a denial of service via CPU consumption.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.04-dev-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.07-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapreq2, libapache2-mod-apreq2
and libapache2-request-perl packages.</p>
