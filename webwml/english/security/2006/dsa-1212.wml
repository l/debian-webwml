<define-tag description>Denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two denial of service problems have been found in the OpenSSH
server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4924">CVE-2006-4924</a>

    <p>The sshd support for ssh protocol version 1 does not properly
    handle duplicate incoming blocks. This could allow a remote
    attacker to cause sshd to consume significant CPU resources
    leading to a denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-5051">CVE-2006-5051</a>

    <p>A signal handler race condition could potentially allow a remote
    attacker to crash sshd and could theoretically lead to the
    ability to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1:3.8.1p1-8.sarge.6.</p>

<p>For the unstable and testing distributions, these problems have been
fixed in version 1:4.3p2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssh package.</p>
