<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jack Louis discovered an integer overflow in Perl, Larry Wall's
Practical Extraction and Report Language, that allows attackers to
overwrite arbitrary memory and possibly execute arbitrary code via
specially crafted content that is passed to vulnerable format strings
of third party software.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.4-8sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.8.7-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your perl packages.</p>
