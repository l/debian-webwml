<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A boundary checking error has been discovered in wv2, a library for
accessing Microsoft Word documents, which can lead to an integer
overflow induced by processing word files.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain wv2 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.2-1sarge1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libwv packages.</p>
