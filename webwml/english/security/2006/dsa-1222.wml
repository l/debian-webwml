<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Due to technical problems yesterday's proftpd update lacked a build for
the amd64 architecture, which is now available. For reference please find
below the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the proftpd FTP
daemon, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial
of service. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5815">CVE-2006-5815</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the <code>sreplace()</code> function
    may lead to denial of service and possibly the execution of arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6170">CVE-2006-6170</a>

    <p>It was discovered that a buffer overflow in the mod_tls addon module
    may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-6171">CVE-2006-6171</a>

    <p>It was discovered that insufficient validation of FTP command buffer
    size limits may lead to denial of service. Due to unclear information
    this issue was already fixed in <a href="dsa-1218">DSA-1218</a> as <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5815">CVE-2006-5815</a>.</p></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in version
1.2.10-15sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.0-16 of the proftpd-dfsg package.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your proftpd package.</p>
