<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammer from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered that
streamripper, a utility to record online radio-streams, performs
insufficient sanitising of data received from the streaming server,
which might lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.61.7-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.61.25-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your streamripper package.</p>
