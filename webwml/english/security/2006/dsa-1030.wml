<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in libphp-adodb, the
'adodb' database abstraction layer for PHP, which is embedded in
moodle, a course management system for online learning.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0146">CVE-2006-0146</a>

    <p>Andreas Sandblad discovered that improper user input sanitisation
    results in a potential remote SQL injection vulnerability enabling
    an attacker to compromise applications, access or modify data, or
    exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.
    This requires the MySQL root password to be empty.  It is fixed by
    limiting access to the script in question.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0147">CVE-2006-0147</a>

    <p>A dynamic code evaluation vulnerability allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary PHP functions via the 'do' parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0410">CVE-2006-0410</a>

    <p>Andy Staudacher discovered an SQL injection vulnerability due to
    insufficient input sanitising that allows remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0806">CVE-2006-0806</a>

    <p>GulfTech Security Research discovered multiple cross-site
    scripting vulnerabilities due to improper user-supplied input
    sanitisation.  Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to
    cause arbitrary scripts to be executed in the browser of an
    unsuspecting user's machine, or result in the theft of
    cookie-based authentication credentials.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain moodle packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.4.dfsg.1-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your moodle package.</p>
