<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Crossfire, a multiplayer adventure game, performs
insufficient bounds checking on network packets when run in "oldsocketmode",
which may possibly lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0-1woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.6.0.dfsg.1-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.0-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your crossfire packages.</p>
