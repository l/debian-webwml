<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that the winbind plugin in pppd does not
check whether a setuid() call has been successful when trying to drop
privileges, which may fail with some PAM configurations.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.3-20050321+2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.4rel-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ppp package.</p>
