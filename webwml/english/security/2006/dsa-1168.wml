<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in Imagemagick, a
collection of image manipulation tools, which may lead to the execution
of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2440">CVE-2006-2440</a>

    <p>Eero Häkkinen discovered that the display tool allocates insufficient
    memory for globbing patterns, which might lead to a buffer overflow.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3743">CVE-2006-3743</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the Sun
    bitmap decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>
    
<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3744">CVE-2006-3744</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered that the XCF
    image decoder performs insufficient input sanitising, which might
    lead to buffer overflows and the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 6:6.0.6.2-2.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
