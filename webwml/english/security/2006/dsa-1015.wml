<p>Mark Dowd discovered a flaw in the handling of asynchronous signals in
sendmail, a powerful, efficient, and scalable mail transport agent.
This allows a remote attacker may to exploit a race condition to
execute arbitrary code as root.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.12.3-7.2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.4-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 8.13.6-1.</p>
