<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jason Duell discovered that cscope, a source code browsing tool, does not
verify the length of file names sourced in include statements, which may
potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially
crafted source code files.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 15.3-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 15.5-1.1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cscope package.</p>
