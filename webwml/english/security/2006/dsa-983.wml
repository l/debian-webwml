<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Derek Noonburg has fixed several potential vulnerabilities in xpdf,
which are also present in pdftohtml, a utility that translates PDF
documents into HTML format.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdftohtml packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.36-11sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.36-12.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdftohtml package.</p>
