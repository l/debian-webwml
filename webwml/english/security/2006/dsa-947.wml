<define-tag description>heap overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap overflow has been discovered in ClamAV, a virus scanner, which
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a carefully
crafted UPX-encoded executable to a system running ClamAV. In addition,
other potential overflows have been corrected.</p>

<p>Packages for the ARM architecture were not available when DSA 947-1 was
released; these packages are now available. Also, DSA 947-1 incorrectly
identified the package version which corrected these issues in the
unstable distribution (sid).</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not include ClamAV.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.88-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package immediately.</p>
