<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A heap overflow has been discovered in ClamAV, a virus scanner, which
could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by sending a carefully
crafted UPX-encoded executable to a system runnig ClamAV. In addition,
other potential overflows have been corrected.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not include ClamAV.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.86.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package immediately.</p>
