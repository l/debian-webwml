<define-tag description>filedescriptor leak</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Stefan Pfetzing discovered that lshd, a Secure Shell v2 (SSH2)
protocol server, leaks a couple of file descriptors, related to the
randomness generator, to user shells which are started by lshd.  A
local attacker can truncate the server's seed file, which may prevent
the server from starting, and with some more effort, maybe also crack
session keys.</p>

<p>After applying this update, you should remove the server's seed file
(/var/spool/lsh/yarrow-seed-file) and then regenerate it with
"lsh-make-seed --server" as root.</p>

<p>For security reasons, lsh-make-seed really needs to be run from the
console of the system you are running it on.  If you run lsh-make-seed
using a remote shell, the timing information lsh-make-seed uses for
its random seed creation is likely to be screwed.  If need be, you can
generate the random seed on a different system than that which it will
eventually be on, by installing the lsh-utils package and running
"lsh-make-seed -o my-other-server-seed-file".  You may then transfer
the seed to the destination system as using a secure connection.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) may not be affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.1cdbs-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lsh-server package.</p>
