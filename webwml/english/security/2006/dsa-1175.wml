<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A flaw has been found in isakmpd, OpenBSD's implementation of the
Internet Key Exchange protocol, that caused Security Associations to be
created with a replay window of 0 when isakmpd was acting as the
responder during SA negotiation.  This could allow an attacker to
re-inject sniffed IPsec packets, which would not be checked against the
replay counter.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 20041012-1sarge1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 20041012-4</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your isakmpd package.</p>
