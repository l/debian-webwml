<define-tag description>cross-site request forgery</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that Trac, a wiki and issue tracking system for
software development projects, performs insufficient validation against
cross-site request forgery, which might lead to an attacker being able
to perform manipulation of a Trac site with the privileges of the
attacked Trac user.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3sarge6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.10.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trac package.</p>
