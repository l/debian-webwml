<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Niko Tyni discovered that the Mail::Audit module, a Perl library for
creating simple mail filters, logs to a temporary file with a
predictable filename in an insecure fashion when logging is turned on,
which is not the case by default.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0-4woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1-5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1-5sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmail-audit-perl package.</p>
