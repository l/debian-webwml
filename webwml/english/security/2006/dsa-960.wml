<define-tag description>insecure temporary file creation</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The former update caused temporary files to be created in the current
working directory due to a wrong function argument.  This update will
create temporary files in the users home directory if HOME is set or
in the common temporary directory otherwise, usually /tmp.  For
completeness below is a copy of the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Niko Tyni discovered that the Mail::Audit module, a Perl library for
creating simple mail filters, logs to a temporary file with a
predictable filename in an insecure fashion when logging is turned on,
which is not the case by default.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0-4woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1-5sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1-5.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmail-audit-perl package.</p>
