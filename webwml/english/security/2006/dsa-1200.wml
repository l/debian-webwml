<define-tag description>integer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>An integer overflow has been found in the pixmap handling routines in
the Qt GUI libraries.  This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of
service and possibly execute arbitrary code by providing a specially
crafted image file and inducing the victim to view it in an application
based on Qt.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 3:3.3.4-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
versions 3:3.3.7-1 and 4.2.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your qt-x11-free packages.</p>
