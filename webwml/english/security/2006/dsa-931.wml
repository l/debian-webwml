<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, that can
lead to a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to
the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.00-3.8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.00-13.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.01-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf package.</p>
