<p>Peter Bieringer discovered that postgrey, an greylisting
implementation for Postfix, is vulnerable to a format string attack
that allows remote attackers to the daemon.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has also been fixed
in version 1.21-1volatile4 in the volatile archive.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.22-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your postgrey package.</p>
