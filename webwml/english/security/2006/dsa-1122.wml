<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Peter Bieringer discovered that the "log" function in the Net::Server
Perl module, an extensible, general perl server engine, is not safe
against format string exploits.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.87-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.89-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libnet-server-perl package.</p>
