<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Evgeny Legerov discovered that gnupg, the GNU privacy guard, a free
PGP replacement contains an integer overflow that can cause a
segmentation fault and possibly overwrite memory via a large user ID
strings.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-4woody6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg package.</p>
