<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jim Meyering discovered several buffer overflows in GNU tar, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code through specially crafted tar
archives.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.14-2.1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.15.1-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tar package.</p>
