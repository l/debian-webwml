<p>Evgeny Legerov discovered several out-of-bounds memory accesses in the
DER decoding component of the Tiny ASN.1 Library, which is
also present and used in GnuTLS, the GNU implementation for Transport
Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) 3.0 protocols
and which allows attackers to crash the DER decoder and possibly
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.16-13.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnutls packages.</p>
