<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Jürgen Weigert discovered that upon unpacking JAR archives fastjar
from the GNU Compiler Collection does not check the path for included
files and allows to create or overwrite files in upper directories.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.3-13sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-11.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fastjar package.</p>
