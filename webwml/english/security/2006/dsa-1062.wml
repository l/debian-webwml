<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Sven Dreyer discovered that KPhone, a Voice over IP client for KDE,
creates a configuration file world-readable, which could leak sensitive
information like SIP passwords.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain kphone packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.0-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kphone package. If your current kphonerc
has too lax permissions, you'll need to reset them manually.</p>
