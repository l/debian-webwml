<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a flaw in GNU TLS cryptographic package
that could allow an attacker to generate a forged signature that GNU TLS
will accept as valid.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.16-13.2sarge2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain gnutls11, for
gnutls13 this problem has been fixed in version 1.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your GNU TLS package.</p>
