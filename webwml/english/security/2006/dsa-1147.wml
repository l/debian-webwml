<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ayman Hourieh discovered that Drupal, a dynamic website platform,
performs insufficient input sanitising in the user module, which
might lead to cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.3-6.1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal package.</p>
