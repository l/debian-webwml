<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in Mantis, a
web-based bug tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4238">CVE-2005-4238</a>

    <p>Missing input sanitising allows remote attackers  to inject
    arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4518">CVE-2005-4518</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis allows remote attackers to
    bypass the file upload size restriction.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4519">CVE-2005-4519</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered several SQL injection vulnerabilities that
    allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4520">CVE-2005-4520</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered unspecified "port injection"
    vulnerabilities in filters.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4521">CVE-2005-4521</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered a CRLF injection vulnerability that allows
    remote attackers to modify HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response
    splitting attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4522">CVE-2005-4522</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered several cross-site scripting (XSS)
    vulnerabilities that allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary
    web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4523">CVE-2005-4523</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis discloses private bugs via
    public RSS feeds, which allows remote attackers to obtain
    sensitive information.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4524">CVE-2005-4524</a>

    <p>Tobias Klein discovered that Mantis does not properly handle "Make
    note private" when a bug is being resolved, which has unknown
    impact and attack vectors, probably related to an information
    leak.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not seem to be affected by
these problems.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.2-5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.19.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mantis package.</p>
