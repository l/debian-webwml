<p>Andrea Barisani discovered that zgv, an svgalib graphics viewer,
attempts to decode JPEG images within the CMYK/YCCK colour space
incorrectly, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.5-3woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.7-1.4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed soon.</p>


<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zgv package.</p>
