<p>Will Aoki discovered that snmptrapfmt, a configurable snmp trap
handler daemon for snmpd, does not prevent overwriting existing files
when writing to a temporary log file.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.03woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.08sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your snmptrapfmt package.</p>
