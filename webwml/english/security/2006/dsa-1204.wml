<p>It was discovered that the Ingo email filter rules manager performs 
insufficient escaping of user-provided data in created procmail rules
files, which allows the execution of arbitrary shell commands.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ingo1 package.</p>
