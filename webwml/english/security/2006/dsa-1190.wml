<p>Oliver Karow discovered that the WebDBM frontend of the MaxDB database
performs insufficient sanitising of requests passed to it, which might
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 7.5.00.24-4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your maxdb-7.5.00 package.</p>
