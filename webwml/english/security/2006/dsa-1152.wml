<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Felix Wiemann discovered that trac, an enhanced Wiki and issue
tracking system for software development projects, can be used to
disclose arbitrary local files.  To fix this problem, python-docutils
needs to be updated as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3sarge5 of trac and version 0.3.7-2sarge1 of
python-docutils.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trac and python-docutils packages.</p>
