<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Evgeny Legerov discovered that gnupg, the GNU privacy guard, a free
PGP replacement contains an integer overflow that can cause a
segmentation fault and possibly overwrite memory via a large user ID
strings.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.sarge4 of GnuPG and in version 1.9.15-6sarge1 of GnuPG2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.3-2 of GnuPG, a fix for GnuPG2 is pending.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg package.</p>
