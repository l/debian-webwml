<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar and Max Vozeler from the Debian Security Audit Project
have found several format string security bugs in osiris, a
network-wide system integrity monitor control interface.  A remote
attacker could exploit them and cause a denial of service or execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.0.6-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.2.0-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your osiris packages.</p>
