<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenOffice.org, a free
office suite.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2198">CVE-2006-2198</a>

    <p>It turned out to be possible to embed arbitrary BASIC macros in
    documents in a way that OpenOffice.org does not see them but
    executes them anyway without any user interaction.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-2199">CVE-2006-2199</a>

    <p>It is possible to evade the Java sandbox with specially crafted
    Java applets.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3117">CVE-2006-3117</a>

    <p>Loading malformed XML documents can cause buffer overflows and
    cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.</p>

</ul>

<p>This update has the Mozilla component disabled, so that the
Mozilla/LDAP adressbook feature won't work anymore.  It didn't work on
anything else than i386 on sarge either.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain OpenOffice.org
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.3-9sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your OpenOffice.org packages.</p>
