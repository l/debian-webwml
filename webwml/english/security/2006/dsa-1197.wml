<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Benjamin C. Wiley Sittler discovered that the repr() of the Python 
interpreter allocates insufficient memory when parsing UCS-4 Unicode
strings, which might lead to execution of arbitrary code through
a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.1-2sarge1. Due to build problems this update lacks fixed
packages for the m68k architecture. Once they are sorted out, binaries
for m68k will be released.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.4.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Python 2.4 packages.</p>
