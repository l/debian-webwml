<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Derek Noonburg has fixed several potential vulnerabilities in xpdf,
which are also present in libextractor, a library to extract arbitrary
meta-data from files.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain libextractor packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.2-2sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.10-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libextractor package.</p>
