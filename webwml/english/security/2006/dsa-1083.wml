<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mehdi Oudad and Kevin Fernandez discovered a buffer overflow in the
ktools library which is used in motor, an integrated development
environment for C, C++ and Java, which may lead local attackers to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.2.2-2woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.0-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.4.0-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your motor package.</p>
