<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered several buffer overflows in libmusicbrainz,
a CD index library, that allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service or execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-10sarge1 and 2.1.1-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libmusicbrainz packages.</p>
