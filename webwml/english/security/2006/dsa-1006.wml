<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"kcope" discovered that the wzdftpd FTP server lacks input sanitising
for the SITE command, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
shell commands.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain wzdftpd packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-1.1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your wzdftpd package.</p>
