<p>Lincoln Stein discovered that the Perl Crypt::CBC module produces weak
ciphertext when used with block encryption algorithms with blocksize &gt;
8 bytes.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a Crypt::CBC module.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.12-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.17-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libcrypt-cbc-perl package.</p>
