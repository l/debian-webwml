<define-tag description>format string vulnerability</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>iDEFENSE reports that a format string vulnerability in mod_auth_pgsql, a
library used to authenticate web users against a PostgreSQL database,
could be used to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the httpd
user.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain
libapache2-mod-auth-pgsql.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.2b1-5sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libapache2-mod-auth-pgsql package.</p>
