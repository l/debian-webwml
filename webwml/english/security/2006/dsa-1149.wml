<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy from the Google Security Team discovered a missing
boundary check in ncompress, the original Lempel-Ziv compress and
uncompress programs, which allows a specially crafted datastream to
underflow a buffer with attacker controlled data.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.4-15sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
