<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer overflows in xpdf,
the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which is also present in
tetex-bin, the binary files of teTeX, and which can lead to a denial of
service by crashing the application or possibly to the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.0.7+20011202-7.7.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.2-30sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.3-2 of poppler against which tetex-bin links.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tetex-bin package.</p>
