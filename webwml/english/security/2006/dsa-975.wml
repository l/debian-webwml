<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that attackers can trigger a buffer overflow
in the path handling code by creating or abusing existing symlinks, which
may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>This vulnerability isn't present in the kernel NFS server.</p>

<p>This update includes a bugfix for attribute handling of symlinks. This
fix does not have security implications, but at the time when this DSA
was prepared it was already queued for the next stable point release, so
we decided to include it beforehand.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2beta47-12woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2beta47-20sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2beta47-22.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nfs-user-server package.</p>
