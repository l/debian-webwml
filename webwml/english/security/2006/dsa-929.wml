<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered a buffer
overflow in petris, a clone of the Tetris game, which may be exploited
to execute arbitary code with group games privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain the petris package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-4sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution the package will be updated shortly.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your petris package.</p>
