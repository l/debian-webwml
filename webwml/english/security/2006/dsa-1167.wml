<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Apache, the
worlds most popular webserver, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
web script.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies
the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3352">CVE-2005-3352</a>

   <p>A cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw exists in the mod_imap component of
   the Apache server.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3918">CVE-2006-3918</a>

   <p>Apache does not sanitize the Expect header from an HTTP request when 
   it is reflected back in an error message, which might allow cross-site 
   scripting (XSS) style attacks.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.33-6sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.34-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your apache package.</p>
