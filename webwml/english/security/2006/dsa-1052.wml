<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several buffer overflows have been discovered in cgiirc, a web-based
IRC client, which could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain cgiirc packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-6sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.5.4-6sarge1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cgiirc package.</p>
