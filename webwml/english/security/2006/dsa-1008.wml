<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcelo Ricardo Leitner noticed that the current patch in DSA <a href="dsa-932">932</a>
(<a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3627">CVE-2005-3627</a>) for kpdf, the PDF viewer for KDE, does not fix all
buffer overflows, still allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-2sarge4.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kpdf package.</p>
