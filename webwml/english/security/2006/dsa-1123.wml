<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Luigi Auriemma discovered that DUMB, a tracker music library, performs
insufficient sanitising of values parsed from IT music files, which might
lead to a buffer overflow and execution of arbitrary code if manipulated
files are read.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.2-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.3-5.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libdumb packages.</p>
