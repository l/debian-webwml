    array write and buffer overflow that could lead to a denial of
    service and the possible execution of arbitrary code.  [MFSA-2006-11]</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1740">CVE-2006-1740</a>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1741">CVE-2006-1741</a>

    <p>"shutdown" discovered that it is possible to inject arbitrary
    JavaScript code into a page on another site using a modal alert to

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1742">CVE-2006-1742</a>

    <p>Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine does not
