<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Toth Andras discovered that the fbgs framebuffer postscript/PDF viewer
contains a typo, which prevents the intended filter against malicious
postscript commands from working correctly. This might lead to the
deletion of user data when displaying a postscript file.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.01-1.2sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fbi package.</p>
