<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ethereal network
scanner, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4333">CVE-2006-4333</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the Q.2391 dissector is vulnerable to denial
    of service caused by memory exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3241">CVE-2005-3241</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the FC-FCS, RSVP and ISIS-LSP dissectors are
    vulnerable to denial of service caused by memory exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3242">CVE-2005-3242</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the IrDA and SMB dissectors are vulnerable to
    denial of service caused by memory corruption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3243">CVE-2005-3243</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the SLIMP3 and AgentX dissectors are vulnerable
    to code injection caused by buffer overflows.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3244">CVE-2005-3244</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the BER dissector is vulnerable to denial of
    service caused by an infinite loop.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3246">CVE-2005-3246</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the NCP and RTnet dissectors are vulnerable to
    denial of service caused by a null pointer dereference.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3248">CVE-2005-3248</a>

    <p>It was discovered that the X11 dissector is vulnerable denial of service
    caused by a division through zero.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>This update also fixes a 64 bit-specific regression in the ASN.1 decoder, which
was introduced in a previous DSA.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.2-5.1 of wireshark, the network sniffer formerly known as
ethereal.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
