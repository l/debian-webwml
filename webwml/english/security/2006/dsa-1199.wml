<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been identified in webmin, a web-based
administration toolkit. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3912">CVE-2005-3912</a>
	<p>A format string vulnerability in miniserv.pl could allow an
	attacker to cause a denial of service by crashing the
	application or exhausting system resources, and could
	potentially allow arbitrary code execution.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3392">CVE-2006-3392</a>
	<p>Improper input sanitization in miniserv.pl could allow an
	attacker to read arbitrary files on the webmin host by providing
	a specially crafted URL path to the miniserv http server.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4542">CVE-2006-4542</a>
	<p>Improper handling of null characters in URLs in miniserv.pl
	could allow an attacker to conduct cross-site scripting attacks,
	read CGI program source code, list local directories, and
	potentially execute arbitrary code.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Stable updates are available for alpha, amd64, arm, hppa, i386, ia64,
m68k, mips, mipsel, powerpc, s390 and sparc.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), these problems have been fixed in
version 1.180-3sarge1.</p>

<p>Webmin is not included in unstable (sid) or testing (etch), so these
problems are not present.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webmin (1.180-3sarge1) package.</p>
