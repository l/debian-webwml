<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ClamAV
anti-virus toolkit, which may lead to denial of service and potentially
to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1614">CVE-2006-1614</a>

    <p>Damian Put discovered an integer overflow in the PE header parser.
    This is only exploitable if the ArchiveMaxFileSize option is disabled.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1615">CVE-2006-1615</a>

    <p>Format string vulnerabilities in the logging code have been discovered,
    which might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-1630">CVE-2006-1630</a>
    
    David Luyer discovered, that ClamAV can be tricked into an invalid
    memory access in the cli_bitset_set() function, which may lead to
    a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain clamav packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.88.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav package.</p>
