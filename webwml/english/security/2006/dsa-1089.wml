<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several problems have been discovered in freeradius, a
high-performance and highly configurable RADIUS server.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4744">CVE-2005-4744</a>

    <p>SuSE researchers have discovered several off-by-one errors may
    allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly
    execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1354">CVE-2006-1354</a>

    <p>Due to insufficient input validation it is possible for a remote
    attacker to bypass authentication or cause a denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.2-4sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.0-1.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your freeradius package.</p>
