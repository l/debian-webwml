<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf, the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which are
also present in gpdf, the viewer with Gtk bindings, and which can lead
to a denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.10.0-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf package.</p>
