<p>Ulf HÃ¤rnhammar discovered several format string vulnerabilities in
Evolution, a free groupware suite, that could lead to crashes of the
application or the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) these problems have been fixed
in version 1.0.5-1woody3.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.3-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your evolution package.</p>
