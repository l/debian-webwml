<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that a race condition in the process filesystem can lead
to privilege escalation.</p>

<p>The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fixes the problem mentioned above:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th>                        </th><th>Debian 3.1 (sarge)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Source                  </td><td>2.6.8-16sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alpha architecture      </td><td>2.6.8-16sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>AMD64 architecture      </td><td>2.6.8-16sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Intel IA-32 architecture</td><td>2.6.8-16sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Intel IA-64 architecture</td><td>2.6.8-14sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>PowerPC architecture    </td><td>2.6.8-12sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Sun Sparc architecture  </td><td>2.6.8-15sarge4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>As an exploit for this issue in the wild, this advisory was sent out without
builds for the IBM S/390, Motorola 680x0 and HP Precision architectures being
available. They will be released in a followup-advisory as soon as they
are available. Also, the kernels for the FAI installer haven't been updated
yet. As a workaround we recommend to mount proc with the nosuid and noexec
options.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
