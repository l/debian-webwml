<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in Mozilla and
derived products such as Mozilla Thunderbird.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-2788">CVE-2006-2788</a>

    <p>Fernando Ribeiro discovered that a vulnerability in the getRawDER
    function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (hang) and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4340">CVE-2006-4340</a>

    <p>Daniel Bleichenbacher recently described an implementation error
    in RSA signature verification that cause the application to
    incorrectly trust SSL certificates.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4565">CVE-2006-4565</a>, <a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4566">CVE-2006-4566</a>

    <p>Priit Laes reported that a JavaScript regular expression can
    trigger a heap-based buffer overflow which allows remote attackers
    to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4568">CVE-2006-4568</a>

    <p>A vulnerability has been discovered that allows remote attackers
    to bypass the security model and inject content into the sub-frame

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4570">CVE-2006-4570</a>

    <p>Georgi Guninski demonstrated that even with JavaScript disabled in
    mail (the default) an attacker can still execute JavaScript when a
    mail message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4571">CVE-2006-4571</a>

    <p>Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Firefox, Thunderbird and
    SeaMonkey allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service,
    corrupt memory, and possibly execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge7.3.1.</p>
