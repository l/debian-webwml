<p>Andrey Kiselev discovered a problem in the TIFF library that may allow
an attacker with a specially crafted TIFF image with Yr/Yg/Yb values
that exceed the YCR/YCG/YCB values to crash the library and hence the
surrounding application.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.7.2-4.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tiff packages and restart the
programs using it.</p>
