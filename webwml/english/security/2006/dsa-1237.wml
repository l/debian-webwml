<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4093">CVE-2005-4093</a>

    <p>Olof Johansson reported a local DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability
    on the PPC970 platform. Unprivileged users can hang the system by
    executing the <q>attn</q> instruction, which was not being disabled at boot.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4538">CVE-2006-4538</a>

    <p>Kirill Korotaev reported a local DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability
    on the ia64 and sparc architectures. A user could cause the system to
    crash by executing a malformed ELF binary due to insufficient verification
    of the memory layout.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4997">CVE-2006-4997</a>

    <p>ADLab Venustech Info Ltd reported a potential remote DoS (Denial of
    Service) vulnerability in the IP over ATM subsystem. A remote system
    could cause the system to crash by sending specially crafted packets
    that would trigger an attempt to free an already-freed pointer
    resulting in a system crash.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5174">CVE-2006-5174</a>

    <p>Martin Schwidefsky reported a potential leak of sensitive information
    on s390 systems. The copy_from_user function did not clear the remaining
    bytes of the kernel buffer after receiving a fault on the userspace
    address, resulting in a leak of uninitialized kernel memory. A local user
    could exploit this by appending to a file from a bad address.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5649">CVE-2006-5649</a>

    <p>Fabio Massimo Di Nitto reported a potential remote DoS (Denial of Service)
    vulnerability on powerpc systems.  The alignment exception only
    checked the exception table for -EFAULT, not for other errors. This can
    be exploited by a local user to cause a system crash (panic).</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5871">CVE-2006-5871</a>

    <p>Bill Allombert reported that various mount options are ignored by smbfs
    when UNIX extensions are enabled. This includes the uid, gid and mode
    options. Client systems would silently use the server-provided settings
    instead of honoring these options, changing the security model. This
    update includes a fix from Haroldo Gamal that forces the kernel to honor
    these mount options. Note that, since the current versions of smbmount
    always pass values for these options to the kernel, it is not currently
    possible to activate unix extensions by omitting mount options. However,
    this behavior is currently consistent with the current behavior of the
    next Debian release, 'etch'.</p></li>

<p>The following matrix explains which kernel version for which architecture
fix the problems mentioned above:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th></th>                <th>Debian 3.1 (sarge)</th></tr>
<tr><td>Source</td>                      <td>2.4.27-10sarge5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Alpha architecture</td>          <td>2.4.27-10sarge5</td></tr>

<tr><td>Sun Sparc architecture</td>      <td>2.4.27-9sarge5</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The following matrix lists additional packages that were rebuilt for
compatibility with or to take advantage of this update:</p>

<div class="centerdiv"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tr><th></th>                <th>Debian 3.1 (sarge)</th></tr>
<tr><td>fai-kernels</td>                 <td>1.9.1sarge5</td></tr>
<tr><td>kernel-image-2.4.27-speakup</td> <td>2.4.27-1.1sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>mindi-kernel</td>                <td>2.4.27-2sarge4</td></tr>
<tr><td>systemimager</td>                <td>3.2.3-6sarge4</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>
