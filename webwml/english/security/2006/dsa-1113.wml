<p>It was discovered that the Zope web application server allows read access
to arbitrary pages on the server, if a user has the privilege to edit
"restructured text" pages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.5-2sarge2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain Zope 2.7 packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zope2.7 package.</p>
