<p>Jan Braun discovered that the fbgs script of fbi, an image viewer for
the framebuffer environment, creates an directory in a predictable manner,
which allows denial of service through symlink attacks.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.23woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.01-1.2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fbi package.</p>
