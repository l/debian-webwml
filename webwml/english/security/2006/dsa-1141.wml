<p>Evgeny Legerov discovered that overly large comments can crash gnupg,
the GNU privacy guard - a free PGP replacement, which is also present
in the development branch.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.15-6sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg2 package.</p>
