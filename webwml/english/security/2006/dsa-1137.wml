<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Tavis Ormandy of the Google Security Team discovered several problems
in the TIFF library.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following issues:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3459">CVE-2006-3459</a>

    <p>Several stack-buffer overflows have been discovered.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3460">CVE-2006-3460</a>

    <p>A heap overflow vulnerability in the JPEG decoder may overrun a
    buffer with more data than expected.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3461">CVE-2006-3461</a>

    <p>A heap overflow vulnerability in the PixarLog decoder may allow an
    attacker to execute arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3462">CVE-2006-3462</a>

    <p>A heap overflow vulnerability has been discovered in the NeXT RLE
    decoder.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3463">CVE-2006-3463</a>

    <p>An loop was discovered where a 16bit unsigned short was used to
    iterate over a 32bit unsigned value so that the loop would never
    terminate and continue forever.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3464">CVE-2006-3464</a>

    <p>Multiple unchecked arithmetic operations were uncovered, including
    a number of the range checking operations designed to ensure the
    offsets specified in TIFF directories are legitimate.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3465">CVE-2006-3465</a>

    <p>A flaw was also uncovered in libtiffs custom tag support which may
    result in abnormal behaviour, crashes, or potentially arbitrary
    code execution.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.7.2-7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.8.2-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtiff packages.</p>
