<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in Pound, a reverse proxy and
load balancer for HTTP. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-1391">CVE-2005-1391</a>:
     <p>Overly long HTTP Host: headers may trigger a buffer overflow in the
     add_port() function, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary
     code.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3751">CVE-2005-3751</a>:
     <p>HTTP requests with conflicting Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding
     headers could lead to HTTP Request Smuggling Attack, which can be
     exploited to bypass packet filters or poison web caches.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pound packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.8.2-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.9.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pound package.</p>
