<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Xine multimedia library performs insufficient
sanitising of Real streams, which might lead to the execution of arbitrary
code through a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.1-1sarge5.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 1.1.2+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.1.2+dfsg-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xine-lib packages.</p>
