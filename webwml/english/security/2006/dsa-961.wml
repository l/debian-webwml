<define-tag description>buffer overflows</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>"infamous41md" and Chris Evans discovered several heap based buffer
overflows in xpdf which are also present in pdfkit.framework, the
GNUstep framework for rendering PDF content, and which can lead to a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly to the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdfkit.framework
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdfkit.framework package.</p>
