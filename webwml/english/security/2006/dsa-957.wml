<define-tag description>missing shell meta sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Florian Weimer discovered that delegate code in ImageMagick is
vulnerable to shell command injection using specially crafted file
names.  This allows attackers to encode commands inside of graphic
commands.  With some user interaction, this is exploitable through
Gnus and Thunderbird.  This update filters out the '$' character as
well, which was forgotton in the former update.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.4.4.5-1woody8.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.0.6.2-2.6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 6.2.4.5-0.6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your imagemagick packages.</p>
