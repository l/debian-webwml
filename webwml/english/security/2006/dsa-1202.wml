<p><q>cstone</q> and Rich Felker discovered that specially crafted UTF-8 sequences
may lead an out of bands memory write when displayed inside the screen
terminal multiplexer, allowing denial of service and potentially the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.2-4.1sarge1. Due to technical problems with the security
buildd infrastructure this update lacks a build for the Sun Sparc
architecture. It will be released as soon as the problems are resolved.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.3-0.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your screen package.</p>
