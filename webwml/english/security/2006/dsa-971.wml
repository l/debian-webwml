<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>SuSE researchers discovered heap overflow errors in xpdf, the Portable
Document Format (PDF) suite, that can allow attackers to cause a
denial of service by crashing the application or possibly execute
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.00-13.5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 3.01-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your xpdf packages.</p>
