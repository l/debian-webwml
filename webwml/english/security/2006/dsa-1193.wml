<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the X Window System,
which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3467">CVE-2006-3467</a>

    <p>Chris Evan discovered an integer overflow in the code to handle
    PCF fonts, which might lead to denial of service if a malformed
    font is opened.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3739">CVE-2006-3739</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the code to handle
    Adobe Font Metrics might lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-3740">CVE-2006-3740</a>

    <p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in the code to handle
    CMap and CIDFont font data might lead to the execution of arbitrary
    code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-4447">CVE-2006-4447</a>

    <p>The XFree86 initialization code performs insufficient checking of
    the return value of setuid() when dropping privileges, which might
    lead to local privilege escalation.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.3.0.dfsg.1-14sarge2. This release lacks builds for the
Motorola 680x0 architecture, which failed due to diskspace constraints
on the build host. They will be released once this problem has been
resolved.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed
in version 1:1.2.2-1 of libxfont and version 1:1.0.2-9 of xorg-server.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your XFree86 packages.</p>
