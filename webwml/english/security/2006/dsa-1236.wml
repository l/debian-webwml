<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho discovered that enemies-of-carlotta, a simple
manager for mailing lists, does not properly sanitise email addresses
before passing them through to the system shell.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge), this problem has been fixed in version 
1.0.3-1sarge1</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your enemies-of-carlotta package.</p>
