<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>This update corrects the search feature in trac, an enhanced wiki
and issue tracking system for software development projects, which
broke with the last security update.  For completeness please find
below the original advisory text:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Several vulnerabilies have been discovered in trac, an enhanced wiki
and issue tracking system for software development projects.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4065">CVE-2005-4065</a>

    <p>Due to missing input sanitising it is possible to inject arbitrary
    SQL code into the SQL statements.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4644">CVE-2005-4644</a>

    <p>A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered that
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain trac packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8.1-3sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your trac package.</p>
