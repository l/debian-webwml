<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that a script in tuxpaint, a paint program for young
children, creates a temporary file in an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain tuxpaint packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.14-2sarge0.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.15b-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your tuxpaint package.</p>
