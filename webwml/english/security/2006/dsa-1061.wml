<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It has been discovered that popfile, a bayesian mail classifier, can
be forced into a crash through malformed character sets within email
messages, which allows denial of service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain popfile packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.22.2-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.22.4-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your popfile package.</p>
