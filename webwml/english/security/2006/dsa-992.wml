<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Simon Kilvington discovered that specially crafted PNG images can trigger
a heap overflow in libavcodec, the multimedia library of ffmpeg, which may
lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain ffmpeg packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.cvs20050313-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.cvs20050918-5.1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ffmpeg package.</p>
