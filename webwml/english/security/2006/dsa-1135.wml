<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Kevin Kofler discovered several stack-based buffer overflows in the
LookupTRM::lookup function in libtunepimp, a MusicBrainz tagging
library, which allows remote attacers to cause a denial of service or
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.3.0-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.4.2-4.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libtunepimp packages.</p>
