<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Gerald Carter discovered that the smbd daemon from Samba, a free
implementation of the SMB/CIFS protocol, imposes insufficient limits
in the code to handle shared connections, which can be exploited to
exhaust system memory by sending maliciously crafted requests, leading
to denial of service.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.0.14a-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your samba package.</p>
