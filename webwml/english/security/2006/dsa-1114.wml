<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Andreas Seltenreich discovered a buffer overflow in hashcash, a
postage payment scheme for email that is based on hash calculations,
which could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially
crafted entries.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.17-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.21-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hashcash package.</p>
