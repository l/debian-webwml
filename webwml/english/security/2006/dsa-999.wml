<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several security related problems have been discovered in lurker, an
archive tool for mailing lists with integrated search engine.  The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1062">CVE-2006-1062</a>

    <p>Lurker's mechanism for specifying configuration files was
    vulnerable to being overridden.  As lurker includes sections of
    unparsed config files in its output, an attacker could manipulate
    lurker into reading any file readable by the www-data user.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1063">CVE-2006-1063</a>

    <p>It is possible for a remote attacker to create or overwrite files
    in any writable directory that is named "mbox".</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1064">CVE-2006-1064</a>

    <p>Missing input sanitising allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
    web script or HTML.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain lurker packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.2-5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.1-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lurker package.</p>
