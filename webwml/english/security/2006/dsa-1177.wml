<p>Hendrik Weimer discovered that it is possible for a normal user to
disable the login shell of the root account via usermin, a web-based
administration tool.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.110-3.1.</p>

<p>In the upstream distribution this problem is fixed in version 1.220.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your usermin package.</p>
