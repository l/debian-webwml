<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the ClamAV malware
scan engine, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-4182">CVE-2006-4182</a>

    <p>Damian Put discovered a heap overflow error in the script to rebuild
    PE files, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-5295">CVE-2006-5295</a>

    <p>Damian Put discovered that missing input sanitising in the CHM
    handling code might lead to denial of service.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.11. Due to technical problems with the build host
this update lacks a build for the Sparc architecture. It will be
provided soon.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.88.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
