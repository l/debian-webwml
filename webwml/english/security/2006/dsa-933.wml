<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Patrice Fournier found that hylafax passes unsanitized user data in the
notify script, allowing users with the ability to submit jobs to run
arbitrary commands  with the privileges of the hylafax server.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.1.1-4woody1.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.2.1-5sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution the problem has been fixed in version
4.2.4-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hylafax package.</p>
