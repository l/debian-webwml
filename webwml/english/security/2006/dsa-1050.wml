<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammar and an anonymous researcher from Germany discovered a
vulnerability in the protocol code of freshclam, a command line
utility responsible for downloading and installing virus signature
updates for ClamAV, the antivirus scanner for Unix.  This could lead
to a denial of service or potentially the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain clamav packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.84-2.sarge.9.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.88.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your clamav packages.</p>
