<p>A bug has been discovered in several packages that execute the
setuid() system call without checking for success when trying to drop
privileges, which may fail with some PAM configurations.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.3-31sarge8.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0.17-2.</p>
