<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Ulf Härnhammer from the Debian Security Audit Project discovered that unalz, a
decompressor for ALZ archives, performs insufficient bounds checking
when parsing file names.  This can lead to arbitrary code execution if
an attacker provides a crafted ALZ archive.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain unalz.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.30.1</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unalz package.</p>
