<p>Tavis Ormandy noticed that gnupg, the GNU privacy guard - a free PGP
replacement, verifies external signatures of files successfully even
though they don't contain a signature at all.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.6-4woody4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg package.</p>
