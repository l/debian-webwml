<p>Max Vozeler discovered a vulnerability in scponly, a utility to
restrict user commands to scp and sftp, that could lead to the
execution of arbitrary commands as root.  The system is only vulnerable
if the program scponlyc is installed setuid root and if regular users
have shell access to the machine.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an scponly package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.0-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your scponly package.</p>
