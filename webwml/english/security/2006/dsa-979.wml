<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Derek Noonburg has fixed several potential vulnerabilities in xpdf,
the Portable Document Format (PDF) suite, which are also present in
pdfkit.framework, the GNUstep framework for rendering PDF content.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain pdfkit.framework
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.8-2sarge3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) is not affected by these problems.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pdfkit.framework package.</p>
