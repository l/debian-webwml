<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>SuSE researchers discovered heap overflow errors in xpdf, the Portable
Document Format (PDF) suite, which is also present in gpdf, the GNOME
version of the Portable Document Format viewer, and which can allow
attackers to cause a denial of service by crashing the application or
possibly execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain gpdf packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.8.2-1.2sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gpdf package.</p>
