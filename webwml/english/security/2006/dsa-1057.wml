<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been discovered in
phpLDAPadmin, a web based interface for administering LDAP servers,
that allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain phpldapadmin
packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.5-3sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.9.8.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your phpldapadmin package.</p>
