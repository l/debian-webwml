<define-tag description>null dereference</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in racoon
from ipsec-tools, IPsec tools for Linux, try to dereference a NULL
pointer under certain conditions which allows a remote attacker to
cause a denial of service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain ipsec-tools.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5.2-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your racoon package.</p>
