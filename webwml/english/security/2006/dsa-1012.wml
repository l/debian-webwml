<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow in the command line argument parsing has been
discovered in unzip, the de-archiver for ZIP files that could lead to
the execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.50-1woody6.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-1sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 5.52-7.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your unzip package.</p>
