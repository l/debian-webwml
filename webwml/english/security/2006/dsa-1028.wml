<p>Kjetil Kjernsmo discovered a bug in libimager-perl, a Perl extension
for generating 24 bit images, which can lead to a segmentation fault
if it operates on 4-channel JPEG images.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.44-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.50-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libimager-perl package.</p>
