<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Renaud Lifchitz discovered that gv, the PostScript and PDF viewer for X,
performs insufficient boundary checks in the Postscript parsing code,
which allows the execution of arbitrary code through a buffer overflow.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.1-10sarge1.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 3.6.2-2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.6.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gv package.</p>
