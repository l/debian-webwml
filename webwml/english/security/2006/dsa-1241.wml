<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Martijn Brinkers discovered cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in
the mailto parameter of webmail.php, the session and delete_draft
parameters of compose.php and through a shortcoming in the magicHTML
filter. An attacker could abuse these to execute malicious JavaScript in
the user's webmail session. </p>

<p>Also, a workaround was made for Internet Explorer <= 5: IE will attempt
to guess the MIME type of attachments based on content, not the MIME 
header sent. Attachments could fake to be a 'harmless' JPEG, while they
were in fact HTML that Internet Explorer would render.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.4-10.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been fixed
in version 2:1.4.9a-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2:1.4.9a-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your squirrelmail package.</p>
