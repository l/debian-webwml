<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Two vulnerabilities have been discovered in heimdal, a free
implementation of Kerberos 5.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0582">CVE-2006-0582</a>

    <p>Privilege escalation in the rsh server allows an authenticated
    attacker to overwrite arbitrary files and gain ownership of them.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-0677">CVE-2006-0677</a>

    <p>A remote attacker could force the telnet server to crash before
    the user logged in, resulting in inetd turning telnetd off because
    it forked too fast.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not expose rsh and telnet servers.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.6.3-10sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your heimdal packages.</p>
