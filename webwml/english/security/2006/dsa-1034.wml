<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Horde web
application framework, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary 
web script code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1260">CVE-2006-1260</a>

    <p>Null characters in the URL parameter bypass a sanity check, which
    allowed remote attackers to read arbitrary files, which allowed
    information disclosure.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1491">CVE-2006-1491</a>

    <p>User input in the help viewer was passed unsanitised to the eval()
    function, which allowed injection of arbitrary web code.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain horde2 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.8-1sarge2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain horde2 packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde2 package.</p>
