<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Daniel Bleichenbacher discovered a flaw in OpenSSL cryptographic package
that could allow an attacker to generate a forged signature that OpenSSL
will accept as valid.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.7e-3sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.8b-3.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openssl packages.  Note that services
linking against the openssl shared libraries will need to be restarted.
Common examples of such services include most Mail Transport Agents, SSH
servers, and web servers.</p>
