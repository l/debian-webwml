<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL database
server, which may lead to denial of service. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3081">CVE-2006-3081</a>

    <p>"Kanatoko" discovered that the server can be crashed with feeding
    NULL values to the str_to_date() function.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3469">CVE-2006-3469</a>

    <p>Jean-David Maillefer discovered that the server can be crashed with
    specially crafted date_format() function calls.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.1.11a-4sarge5.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain MySQL 4.1
packages. MySQL 5.0 from sid is not affected.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mysql-dfsg-4.1 packages.</p>
