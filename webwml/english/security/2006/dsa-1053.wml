<p>Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott described crashes of Mozilla due to the
use of a deleted controller context.  In theory this could be abused to
execute malicious code.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.7.8-1sarge6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your mozilla packages.</p>
