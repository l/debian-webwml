<define-tag description>insecure temporary file</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that
a cronjob contained in fcheck, a file integrity checker, creates
a temporary file in an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.59-7sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.59-8.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your fcheck package.</p>
