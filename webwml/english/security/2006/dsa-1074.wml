<p>A. Alejandro Hernández discovered a vulnerability in mpg123, a
command-line player for MPEG audio files. Insufficient validation of
MPEG 2.0 layer 3 files results in several buffer overflows.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.59r-20sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.59r-22.</p>
