<p>Stefan Cornelius of Gentoo Security discovered that bomberclone, a
free Bomberman-like game, crashes when receiving overly long error
packets, which may also allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain bomberclone packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11.5-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.11.6.2-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your bomberclone package.</p>
