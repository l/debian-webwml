<p>Javier Fernández-Sanguino Peña from the Debian Security Audit project
discovered that a script in noweb, a web like literate-programming
tool, creates a temporary file in an insecure fashion.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.9a-7.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.10c-3.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nowebm package.</p>
