<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several local and remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux
kernel that may lead to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary
code. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the
following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-0887">CVE-2004-0887</a>

    <p>Martin Schwidefsky discovered that the privileged instruction SACF (Set
    Address Space Control Fast) on the S/390 platform is not handled properly, 
    allowing for a local user to gain root privileges.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-1058">CVE-2004-1058</a>

    <p>A race condition allows for a local user to read the environment variables
    of another process that is still spawning through /proc/.../cmdline.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2004-2607">CVE-2004-2607</a>

    <p>A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer allows local users to read
    portions of kernel memory via a large len argument which is received as an
    int but cast to a short, preventing read loop from filling a buffer.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-0449">CVE-2005-0449</a>
    
    <p>An error in the skb_checksum_help() function from the netfilter framework
    has been discovered that allows the bypass of packet filter rules or
    a denial of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-1761">CVE-2005-1761</a>

    <p>A vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem of the IA-64 architecture can 
    allow local attackers to overwrite kernel memory and crash the kernel.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2457">CVE-2005-2457</a>

    <p>Tim Yamin discovered that insufficient input validation in the compressed
    ISO file system (zisofs) allows a denial of service attack through
    maliciously crafted ISO images.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2555">CVE-2005-2555</a>

    <p>Herbert Xu discovered that the setsockopt() function was not restricted to
    users/processes with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability. This allows attackers to
    manipulate IPSEC policies or initiate a denial of service attack. </p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2709">CVE-2005-2709</a>

    <p>Al Viro discovered a race condition in the /proc handling of network devices.
    A (local) attacker could exploit the stale reference after interface shutdown
    to cause a denial of service or possibly execute code in kernel mode.</p>

<p><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-2973">CVE-2005-2973</a>
 
    <p>Tetsuo Handa discovered that the udp_v6_get_port() function from the IPv6 code
    can be forced into an endless loop, which allows a denial of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3257">CVE-2005-3257</a>

    KDSKBSENT ioctl, which can possibly lead to privilege escalation.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3783">CVE-2005-3783</a>

    <p>The ptrace code using CLONE_THREAD didn't use the thread group ID to
    determine whether the caller is attaching to itself, which allows a denial
    of service attack.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3806">CVE-2005-3806</a>

    <p>Yen Zheng discovered that the IPv6 flow label code modified an incorrect variable,
    which could lead to memory corruption and denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3848">CVE-2005-3848</a>

    <p>Ollie Wild discovered a memory leak in the icmp_push_reply() function, which
    allows denial of service through memory consumption.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3857">CVE-2005-3857</a>

    <p>Chris Wright discovered that excessive allocation of broken file lock leases
    in the VFS layer can exhaust memory and fill up the system logging, which allows
    denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-3858">CVE-2005-3858</a>

    <p>Patrick McHardy discovered a memory leak in the ip6_input_finish() function from
    the IPv6 code, which allows denial of service.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2005-4618">CVE-2005-4618</a>

    <p>Yi Ying discovered that sysctl does not properly enforce the size of a
    buffer, which allows a denial of service attack.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kernel package immediately and reboot
the machine. If you have built a custom kernel from the kernel source
package, you will need to rebuild to take advantage of these fixes.</p>

<p>This update introduces a change in the kernel's binary interface, the affected
kernel packages inside Debian have been rebuilt, if you're running local addons
you'll need to rebuild these as well.</p>
