<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Mehdi Oudad and Kevin Fernandez discovered a buffer overflow in the
ktools library which is used in centericq, a text-mode multi-protocol
instant messenger client, which may lead local or remote attackers to
execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.5.1-1.1woody2.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.20.0-1sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 4.21.0-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your centericq package.</p>
