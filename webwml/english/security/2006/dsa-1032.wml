<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that the Plone content management system lacks security
declarations for three internal classes. This allows manipulation of user
portraits by unprivileged users.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) doesn't contain Plone.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.4-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.2-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your zope-cmfplone package.</p>
