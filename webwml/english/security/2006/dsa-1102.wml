<p>Steve Kemp from the Debian Security Audit project discovered that
pinball, a pinball simulator, can be tricked into loading level
plugins from user-controlled directories without dropping privileges.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain this package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-3sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.1-6.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your pinball package.</p>
