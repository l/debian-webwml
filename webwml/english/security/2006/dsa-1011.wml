<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Debian vserver
support for Linux.  The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project
identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4347">CVE-2005-4347</a>

    <p>Bjørn Steinbrink discovered that the chroot barrier is not set
    correctly with util-vserver which may result in unauthorised
    escapes from a vserver to the host system.</p>

    <p>This vulnerability is limited to the 2.4 kernel patch included in
    kernel-patch-vserver.  The correction to this problem requires
    updating the util-vserver package as well and installing a new
    kernel built from the updated kernel-patch-vserver package.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-4418">CVE-2005-4418</a>

    <p>The default policy of util-vserver is set to trust all unknown
    capabilities instead of considering them as insecure.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a
kernel-patch-vserver package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.9.5.5 of kernel-patch-vserver and in version
0.30.204-5sarge3 of util-vserver.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.3 of kernel-patch-vserver and in version 0.30.208-1 of
util-vserver.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your util-vserver and
kernel-patch-vserver packages and build a new kernel immediately.</p>
