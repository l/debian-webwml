<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Matteo Rosi and Leonardo Maccari discovered that hostapd, a wifi network
authenticator daemon, performs insufficient boundary checks on a key length
value, which might be exploited to crash the service.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain hostapd packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.3.7-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.5-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your hostapd package.</p>
