<p>Michal Zalewski discovered that lynx, the popular text-mode WWW
Browser, is not able to grok invalid HTML including a TEXTAREA tag
with a large COLS value and a large tag name in an element that is not
terminated, and loops forever trying to render the broken HTML.</p>

<p>For the old stable distribution (woody) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.4.1b-3.4.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2sarge2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.8.5-2sarge2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your lynx package.</p>
