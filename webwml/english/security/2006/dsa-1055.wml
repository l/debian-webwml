<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Martijn Wargers and Nick Mott described crashes of Mozilla due to the
use of a deleted controller context.  In theory this could be abused to
execute malicious code.  Since Mozilla and Firefox share the same
codebase, Firefox may be vulnerable as well.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.0.4-2sarge7.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Mozilla Firefox packages.</p>
