<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Squirrelmail, a
commonly used webmail system.  The Common Vulnerabilities and
Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0188">CVE-2006-0188</a>

    <p>Martijn Brinkers and Ben Maurer found a flaw in webmail.php that
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web pages into the right
    frame via a URL in the right_frame parameter.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0195">CVE-2006-0195</a>

    <p>Martijn Brinkers and Scott Hughes discovered an interpretation
    conflict in the MagicHTML filter that allows remote attackers to
    conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via style sheet
    specifiers with invalid (1) "/*" and "*/" comments, or (2) slashes
    inside the "url" keyword, which is processed by some web browsers
    including Internet Explorer.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-0377">CVE-2006-0377</a>

    <p>Vicente Aguilera of Internet Security Auditors, S.L. discovered a
    CRLF injection vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to
    inject arbitrary IMAP commands via newline characters in the mailbox
    parameter of the sqimap_mailbox_select command, aka "IMAP
    injection." There's no known way to exploit this yet.</p></li>
