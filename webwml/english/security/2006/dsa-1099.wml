<define-tag description>missing input sanitising</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Michael Marek discovered that the Horde web application framework performs
insufficient input sanitising, which might lead to the injection of web
script code through cross-site scripting.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain horde3 packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.2.8-1sarge3.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) does no longer contain horde2 packages.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your horde2 package.</p>
