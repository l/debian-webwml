<p>Paul Szabo discovered that the netkit ftp server switches the user id too
late, which may lead to the bypass of access restrictions when running
on NFS. This update also adds return value checks to setuid() calls, which
may fail in some PAM configurations.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17-20sarge2.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) this problem has been
fixed in version 0.17-22.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.17-22.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ftpd package.</p>
