<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in otrs, the Open Ticket
Request System, that can be exploited remotely.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures Project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3893">CVE-2005-3893</a>

    <p>Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to
    execute arbitrary SQL commands and bypass authentication.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3894">CVE-2005-3894</a>

    <p>Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities allow remote
    authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2005-3895">CVE-2005-3895</a>

    <p>Internally attached text/html mails are rendered as HTML when the
    queue moderator attempts to download the attachment, which allows
    remote attackers to execute arbitrary web script or HTML.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain OTRS packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.2p01-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.4p01-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your otrs package.</p>
