<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>In certain application programs packaged in the MIT Kerberos 5 source
distribution, calls to setuid() and seteuid() are not always checked
for success and may fail with some PAM configurations.  A local
user could exploit one of these vulnerabilities to result in privilege
escalation.  No exploit code is known to exist at this time.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.3.6-2sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.3-9.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your krb5 packages.</p>
