<define-tag description>denial of service</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Thomas Reifferscheid discovered that adzapper, a proxy advertisement
zapper add-on, when installed as plugin in squid, the Internet object
cache, can consume a lot of CPU resources and hence cause a denial of
service on the proxy host.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain an adzapper package.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 20050316-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 20060115-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your adzapper package.</p>
