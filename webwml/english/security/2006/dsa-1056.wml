<p>David Maciejak noticed that webcalendar, a PHP-Based multi-user
calendar, returns different error messages on login attempts for an
invalid password and a non-existing user, allowing remote attackers to
gain information about valid usernames.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain a webcalendar package</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.9.45-4sarge4.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your webcalendar package.</p>
