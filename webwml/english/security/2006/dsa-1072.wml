<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>A buffer overflow has been discovered in nagios, a host, service and
network monitoring and management system, that could be exploited by
remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain nagios packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.3-cvs.20050402-2.sarge.2.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4-1 and 2.3-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your nagios package.</p>
