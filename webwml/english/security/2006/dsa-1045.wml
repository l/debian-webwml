<p>Hendrik Weimer discovered that OpenVPN, the Virtual Private Network
daemon, allows to push environment variables to a client allowing a
malicious VPN server to take over connected clients.</p>

<p>the old stable distribution (woody) does not contain openvpn packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0-1sarge3.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.0.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your openvpn package.</p>
