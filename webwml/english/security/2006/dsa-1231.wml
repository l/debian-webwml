<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the GNU privacy guard,
a free PGP replacement, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.
The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6169">CVE-2006-6169</a>

    <p>Werner Koch discovered that a buffer overflow in a sanitising function
    may lead to execution of arbitrary code when running gnupg
    interactively.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2006-6235">CVE-2006-6235</a>

    <p>Tavis Ormandy discovered that parsing a carefully crafted OpenPGP
    packet may lead to the execution of arbitrary code, as a function
    pointer of an internal structure may be controlled through the
    decryption routines.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.1-1.sarge6.</p>

<p>For the upcoming stable distribution (etch) these problems have been
fixed in version 1.4.6-1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 1.4.6-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your gnupg packages.</p>
