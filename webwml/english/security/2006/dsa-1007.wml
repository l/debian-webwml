<define-tag moreinfo>

<p>The Drupal Security Team discovered several vulnerabilities in Drupal,
a fully-featured content management and discussion engine.  The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following
problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1225">CVE-2006-1225</a>

    <p>Due to missing input sanitising a remote attacker could inject
    headers of outgoing e-mail messages and use Drupal as a spam
    proxy.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1226">CVE-2006-1226</a>

    <p>Missing input sanity checks allows attackers to inject arbitrary
    web script or HTML.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1227">CVE-2006-1227</a>

    <p>Menu items created with the menu.module lacked access control,
    which might allow remote attackers to access administrator pages.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-1228">CVE-2006-1228</a>

    <p>Markus Petrux discovered a bug in the session fixation which may
    allow remote attackers to gain Drupal user privileges.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain Drupal packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.3-6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 4.5.8-1.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your drupal package.</p>
