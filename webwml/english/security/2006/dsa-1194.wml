<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>It was discovered that an integer overflow in libwmf, the library to read
Windows Metafile Format files, can be exploited to execute arbitrary code
if a crafted WMF file is parsed.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.3-2sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.2.8.4-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your libwmf package.</p>
