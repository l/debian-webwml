<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Maksim Orlovich discovered that the kjs Javascript interpreter, used
in the Konqueror web browser and in other parts of KDE, performs
insufficient bounds checking when parsing UTF-8 encoded Uniform Resource
Identifiers, which may lead to a heap based buffer overflow and the
execution of arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 3.3.2-6.4</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kdelibs package.</p>
