<p>The Mu Security research team discovered a denial of service condition
in the Simple Authentication and Security Layer authentication library
(SASL) during DIGEST-MD5 negotiation.  This potentially affects
multiple products that use SASL DIGEST-MD5 authentication including
OpenLDAP, Sendmail, Postfix, etc.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) is not affected by this problem.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.19-1.5sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.1.19.dfsg1-0.2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your cyrus-sasl2 packages.</p>
