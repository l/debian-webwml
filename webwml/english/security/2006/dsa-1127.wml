<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Several remote vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Ethereal network
sniffer, which may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. The Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:</p>

<ul>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3628">CVE-2006-3628</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the FW-1 and MQ dissectors are
    vulnerable to format string attacks.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3629">CVE-2006-3629</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the MOUNT dissector is vulnerable
    to denial of service through memory exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3630">CVE-2006-3630</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered off-by-one overflows in the NCP NMAS and
    NDPS dissectors.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3631">CVE-2006-3631</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered a buffer overflow in the NFS dissector.</p></li>

<li><a href="http://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2006-3632">CVE-2006-3632</a>

    <p>Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the SSH dissector is vulnerable
    to denial of service through an infinite loop.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.10.10-2sarge6.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) these problems have been fixed in
version 0.99.2-1 of wireshark, the sniffer formerly known as ethereal.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your ethereal packages.</p>
