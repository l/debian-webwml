<define-tag description>buffer overflow</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>
<p>Marcus Meissner discovered that kaffeine, a versatile media player for
KDE 3, contains an unchecked buffer that can be overwritten remotely
when fetching remote RAM playlists which can cause the execution of
arbitrary code.</p>

<p>The old stable distribution (woody) does not contain kaffeine packages.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 0.6-1sarge1.</p>

<p>For the unstable distribution (sid) this problem will be fixed soon.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your kaffeine package.</p>
