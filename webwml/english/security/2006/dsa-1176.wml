<p>It was discovered that the Zope web application server does not disable
the csv_table directive in web pages containing ReST markup, allowing
the exposure of files readable by the Zope server.</p>

<p>For the stable distribution (sarge) this problem has been fixed in
version 2.7.5-2sarge2.</p>

<p>The unstable distribution (sid) doesn't contain zope2.7 any longer, for
zope2.8 this problem has been fixed in version 2.8.8-2.</p>

<p>We recommend that you upgrade your Zope package.</p>
