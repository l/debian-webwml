<H2>
<P>The site we were using for our search engine has been taken down.
Please be patient as we implement a new searching system<BR>

<P>Update: We are having trouble finding a suitable replacement considering the conditions of the situation:

<OL>
    <LI>Must be DFSG free
    <LI>Must be able to do incremental indexing
    <LI>Must be able to handle the complete website (including bug pages and
    list archives) without eating all our disk space.
    <LI>Must be able to run indexing without eating all of the computers CPU
    cycles
</UL>

<P>We have looked at and ruled out (and this list is not exhaustive):
<UL>
    <LI>htdig
    <LI>swish
    <LI>glimpse
</UL>

<P>At this time, it does not look as if a suitable replacement is available.
In the mean time, try using one of the spidering search sites like altavista
(http://www.altavista.com) or google (http://www.google.com).
