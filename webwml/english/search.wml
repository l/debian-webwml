#use wml::debian::template title="Search"

<P>The site we were using for our search engine has been taken down.
Please be patient as we implement a new searching system<BR>

<P>Update: We are having trouble finding a suitable replacement considering the conditions of the situation:

<OL>
    <LI>Must be DFSG free
    <LI>Must be able to do incremental indexing
    <LI>Must be able to handle the complete website (including bug pages and
    list archives) without eating all our disk space.
    <LI>Must be able to run indexing without eating all of the computers CPU
    cycles
    <LI>Must be able index local files without going through a web server
    <LI>Must be able to handle a site using content negotiation
</OL>

<P>We have looked at and ruled out (and this list is not exhaustive):
<UL>
    <LI><A href="http://www.htdig.org/">htdig</A>
    <LI>swish
    <LI><A href="http://webglimpse.net/">glimpse</A>
</UL>

<P>We are currently looking at the following indexers:
<UL>
    <LI><A href="http://www.best.com/~pjl/software/swish/">swish++</A>
    <LI><A href="http://mysearch.udm.net/">udmsearch</A>
    <LI><A href="http://www.gnu.org/software/idutils/idutils.html">id-utils</A>
    <LI><A href="http://www.senga.org/">Senga</A>
</UL>
<P>All of the ones under evaluation have their drawbacks (if they didn't you
would be using the search function and not reading this).  However, we are
seeing if we can get around those.

<P>At this time, it does not look as if a suitable replacement is available.
In the mean time, try using one of the spidering search sites like 
<A href="http://www.altavista.com/">altavista</A> or 
<A href="http://www.google.com/">google</A>.
    
<P>You can, however, currently search for 
<A href="/distrib/packages">packages</A>, in <A href="/Lists-Archives/#search">
email list archives</A> or for <A href="/Bugs/">bugs</A>.
