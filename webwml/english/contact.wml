<p>Debian is a large organization and there are a lot of ways to contact it.
This page will summarize the often requested means of contacting; it is by
no means inclusive. Please refer to the rest of the web pages for other
contact methods.</p>

<p>English language is the common language for communication with Debian
developers. We therefore ask that initial enquiries to developers be made
in <strong>English</strong>. If this is not possible, go through
<a href="MailingLists/subscribe#int">the user mailing list for your
language</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the information about Debian is collected on our web site,
<a href="$(HOME)">http://www.debian.org/</a>, so please browse and
<a href="$(SEARCH)">search</a> through it before contacting us.

<p>Our <a href="doc/FAQ/">FAQ</a> will answer many of your questions.
You can also get the PostScript, text and packed-up HTML versions of that
document from <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/FAQ/">the FTP site</a>.

<p>Questions regarding the Debian Project in general can be sent to the
<em>debian-project</em> mailing list, at
<a href="mailto:debian-project@lists.debian.org">debian-project@lists.debian.org</a>.
Please don't send questions about using Linux to that list; read on
below for that.

<H2><a name="installuse">Installing and Using Debian</a></H2>

<p>If you are certain the documentation on the installation media and on our
web site doesn't have a solution to your problem, there's a very active user
mailing list where Debian users and developers can answer your questions,
the <em>debian-user</em> mailing list.
All questions regarding
<UL>
  <LI>installation
  <LI>configuration
  <LI>supported hardware
  <LI>machine administration
  <LI>using Debian
</UL>
should be sent to that list.
Simply <a href="MailingLists/subscribe#debian-user">subscribe to
<em>debian-user</em></a> and send your question to
<a href="mailto:debian-user@lists.debian.org">debian-user@lists.debian.org</a>.

<p>Additionally, there are user mailing lists for speakers of various
languages. See the <a href="MailingLists/subscribe#int">subscription info
for international mailing lists</a>.

<p>If you think you've found a bug in our installation system, send
information about it to
<a href="mailto:debian-boot@lists.debian.org">debian-boot@lists.debian.org</a>

<a href="Bugs/Reporting">instructions for filing bug reports</a>.

<p>If you simply want to communicate with the maintainer of a Debian

Any mail sent to &lt;<var>package name</var>&gt;@packages.debian.org will be
forwarded to the maintainer responsible for that package.

problem in a discreet manner, send e-mail to

<p>If you have questions that are more development related, there are
several <a href="MailingLists/subscribe#devel">development mailing lists</a>
in Debian that you can use to contact our developers.

<p>The general development mailing list is <em>debian-devel</em>: you can
<a href="MailingLists/subscribe#debian-devel">subscribe</a> to it and
then send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-devel@lists.debian.org">debian-devel@lists.debian.org</a>.
