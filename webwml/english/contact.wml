<p>Debian is a large organization and there are a lot of ways to contact it.
This page will summarize the often requested means of contacting; it is by
no means inclusive. Please refer to the rest of the web pages for other
contact methods.</p>

<p>
Please note that most of the e-mail addresses below
represent open mailing lists with public archives.
Read the <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/disclaimer">\
disclaimer</a> before sending any messages.
</p>

<p>English language is the common language for communication with Debian
developers. We therefore ask that initial enquiries to developers be made
in <strong>English</strong>. If this is not possible, go through
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/users.html#debian-user">the user mailing list for your
language</a>.</p>

<h2 id="generalinfo">General Information</h2>

<p>Most of the information about Debian is collected on our web site,
<a href="$(HOME)">http://www.debian.org/</a>, so please browse and
<a href="$(SEARCH)">search</a> through it before contacting us.

<p>Our <a href="doc/FAQ/">FAQ</a> will answer many of your questions.
You can also get the PostScript, text and packed-up HTML versions of that
document from <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/FAQ/">the FTP site</a>.

<p>Questions regarding the Debian Project in general can be sent to the
<em>debian-project</em> mailing list, at
<email debian-project@lists.debian.org>.
Please don't send questions about using Linux to that list; read on
below for that.

<h2 id="installuse">Installing and Using Debian</h2>

<p>If you are certain the documentation on the installation media and on our
web site doesn't have a solution to your problem, there's a very active user
mailing list where Debian users and developers can answer your questions,
the <em>debian-user</em> mailing list.
All questions regarding
<ul>
  <li>installation
  <li>configuration
  <li>supported hardware
  <li>machine administration
  <li>using Debian
</ul>
should be sent to that list.
Simply <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/">subscribe to
<em>debian-user</em></a> and send your question to
<email debian-user@lists.debian.org>.

<p>Additionally, there are user mailing lists for speakers of various
languages. See the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/users.html#debian-user">subscription info
for international mailing lists</a>.

<p>Furthermore, you can browse our mailing lists as newsgroups using a web
interface, like <a href="http://groups.google.com/">Google</a> or
<a href="http://gmane.org/">Gmane</a>.

<p>If you think you've found a bug in our installation system, send
information about it to
<email debian-boot@lists.debian.org>
or <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch05s04.html#submit-bug">file a bug report</a> against the <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/debian-installer">debian-installer</a>
pseudo-package.

<h2 id="press">Publicity / Press</h2>

<p>Those requesting information for articles or submitting news for our
news page should contact our <a href="mailto:press@debian.org">publicity
department</a>.

<h2 id="events">Events / Conferences</h2>

<p>Invitations for <a href="$(HOME)/events/">conferences</a> and

<h2 id="packageproblems">Reporting problems in Debian packages</h2>

<p>If you would like to file a bug against a Debian package, we have a bug
tracking system where you can easily report your problem. Please read the
<a href="Bugs/Reporting">instructions for filing bug reports</a>.

<p>If you simply want to communicate with the maintainer of a Debian
package, then you can use the special mail aliases set up for each package.
Any mail sent to &lt;<var>package name</var>&gt;@packages.debian.org will be
forwarded to the maintainer responsible for that package.

<p>If you would like to make the developers aware of a Debian security
problem in a discreet manner, send e-mail to
<email security@debian.org>.

<h2 id="development">Debian Development</h2>

<p>If you have questions that are more development related, there are
several <a href="http://lists.debian.org/devel.html">development mailing lists</a>
in Debian that you can use to contact our developers.

<p>The general development mailing list is <em>debian-devel</em>: you can
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/">subscribe</a> to it and
then send e-mail to
<email debian-devel@lists.debian.org>.

<h2 id="infrastructure">Problems with Debian infrastructure</h2>

<p>To report a problem with a Debian service, you can usually
<a href="Bugs/Reporting">report a bug</a> against the appropriate
