<H2>Debian Development</H2>
<p>Please note that although many developers are not native speakers of English, it is
the common language for all development work. We therefore ask that initial enquiries
to developers be made in English. If this is not possible, go through the user mailing
list for your language.

<p>If you have a more development related question, there is a mailing list the developers
use to communicate with each other.
Simply <a href="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe">subscribe</a> to
<EM>debian-devel</EM> and then send e-mail to
<a href="mailto:debian-devel@lists.debian.org">debian-devel@lists.debian.org</a>.

<p>If you would like to file a bug against a Debian
package, see
<a href="http://www.debian.org/Bugs/">http://www.debian.org/Bugs/</a> or
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/bug-reporting.txt">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/bug-reporting.txt</a>
for instructions. Submitting bugs can be made easier by installing the Debian package, <em>bug</em>.

<p>If you would like to make the developers aware of a Debian security
problem in a discreet manner, send e-mail to
