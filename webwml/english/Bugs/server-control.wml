<h1>Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver</h1>

<p>
Just as <code>request@bugs.debian.org</code> allows the <a
href="server-request">retrieval of bug data and documentation by
email</a>, <code>control@bugs.debian.org</code> allows bug reports to
be manipulated in various ways.
</p>

<p>
The control server works just like the request server, except that it
has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program.  The two
addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and
causing problems while merely trying to request information.
</p>

<p>
Since the commands specific to the control server actually change
the status of a bug, a notification about processing the commands is
sent to the maintainer of the package(s) the changed bugs are assigned
to. Additionally the mail to the server and the resulting changes are
logged in the bug report and thereby available in the WWW pages.
</p>

<p>
Please see the
<a href="server-request#introduction">introduction to the request server</a>
available on the World Wide Web, in the file
<code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>, or by sending
<code>help</code> to either mailserver, for details of the basics of
operating the mailservers and the common commands available when
mailing either address.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="server-refcard">reference card</a> for the
mailservers is available via the WWW, in
<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> or by email using the
<code>refcard</code> command.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a name="reassign"><code>reassign</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>package</var> [ <var>version</var> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Records that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> is a bug in <var>package</var>.
    This can be used to set the package if the user forgot the
    pseudo-header, or to change an earlier assignment.  No notifications
    are sent to anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
    transcript).
    </p>

    <p>
    If you supply a <var>version</var>, the bug tracking system will note
    that the bug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can assign a bug to two packages at once by separating the
      package names with a comma. <em>However</em>, you should only do
      this if the bug can be fixed by a change to <em>either</em>
      package. If this is not the case, you
      should <a href="#clone">clone</a> the bug and reassign the clone
      to the other package.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="reopen"><code>reopen</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
   [ <var>originator-address</var> | <code>=</code> | <code>!</code> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Reopens #<var>bugnumber</var> if it is closed.
    </p>

    <p>
    By default, or if you specify <code>=</code>, the original submitter is
    still as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
    when it is closed again.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you supply an <var>originator-address</var> the originator will be
    set to the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new
    originator of the reopened report you can use the <code>!</code>
    shorthand or specify your own email address.
    </p>

    <p>
    It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
    recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
    they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
    again.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
    change the originator.  To change the originator of an open bug report,
    use the <code>submitter</code> command; note that this will inform the
    original submitter of the change.
    </p>

    <p>
    If the bug was recorded as being closed in a particular version of a
    package but recurred in a later version, it is better to use the
    <code>found</code> command instead.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="found"><code>found</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [
    <var>version</var> ]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Record that #<var>bugnumber</var> has been encountered in the given
    <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.
    <var>version</var> may be a fully qualified version,
    of the form <var>sourcepackagename/version</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction with
    fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display lists of bugs
    open in various versions of each package. It considers a bug to be open
    when it has no fixed version, or when it has been found more recently than
    it has been fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
    If no <var>version</var> is given, then the list of fixed versions for
    the bug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of
    <code>reopen</code>.
    <var>version</var> may be a fully qualified version, of the
    form <var>sourcepackagename/version</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This command will only cause a bug to be marked as not done if no
    version is specified, or if the <var>version</var> being marked
    found is equal to or greater than the highest <var>version</var>
    marked fixed. (If you are certain that you want the bug marked as
    not done, use <code>reopen</code> in conjunction
    with <code>found</code>.)
    </p>

    <p>
    This command was introduced in preference to <code>reopen</code>
    because it was difficult to add a <var>version</var> to that command's
    syntax without suffering ambiguity.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="notfound"><code>notfound</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>version</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Remove the record that #<var>bugnumber</var> was encountered in the
    given <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.
    <var>version</var> may be a fully qualified version, of
    the form <var>sourcepackagename/version</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the bug is not
    listed as fixed in that version either; no information about that version
    will be known. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the record of when a
    bug was found.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="fixed"><code>fixed</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>version</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Indicate that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> was fixed in the given
    <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.
    <var>version</var> may be a fully qualified version, of the
    form <var>sourcepackagename/version</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This does <em>not</em> cause the bug to be marked as closed, it
    merely adds another version in which the bug was fixed. Use the
    bugnumber-done address to close a bug and mark it fixed in a
    particular version.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="notfixed"><code>notfixed</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>version</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Remove the record that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> has been fixed in
    the given <var>version</var>.
    <var>version</var> may be a fully qualified version, of the
    form <var>sourcepackagename/version</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    This command is equivalent to <code>found</code> followed by
    <code>notfound</code> (the found removes the fixed at a particular
    version, and notfound removes the found) with the exception that
    the bug is not reopened if the found version is greater than any
    existing fixed version. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the
    record of when a bug was fixed; in most cases, you actually want
    <code>found</code>, not <code>notfixed</code>.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="submitter"><code>submitter</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>originator-address</var> | <code>!</code></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Changes the originator of #<var>bugnumber</var> to
    <var>originator-address</var>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can use
    the <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.
    </p>

    <p>
    While the <code>reopen</code> command changes the originator of other
    bugs merged with the one being reopened, <code>submitter</code> does not
    affect merged bugs.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="forwarded"><code>forwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>address</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Notes that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to the upstream
    maintainer at <var>address</var>.  This does not actually forward the
    report.  This can be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to
    address, or to record a new one for a bug that wasn't previously noted
    as having been forwarded. <var>address</var> should generally be a
    URI, or possibly an email address. Using a URI where possible
    allows tools to query a remote bug tracking system (such as
    bugzilla) for a bug's status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Example usage:
    </p>

    <pre>
      forwarded 12345 http://bugz.illa.foo/cgi/54321
    </pre>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="notforwarded"><code>notforwarded</code>
    <var>bugnumber</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Forgets any idea that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to any
    upstream maintainer.  If the bug was not recorded as having been
    forwarded then this will do nothing.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="retitle"><code>retitle</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>new-title</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is
    the <code>Subject</code> mail header from the original report).
    Will also change the titles of all bug reports which this bug is
    merged with.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="severity"><code>severity</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>severity</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Set the severity level for bug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
    <var>severity</var>.  No notification is sent to the user who reported
    the bug.
    </p>

    <p>
    Severities are <code>critical</code>, <code>grave</code>,
    <code>serious</code>, <code>important</code>, <code>normal</code>,
    <code>minor</code>, and <code>wishlist</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
    For <a href="Developer#severities">their meanings</a> please
    consult the general developers' documentation for the bug system.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="affects"><code>affects</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
      [ <code>+</code> | <code>-</code> | <code>=</code>
      ] <var>package</var> [ <var>package</var> ... ]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Indicates that a bug affects another package. In the case
      where <var>bugnumber</var> causes breakage in <var>package</var>
      even though the bug is actually present in the package to which
      it is assigned, this causes the bug to be listed by default in
      the package list of <var>package</var>. This should generally be
      used where the bug is severe enough to cause multiple reports
      from users to be assigned to the wrong package.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a name="summary"><code>summary</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
      [<var>message number</var>]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Selects a message to use as a summary of a bug. The first
      non-pseudoheader paragraph of that message is parsed and set as the
      summary of the bug which is displayed on the top of the bug
      report page. This is useful in cases where the original report
      doesn't correctly describe the problem or the bug has many
      messages which make it difficult to identify the actual problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      If <var>message number</var> is not given, clears the
      summary. <var>message number</var> is the message number as
      listed in the bugreport cgi script output.
    </p>
  </dd>
 

  <dt><a name="clone"><code>clone</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>NewID</var>
    [ <var>new IDs</var> ... ]</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report. It is
    useful in the case where a single report actually indicates that multiple
    distinct bugs have occurred. <q><var>New IDs</var></q> are negative numbers,
    separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands to
    refer to the newly duplicated bugs. A new report is generated for each
    new ID.
    </p>

    <p>
    Example usage:
    </p>

    <pre>
          clone 12345 -1 -2
          reassign -1 foo
          retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
          reassign -2 bar
          retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
          severity -2 wishlist
          clone 123456 -3
          reassign -3 foo
          retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
          merge -1 -3
    </pre>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="merge"><code>merge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>bugnumber</var> ...</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Merges two or more bug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
    closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
    bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
    merged reports.
    </p>

    <p>
    Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
    either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
    author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the
    same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
    package to which the bug is assigned), and all of the same severity.
    If they don't start out in the same state you should use
    <code>reassign</code>, <code>reopen</code> and so forth to make sure
    that they are before using <code>merge</code>. Titles are not required
    to match, and will not be affected by the merge. Tags are not required
    to match, either, they will be joined.
    </p>

    <p>
    If any of the bugs listed in a <code>merge</code> command is already
    merged with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
    ones listed will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it
    is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.
    </p>

    <p>
    Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
    WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
    Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
    the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="forcemerge"><code>forcemerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
    <var>bugnumber</var> ...</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Forcibly merges two or more bug reports. The settings of the first
    bug listed which must be equal in a normal merge are assigned to
    the bugs listed next. To avoid typos erroneously merging bugs,
    bugs must be in the same package. See the text above for a
    description of what merging means.
    </p>

    <p>
    Note that this makes it possible to close bugs by merging; you
    are responsible for notifying submitters with an appropriate close
    message if you do this.
    </p>
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="unmerge"><code>unmerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
    Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may have
    been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several others then
    they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
    the bug explicitly named are removed.
    </p>

    <p>
    If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
    separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
    of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
    group.
    </p>

    <p>
    You can only unmerge one report with each <code>unmerge</code>
    command; if you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include
    several <code>unmerge</code> commands in your message.
    </p>
  </dd>

    following, and <code>=</code> means to set the following tags to

    or <code>=</code> change the action for the tags following. The
    default action is adding.

    <p>
    A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
    contrast to mailing <var>bugnumber</var><code>-done@bugs.debian.org</code>) the
    text of the mail which caused the bug to be closed is <strong>not</strong>
    included in that notification.  The maintainer who closes a report
    needs to ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
    who reported the bug knows why it is being closed.
    The use of this command is therefore deprecated. See the
    developer's information about <a href="Developer#closing">how to
    close a bug properly</a>.
    </p>

    The owner of a bug claims responsibility for fixing it.
    This is useful to share out work in cases where a
    package has a team of maintainers.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use the
    <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.

  <dt><a name="noowner"><code>noowner</code> <var>bugnumber</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
    maintainer.  If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do nothing.
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="archive"><code>archive</code> <var>bugnumber</var></a></dt>
  <dd>
    Archives a bug that had been archived at some point in the past
    but is currently not archived if the bug fulfills
    the requirements for archival, ignoring time.
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="unarchive"><code>unarchive</code> <var>bugnumber</var></a></dt>
    <dd>
    Unarchives a bug that was previously archived. Unarchival should
    generally be coupled with reopen and found/fixed as appropriate. Bugs
    that have been unarchived can be archived using archive assuming the
    non-time based archival requirements are met. You should not be
    using unarchive to make trivial changes to archived bugs, such as
    changing the submitter; its primary purpose is to allow for the
    reopening of bugs which have been archived without the
    intervention of BTS administrators.
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="comment"><code>#</code>...</a></dt>
    <dd>
    One-line comment. The <code>#</code> must be at the start of the line.
    The text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to the
    sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to document the
    reasons for your commands.
  </dd>


  <dt><a name="thanks"><code>quit</code></a></dt>
  <dt><code>stop</code></dt>
  <dt><code>thank</code></dt>
  <dt><code>thanks</code></dt>
  <dt><code>thankyou</code></dt>
  <dt><code>thank you</code></dt>
  <dt><code>--</code></dt>
  <!-- #366093, I blame you! -->
  <!-- <dt><code>kthxbye</code></dt> -->
  <!-- See... I documented it! -->
  <dd>
    On a line by itself, in any case, possibly followed by
    whitespace, tells the control server to stop processing the
    message; the remainder of the message can include explanations,
    signatures or anything else, none of it will be detected by the
    control server.
