<h1>Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver</h1>

<P>In addition to the mailserver on <code>request@bugs.debian.org</code>
which allows the retrieval of bug data and documentation by email,
there is another server on <code>control@bugs.debian.org</code> which
also allows bug reports to be manipulated in various ways.</P>

<P>The control server works just like the request server, except that it
has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program.  The two
addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and
causing problems while merely trying to request information.</P>

<P>Please see the
<A href="server-request#introduction">introduction to the request server</A>
available on the World Wide Web, in the file
<code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>, or by sending
<code>help</code> to either mailserver, for details of the basics of
operating the mailservers and the common commands available when
mailing either address.</P>

<P>The <A href="server-refcard">reference card</A> for the
mailservers is available via the WWW, in
<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> or by email using the
<code>refcard</code> command.</P>

<H1>Commands available only at the control mailserver</H1>

<dl>

<dt><code>reassign</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>package</var>
<dd>

Records that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> is a bug in <var>package</var>.
This can be used to set the package if the user forgot the
pseudo-header, or to change an earlier assignment.  No notifications
are sent to anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
transcript).

<dt><code>reopen</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
 [ <var>originator-address</var> | <code>=</code> | <code>!</code> ]
<dd>

Reopens #<var>bugnumber</var> if it is closed.

<p>By default, or if you specify <code>=</code>, the original submitter is
still as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
when it is closed again.</p>

<p>If you supply an <var>originator-address</var> the originator will be
set to the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new
originator of the reopened report you can use the <code>!</code>
shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<p>It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
again.</p>

<p>If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
change the originator.  There is no way to change the originator of an
open bug report (this is deliberate, so that you can't have a bug be
closed and then deleted 28 days later without someone being told about
it).

<dt><code>forwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var>
<dd>

Notes that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to the upstream
maintainer at <var>address</var>.  This does not actually forward the
report.  This can be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to
address, or to record a new one for a bug that wasn't previously noted
as having been forwarded.

<dt><code>notforwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Forgets any idea that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to any
upstream maintainer.  If the bug was not recorded as having been
forwarded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>retitle</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>new-title</var>
<dd>

Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is
the <code>Subject</code> mail header from the original report.

<p>Unlike most of the other bug-manipulation commands when used on one of
a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
individual bug requested, and not all those with which it is merged.

<dt><code>severity</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>severity</var>
<dd>

<p>Set the severity level for bug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
<var>severity</var>.  No notification is sent to the user who reported
the bug.</p>

<p>Severities are <code>critical</code>, <code>grave</code>,
<code>serious</code>, <code>important</code>, <code>normal</code>,
<code>minor</code>, and <code>wishlist</code>.

<p>For <A href="Developer#severities">their meanings</A> please
consult the general developers' documentation for the bug system.

<dt><code>merge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...
<dd>

Merges two or more bug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
merged reports.

<p>Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the
same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
package to which the bug is assigned), and all of the same severity.
If they don't start out in the same state you should use
<code>reassign</code>, <code>reopen</code> and so forth to make sure
that they are before using <code>merge</code>.</p>

<P>If any of the bugs listed in a <code>merge</code> command is already
merged with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
ones listed will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it
is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.</p>

<P>Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.</p>

<P>Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

<dt><code>unmerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may have
been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several others then
they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
the bug explicitly named are removed.

<p>If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
group.</p>

<p>You can only unmerge one report with each <code>unmerge</code>
command; if you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include
several <code>unmerge</code> commands in your message.

<dt><code>tags</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <code>+</code> | <code>-</code> | <code>=</code> ] <var>tag</var>

  <dd>Sets a particular tag for the bug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
  <var>tag</var>. No notification is sent to the user who reported the bug.
  <code>+</code> means adding, <code>-</code> means subtracting, and
  <code>=</code> means ignoring the current tags and setting them afresh.
  The default action is adding. A space is required between the +/-/=
  character and the tag name.

  <p>Available tags currently include <code>patch</code>, <code>wontfix</code>,
  <code>moreinfo</code>, <code>unreproducible</code>, <code>help</code>,
  <code>pending</code>, <code>fixed</code>, <code>security</code>,
  <code>upstream</code>, <code>potato</code>, <code>woody</code> and
  <code>sid</code>.

  <p>For <a href="Developer#tags">their meanings</a> please consult the
  general developers' documentation for the bug system.

<dt><code>close</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Close bug report #<var>bugnumber</var>.

<p>A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
contrast to mailing <var>bugnumber</var><code>-done@bugs</code>) the
text of the mail which caused the bug to be closed is <strong>not</strong>
included in that notification.  The maintainer who closes a report
needs to ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
who reported the bug knows why it is being closed.
The use of this command is therefore deprecated.
