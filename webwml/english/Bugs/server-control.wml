<h1>Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver</h1>

<P>In addition to the mailserver on <code>request@bugs.debian.org</code>
which allows the retrieval of bug data and documentation by email,
there is another server on <code>control@bugs.debian.org</code> which
also allows bug reports to be manipulated in various ways.</P>

<P>The control server works just like the request server, except that it
has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program.  The two
addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and
causing problems while merely trying to request information.</P>

<p>Since the commands specific to the control server actually change
the status of a bug, a notification about processing the commands is
sent to the maintainer of the package(s) the changed bugs are assigned
to. Additionally the mail to the server and the resulting changes are
logged in the bug report and thereby available in the WWW pages.</p>

<P>Please see the
<A href="server-request#introduction">introduction to the request server</A>
available on the World Wide Web, in the file
<code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>, or by sending
<code>help</code> to either mailserver, for details of the basics of
operating the mailservers and the common commands available when
mailing either address.</P>

<P>The <A href="server-refcard">reference card</A> for the
mailservers is available via the WWW, in
<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> or by email using the
<code>refcard</code> command.</P>

<dl>

<dt><code>reassign</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>package</var>
 [ <var>version</var> ]
<dd>

Records that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> is a bug in <var>package</var>.
This can be used to set the package if the user forgot the
pseudo-header, or to change an earlier assignment.  No notifications
are sent to anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
transcript).

<p>If you supply a <var>version</var>, the bug tracking system will note
that the bug affects that version of the newly-assigned package.

<dt><code>reopen</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
 [ <var>originator-address</var> | <code>=</code> | <code>!</code> ]
<dd>

Reopens #<var>bugnumber</var> if it is closed.

<p>By default, or if you specify <code>=</code>, the original submitter is
still as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
when it is closed again.</p>

<p>If you supply an <var>originator-address</var> the originator will be
set to the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new
originator of the reopened report you can use the <code>!</code>
shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<p>It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
again.</p>

<p>If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
change the originator.  To change the originator of an open bug report,
use the <code>submitter</code> command; note that this will inform the
original submitter of the change.

<p>If the bug was recorded as being closed in a particular version of a
package but recurred in a later version, it is better to use the
<code>found</code> command instead.

<dt><code>found</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <var>version</var> ]

<dd>Record that #<var>bugnumber</var> has been encountered in the given
<var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.

<p>The bug tracking system uses this information, in conjunction with
fixed versions recorded when closing bugs, to display lists of bugs
open in various versions of each package. It considers a bug to be open
when it has no fixed version, or when it has been found more recently than
it has been fixed.

<p>If no <var>version</var> is given, then the list of fixed versions for
the bug is cleared. This is identical to the behaviour of
<code>reopen</code>.

<p>This command was introduced in preference to <code>reopen</code>
because it was difficult to add a <var>version</var> to that command's
syntax without suffering ambiguity.

<dt><code>notfound</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>version</var>

<dd>Remove the record that #<var>bugnumber</var> was encountered in the
given <var>version</var> of the package to which it is assigned.

<p>This differs from closing the bug at that version in that the bug is not
listed as fixed in that version either; no information about that version
will be known. It is intended for fixing mistakes in the record of when a
bug was found.

<dt><code>submitter</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<var>originator-address</var> | <code>!</code>
<dd>

Changes the originator of #<var>bugnumber</var> to
<var>originator-address</var>.

<p>If you wish to become the new originator of the report you can use
the <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<p>While the <code>reopen</code> command changes the originator of other
bugs merged with the one being reopened, <code>submitter</code> does not
affect merged bugs.</p>

<dt><code>forwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var>
<dd>

Notes that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to the upstream
maintainer at <var>address</var>.  This does not actually forward the
report.  This can be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to
address, or to record a new one for a bug that wasn't previously noted
as having been forwarded.

<dt><code>notforwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Forgets any idea that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to any
upstream maintainer.  If the bug was not recorded as having been
forwarded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>retitle</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>new-title</var>
<dd>

Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is
the <code>Subject</code> mail header from the original report).

<p>Unlike most of the other bug-manipulation commands when used on one of
a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
individual bug requested, and not all those with which it is merged.

<dt><code>severity</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>severity</var>
<dd>

<p>Set the severity level for bug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
<var>severity</var>.  No notification is sent to the user who reported
the bug.</p>

<p>Severities are <code>critical</code>, <code>grave</code>,
<code>serious</code>, <code>important</code>, <code>normal</code>,
<code>minor</code>, and <code>wishlist</code>.

<p>For <A href="Developer#severities">their meanings</A> please
consult the general developers' documentation for the bug system.

<dt><code>clone</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>NewID</var> [ <var>new IDs</var> ... ]

  <dd>The clone control command allows you to duplicate a bug report. It is
  useful in the case where a single report actually indicates that multiple
  distinct bugs have occurred. "<var>New IDs</var>" are negative numbers,
  separated by spaces, which may be used in subsequent control commands to
  refer to the newly duplicated bugs. A new report is generated for each
  new ID.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        clone 12345 -1 -2
        reassign -1 foo
        retitle -1 foo: foo sucks
        reassign -2 bar
        retitle -2 bar: bar sucks when used with foo
        severity -2 wishlist
        clone 123456 -3
        reassign -3 foo
        retitle -3 foo: foo sucks
        merge -1 -3
  </pre>

<dt><code>merge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...
<dd>

Merges two or more bug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
merged reports.

<p>Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
author address or all not marked as forwarded, all assigned to the
same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
package to which the bug is assigned), and all of the same severity.
If they don't start out in the same state you should use
<code>reassign</code>, <code>reopen</code> and so forth to make sure
that they are before using <code>merge</code>. Titles are not required
to match, and will not be affected by the merge. Tags are not required
to match, either, they will be joined.</p>

<P>If any of the bugs listed in a <code>merge</code> command is already
merged with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
ones listed will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it
is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.</p>

<P>Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.</p>

<P>Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

<dt><code>forcemerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...</dt>
  <dd>Forcibly merges two or more bug reports. The first bug is
  chosen as the master bug, and its settings are assigned to the bugs
  listed next in the command. See the text above for a description of
  what merging means.</dd>

<dt><code>unmerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may have
been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several others then
they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
the bug explicitly named are removed.

<p>If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
group.</p>

<p>You can only unmerge one report with each <code>unmerge</code>
command; if you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include
several <code>unmerge</code> commands in your message.

<dt><code>tags</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <code>+</code> | <code>-</code> | <code>=</code> ] <var>tag</var> [ <var>tag</var> ... ]

  <dd>Sets tags for the bug report #<var>bugnumber</var>. No notification
  is sent to the user who reported the bug. Setting the action to
  <code>+</code> means to add each given <var>tag</var>, <code>-</code>
  means to remove each given <var>tag</var>, and <code>=</code> means to
  ignore the current tags and set them afresh to the list provided. The
  default action is adding.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        \# same as 'tags 123456 + patch'
        tags 123456 patch

        \# same as 'tags 123456 + help security'
        tags 123456 help security

        \# add 'fixed' and 'pending' tags
        tags 123456 + fixed pending

        \# remove 'unreproducible' tag
        tags 123456 - unreproducible

        \# set tags to exactly 'moreinfo' and 'unreproducible'
        tags 123456 = moreinfo unreproducible
  </pre>

  <p>Available tags currently include <code>patch</code>, <code>wontfix</code>,
  <code>moreinfo</code>, <code>unreproducible</code>, <code>help</code>,
  <code>pending</code>, <code>fixed</code>,
  <code>fixed-in-experimental</code>, <code>fixed-upstream</code>,
  <code>security</code>, 
  <code>upstream</code>, <code>confirmed</code>, <code>d-i</code>,
  <code>ipv6</code>, <code>lfs</code>, <code>l10n</code>,
  <code>potato</code>, <code>woody</code>, <code>sarge</code>,
  <code>sarge-ignore</code>, <code>etch</code>, <code>etch-ignore</code>,
  <code>sid</code>, and <code>experimental</code>.

  general developers' documentation for the bug system.

<dt><code>close</code> <var>bugnumber</var> [ <var>fixed-version</var> ]
 (deprecated)
<dd>

Close bug report #<var>bugnumber</var>.

<p>A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
contrast to mailing <var>bugnumber</var><code>-done@bugs.debian.org</code>) the
text of the mail which caused the bug to be closed is <strong>not</strong>
included in that notification.  The maintainer who closes a report
needs to ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
who reported the bug knows why it is being closed.
The use of this command is therefore deprecated. See the
developer's information about <a href="Developer#closing">how to
close a bug properly</a>.

<p>If you supply a <var>fixed-version</var>, the bug tracking system
will note that the bug was fixed in that version of the package.

<dt><code>package</code> [ <var>packagename</var> ... ]

  <dd>Limits the following commands so that they will only apply to bugs
  filed against the listed packages. You can list one or more packages. If
  you don't list any packages, the following commands will apply to all
  bugs. You're encouraged to use this as a safety feature in case you
  accidentally use the wrong bug numbers.

  <p>Example usage:</p>

  <pre>
        package foo
        reassign 123456 bar 1.0-1

        package bar
        retitle 123456 bar: bar sucks
        severity 123456 normal

        package
        severity 234567 wishlist
  </pre>

<dt><code>owner</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var> | <code>!</code>

  <dd>Sets <var>address</var> to be the "owner" of #<var>bugnumber</var>.
  The owner of a bug claims responsibility for fixing it and will receive
  all mail regarding it.  This is useful to share out work in cases where a
  package has a team of maintainers.

  <p>If you wish to become the owner of the bug yourself, you can use the
  <code>!</code> shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<dt><code>noowner</code> <var>bugnumber</var>

  <dd>Forgets any idea that the bug has an owner other than the usual
  maintainer.  If the bug had no owner recorded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>#</code>...

  <dd>One-line comment. The <code>#</code> must be at the start of the line.
  The text of comments will be included in the acknowledgement sent to the
  sender and to affected maintainers, so you can use this to document the
  reasons for your commands.

<dt><code>quit</code>
<dt><code>stop</code>
<dt><code>thank</code>...
<dt><code>--</code>...

  <dd>Tells the control server to stop processing the message; the remainder
      of the message can include explanations, signatures or anything else,
      none of it will be detected by the control server.
