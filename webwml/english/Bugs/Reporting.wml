<h1>How to report a bug in Debian</h1>

<h2>Important things to note <strong>before</strong> sending</h2>

<p>Please don't report several unrelated bugs - especially ones in
different packages - in a single bug report.

<p>You should check if your bug report has already been filed by someone
else before submitting it. Lists of currently outstanding bugs are available
<a href="./">on the World Wide Web</a> and <a href="Access">elsewhere</a>
- see other documents for details. You can submit your comments to an
existing bug report #<var>&lt;number&gt;</var> by sending e-mail to
<var>&lt;number&gt;</var>@bugs.debian.org</p>

<p>If you can't seem to determine which package contains the problem,
please send e-mail to the <a href="mailto:debian-user@lists.debian.org">
Debian user mailing list</a> asking for advice. If your problem doesn't
relate just to one package but some general Debian service, there are
several <a href="pseudo-packages">pseudo-packages</a> or even
<a href="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</a> that you can use
to relay your message to us instead.

<p>If you'd like to send a copy of your bug report to additional recipients
(such as mailing lists), you shouldn't use the usual e-mail headers, but
<a href="#xcc">a different method, described below</a>.</p>


<h2>Sending the bug report using an automatic bug report tool</h2>

<p>There is a program that we have developed in Debian to help reporting
bug reports, it's called
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/reportbug.html">reportbug</a></code>.
It will guide you through the bug reporting process step by step,
and probably ease filing bugs that way.</p>

<p>Emacs users can also use the debian-bug command provided by the
<code><a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/utils/debbugs-el.html">\
debbugs-el</a></code> package. When called with <kbd>M-x
debian-bug</kbd>, it will ask for all necessary information in a
similar way to <code>reportbug</code>.</p>


<h2>Sending the bug report via e-mail</h2>

<P>Send email to
<A href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org"><code>submit@bugs.debian.org</code></A>,
as described below.</P>

<P>Of course, like any email, you should include a clear, descriptive
<code>Subject</code> line in your main mail header.  The subject you
give will be used as the initial bug title in the tracking system, so
please try to make it informative!</P>

<p>You need to put a <a name="pseudoheader">pseudo-header</a> at the
start of the body of the
message. That means that the first line of the message body should say:

<pre>
Package: &lt;something&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;something&gt;</code> with the name of the package which
has the bug.

<p>The second line of the message should say:

<pre>
Version: &lt;something&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace <code>&lt;something&gt;</code> with the version of the package.

<p>You need to supply a correct <code>Package</code> line in the
pseudo-header in order for the bug tracking system to deliver the message
to the package's maintainer. See <a href="#findpkgver">this example</a> for
information on how to find this information.

<p>The pseudo-header fields should start at the very start of their lines.</p>

<p>Please include in your report:

<ul>
<li>The <em>exact</em> and <em>complete</em> text of any error
messages printed or logged.  This is very important!
<li>Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
<li>A description of the incorrect behaviour: exactly what behaviour
you were expecting, and what you observed.  A transcript of an
example session is a good way of showing this.
<li>A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
<li>Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
Include the complete text of its configuration files.
<li>The versions of any packages on which the buggy package depends.
<li>What kernel version you're using (type <code>uname -a</code>), your
shared C library (type <code>ls -l /lib/libc.so.6</code> or
<code>dpkg -s libc6 | grep ^Version</code>), and any other details about
your Debian system, if it seems appropriate.  For example, if you had a
problem with a Perl script, you would want to provide the version of the
`perl' binary (type <code>perl -v</code> or <code>dpkg -s perl | grep
^Version:</code>).
<li>Appropriate details of the hardware in your system.  If you're
reporting a problem with a device driver please list <em>all</em> the
hardware in your system, as problems are often caused by IRQ and I/O
address conflicts.
</ul>

<P>Include any detail that seems relevant - you are in very little danger
of making your report too long by including too much information.  If
they are small please include in your report any files you were using
to reproduce the problem (uuencoding them if they may contain odd
characters etc.).</P>

<p>For more advice on how to help the developers solve your problem,
please read <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">
How to Report Bugs Effectively</a>.</p>


<h2><A name="example">Example</A></h2>

<P>A bug report, with mail header, looks something like this:

<PRE>
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org
  From: diligent@testing.linux.org
  Subject: Hello says `goodbye'

  Package: hello
  Version: 1.3-16

  When I invoke `hello' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', rather than the expected `hello, world'.
  Here is a transcript:

  $ hello
  goodbye
  $ /usr/bin/hello
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the output string, in hello.c, be corrected.

  I am using Debian GNU/Linux 2.2, kernel 2.2.17-pre-patch-13
  and libc6 2.1.3-10.
</PRE>


<h2><A name="xcc">Sending copies of bug reports to other addresses</A></h2>

<P>Sometimes it is necessary to send a copy of a bug report to somewhere
else besides <code>debian-bugs-dist</code> and the package maintainer,
which is where they are normally sent.</P>

<P>You could do this by CC'ing your bug report to the other address(es),
but then the other copies would not have the bug report number put in
the <code>Reply-To</code> field and the <code>Subject</code> line.
When the recipients reply they will probably preserve the
<code>submit@bugs.debian.org</code> entry in the header and have their
message filed as a new bug report.  This leads to many duplicated
reports.</P>

<P>The <em>right</em> way to do this is to use the
<code>X-Debbugs-CC</code> header.  Add a line like this to your
message's mail header (<strong>not</strong> to the pseudo header with the
<code>Package</code> field):</P>
<pre>
 X-Debbugs-CC: other-list@cosmic.edu
</pre>
<P>This will cause the bug tracking system to send a copy of your report
to the address(es) in the <code>X-Debbugs-CC</code> line as well as to
<code>debian-bugs-dist</code>.</P>

<P>This feature can often be combined usefully with mailing
<code>quiet</code> - see below.</P>


<h2><A name="severities">Severity levels</A></h2>

<P>If a report is of a particularly serious bug, or is merely a feature
request that, you can set the severity level of the bug as you report
it.  This is not required, however, and the developers will assign an
appropriate severity level to your report if you do not.</P>

<p>To assign a severity level, put a line like this one in the
<a href="#pseudoheader">pseudo-header</a>:</p>

<pre>
Severity: &lt;<var>severity</var>&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace &lt;<var>severity</var>&gt; with one of the available severity
levels, as described in the
<A href="Developer#severities">developers' documentation</A>.</P>


<h2><a name="tags">Assigning tags</a></h2>

<p>You can set tags on a bug as you are reporting it. For example, if
you are including a patch with your bug report, you may wish to set the
<code>patch</code> tag. This is not required, however, and the developers
will set tags on your report as and when it is appropriate.</p>

<p>To set tags, put a line like this one in the
<a href="#pseudoheader">pseudo-header</a>:</p>

<pre>
Tags: &lt;<var>tags</var>&gt;
</pre>

<p>Replace &lt;<var>tags</var>&gt; with one or more of the available tags,
as described in the
<a href="Developer#tags">developers' documentation</a>.
Separate multiple tags with commas, spaces, or both.</p>


<h2>Different submission addresses (minor or mass bug reports)</h2>

<p>If a bug report is minor, for example, a documentation typo or a trivial
build problem, please adjust the severity appropriately and send it to
<code>maintonly@bugs</code> instead of <code>submit@bugs</code>.
<code>maintonly</code> will forward the report to the package maintainer
only, it won't forward it to the BTS mailing lists.

<p>If you're submitting many reports at once, you should definitely use
<code>maintonly@bugs</code> so that you don't cause too much redundant
traffic on the BTS mailing lists. Before submitting many similar bugs you
may also want to post a summary on <code>debian-bugs-dist</code>.

<p>If wish to report a bug to the bug tracking system that's already been
sent to the maintainer, you can use <code>quiet@bugs</code>. Bugs sent to
<code>quiet@bugs</code> will not be forward anywhere, only filed.

<p>When you use different submission addresses, the bug tracking system will
set the <code>Reply-To</code> of any forwarded message so that the replies
will by default be processed in the same way as the original report. That
means that, for example, replies to <code>maintonly</code> will go to
<var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly@bugs</code> instead of
<var>nnn</var><code>@bugs</code>, unless of course one overrides this
manually.


<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Normally, the bug tracking system will return an acknowledgement to you
by e-mail when you report a new bug or submit additional information to an
existing bug. If you want to suppress this acknowledgement, include an
<code>X-Debbugs-No-Ack</code> header in your e-mail (the contents of this
header do not matter; however, it must be in the mail header and
<em>not</em> in the pseudo-header with the <code>Package</code> field). If
you report a new bug with this header, you will need to check the web
interface yourself to find the bug number.</p>

<p>Note that this header will not suppress acknowledgements from the
<code>control@bugs</code> mailserver, since those acknowledgements may
contain error messages which should be read and acted upon.</p>


<h2>Bug reports against unknown packages</h2>

<P>If the bug tracking system doesn't know who the maintainer of the
relevant package is it'll forward the report to
<code>debian-bugs-dist</code> even if <code>maintonly</code> was used.</P>

<P>When sending to <code>maintonly@bugs</code> or
<var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly@bugs</code> you should make sure that
the bug report is assigned to the right package, by putting a correct
<code>Package</code> at the top of an original submission of a report,
or by using <A href="server-control">the
<code>control@bugs</code> service</A> to (re)assign the report
appropriately first if it isn't correct already.</P>


<h2><a name="findpkgver">Using <code>dpkg</code> to find the package and
version for the report</a></h2>

<P>If you are reporting a bug in a command, you can find out which
package installed it by using <code>dpkg --search</code>.  You can
find out which version of a package you have installed by using
<code>dpkg --list</code> or <code>dpkg --status</code>.
</P>

<P>For example:
<pre>
$ which apt-get
/usr/bin/apt-get
$ type apt-get
apt-get is /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --search /usr/bin/apt-get
apt: /usr/bin/apt-get
$ dpkg --list apt
