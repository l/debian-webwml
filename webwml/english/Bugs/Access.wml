<h1>Methods of accessing the bug tracking system logs</h1>

<h2>Accessing active bug reports</h2>

<P>Each message received at or sent by the bug processing system is
logged and made available in a number of ways.</P>

<p>The primary access method is to to use the web pages. See the
forms at the <a href="./">main BTS page</a>.

<P>There is a <A href="server-request">mailserver</A> which can send
bug reports as plain text on request.  To use it send the word
<code>help</code> as the sole contents of an email to
<code>request@bugs.debian.org</code> (the <code>Subject</code> of the
message is ignored), or read the instructions <a href="server-request">on
the World Wide Web</a> or in the file <code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>.

<h2>Accessing archived bug reports</h2>

<p>Each closed bug report is archived 28 days after the last message
relating to it is received and filed. This means that it is no longer
possible to access it or change anything about it using the
<code>control</code> and <code>service</code> bots. However, the
reports are still accessible for viewing.

<p>You can search the bug report archive using the <a href="./">WWW
forms</a>, simply select the "archived bugs" option.

<p>Note that it doesn't contain the oldest closed bug reports, only those
after #40000, approximately.
