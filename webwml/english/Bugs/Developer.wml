#use wml::debian::template title="Debian bug tracking system" NOHEADER=yes

<H1><A name="developers">Developers' information regarding the bug processing system</A></H1>

<P>Initially, a bug report is submitted by a user as an ordinary mail
message to <CODE>submit@bugs.debian.org</CODE>.  This will then be
given a number, acknowledged to the user, and forwarded to
<CODE>debian-bugs-dist</CODE>.  If the submitter included a
<CODE>Package</CODE> line listing a package with a known maintainer
the maintainer will get a copy too.</P>

<P>The <CODE>Subject</CODE> line will have
<CODE>Bug#</CODE><VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>:</CODE> added, and the
<CODE>Reply-To</CODE> will be set to include both the submitter of the
report and <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>@bugs.debian.org</CODE>.</P>


<H2>Closing bug reports</H2>

<P>A developer who receives a bug from the tracking system, or sees it on
<CODE>debian-bugs-dist</CODE>, and takes
responsibility for it should hit Reply in their favourite mailreader,
and then edit the <CODE>To</CODE> field to say
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-done@bugs.debian.org</CODE> instead of
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>@bugs</CODE>
(<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-close</CODE> is provided as an alias for
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-done</CODE>).</P>

<P>The address of the original submitter of the bug report will be
included in the default <CODE>To</CODE> field, because the bug system
included it in the <CODE>Reply-To</CODE>.</P>

<P>`Done' messages are automatically forwarded only to the
<CODE>debian-bugs-closed</CODE> mailing list. If the other developers
are likely to be interested, it may be worthwhile including the
<CODE>debian-devel@lists.debian.org</CODE> mailing list.</P>

<P>The person closing the bug and the person who submitted it will each
get a notification about the change in status of the report.</P>


<H2>Followup messages</H2>

<P>If a developer wishes to reply to a bug report they may simply reply to
the message (that will <b>not</b> mark the bug as done). Their reply will
(by default, if they respect the Reply-To: header) go to
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>@bugs</CODE>, and to the original submitter of the bug
report (note: this is two distinct addresses). The bug tracking system will
receive the message at <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>@bugs</CODE>, pass it on to the
package maintainer, file the reply with the rest of the logs for that bug
report and forward it to <CODE>debian-bugs-dist</CODE>.</P>

<P>A developer may explicitly mail the bug's submitter with an email to
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-submitter@bugs</CODE>.</P>

<P>If you wish to send a followup message which is not appropriate for
<CODE>debian-bugs-dist</CODE> you can do so by sending it to
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-quiet@bugs</CODE> or
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-maintonly@bugs</CODE>.
Mail to <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-quiet@bugs</CODE> is filed in the Bug Tracking
System but is not delivered to any individuals or mailing lists.  Mail to
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-maintonly@bugs</CODE> is filed in the Bug Tracking
System and is delivered only to the maintainer of the package in question.</P>

<P>Do <EM>not</EM> use the `reply to all recipients' or `followup'
feature of your mailer unless you intend to edit down the recipients
substantially.  In particular, see that you don't send followup messages
to <CODE>submit@bugs.debian.org</CODE>.</P>


<H2><A name="severities">Severity levels</A></H2>

<P>The bug system records a severity level with each bug report.  This is
set to <CODE>normal</CODE> by default, but can be overridden either by
supplying a <CODE>Severity</CODE> line in the pseudo-header when the
bug is submitted (see the
<A href="Reporting#pseudoheader">instructions for reporting
bugs</A>), or by using the <CODE>severity</CODE> command with the
<A href="#requestserv">control request server</A>.</P>

<P>The severity levels are:

<DL>
<DT><CODE>critical</CODE>
<DD>makes unrelated software on the system (or the whole system)
break, or causes serious data loss, or introduces a security hole on
systems where you install the package.

<DT><CODE>grave</CODE>
<DD>makes the package in question unuseable or mostly so, or causes
data loss, or introduces a security hole allowing access to the
accounts of users who use the package.

<DT><CODE>important</CODE>
<DD>any other bug which makes the package unsuitable for release.

<DT><CODE>normal</CODE>
<DD>the default value, for normal bugs.
 
<DT><CODE>minor</CODE>
<DD>a minor bug, presumably trivial to fix.

<DT><CODE>wishlist</CODE>
<DD>for any feature request, and also for any bugs that are
very difficult to fix due to major design considerations.

<DT><CODE>fixed</CODE>
<DD>for bugs that are fixed but should not yet be closed.
Bugs fixed by non-maintainer-uploads have their severity set to fixed.
</DL>

<H2><a name="tags">Tags for bug reports</a></H2>

<p>Each bug can have zero or more of a set of given tags. These tags are
displayed in the list of bugs when you look at a package's page, and when
you look at the full bug log.

<p>Tags can be set by supplying a <code>Tags</code> line in the
pseudo-header when the bug is submitted (see the
<a href="Reporting#pseudoheader">instructions for reporting bugs</a>),
or by using the <code>tags</code> command with the
<a href="#requestserv">control request server</a>.

<p>The current bug tags are:

<dl>

<dt><code>patch</code>
  <dd>A patch or some other easy procedure for fixing the bug is included in
  the bug logs. If there's a patch, but it doesn't resolve the bug
  adequately or causes some other problems, this tag should not be used.

<dt><code>wontfix</code>
  <dd>This bug won't be fixed. Possibly because this is a choice between two
  arbitrary ways of doing things and the maintainer and submitter prefer
  different ways of doing things, possibly because changing the behaviour
  will cause other, worse, problems for others, or possibly for other
  reasons.

<dt><code>moreinfo</code>
  <dd>This bug can't be addressed until more information is provided by the
  submitter. The bug will be closed if the submitter doesn't provide more
  information in a reasonable (few months) timeframe. This is for bugs like
  "It doesn't work". What doesn't work?

<dt><code>unreproducible</code>
  <dd>This bug can't be reproduced on the maintainer's system.  Assistance
  from third parties is needed in diagnosing the cause of the problem.

<dt><code>fixed</code>
  <dd>This bug is fixed or worked around, but there's still an issue that
  needs to be resolved. (This will eventually replace the "fixed" severity)

<dt><code>security</code>
  <dd>This bug describes a security problem in a package (e.g., bad
  permissions allowing access to data that shouldn't be accessible; buffer
  overruns allowing people to control a system in ways they shouldn't be
  able to; denial of service attacks that should be fixed, etc). Most
  security bugs should also be set at critical or grave severity.

<dt><code>potato</code>
  <dd>This bug particularly applies to the potato release of Debian.

<dt><code>woody</code>
  <dd>This bug particularly applies to the (unreleased) woody distribution.

<dt><code>sid</code>
  <dd>This bug particularly applies to an architecture that is currently
  unreleased (that is, in the sid distribution).
</dl>

<p>The latter three tags are intended to be used mainly for release critical
bugs, for which it's important to know which distributions are affected to
make sure fixes (or removals) happen in the right place.

<H2><A name="forward">Recording that you have passed on a bug report</A></H2>

<P>When a developer forwards a bug report to the developer of the
upstream source package from which the Debian package is derived,
they should note this in the bug tracking system as follows:</P>

<P>Make sure that the <CODE>To</CODE> field of your message to the author
to has only the author(s) address(es) in it; put both the person who
reported the bug and
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-forwarded@bugs.debian.org</CODE> in the
<CODE>CC</CODE> field.</P>

<P>Ask the author to preserve the <CODE>CC</CODE> to
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-forwarded@bugs</CODE> when they reply, so that
the bug tracking system will file their reply with the original
report.</P>

<P>When the bug tracking system gets a message at
<VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-forwarded</CODE> it will mark the relevant bug as
having been forwarded to the address(es) in the <CODE>To</CODE> field
of the message it gets.</P>

<P>You can also manipulate the `forwarded to' information by sending
messages to <A href="server-control"><CODE>control@bugs.debian.org</CODE></A>.</P>


<H2>Summary postings to <CODE>debian-bugs-reports</CODE></H2>

<P>Every Friday a list of outstanding bug reports is posted to
<CODE>debian-bugs-reports</CODE>, sorted by age of report.
Every Tuesday a list of bug reports that have gone unanswered too long
is posted, sorted by package maintainer.</P>

<P><A name="maintincorrect">\
If the maintainer of a package is listed incorrectly</A>, this is
usually because the maintainer has changed recently, and the new
maintainer hasn't yet uploaded a new version of the package with a
changed <CODE>Maintainer</CODE> control file field.  This will be
fixed when the package is uploaded; alternatively, there is an
override file which the distribution maintainers can edit to record
the change in maintainer, for example if a rebuild and reupload of the
package is not expected to be needed soon.  Contact
<CODE>override-change@debian.org</CODE> for changes to the
override file.</P>


<H2><A name="requestserv">Reopening, reassigning and manipulating bugs</A></H2>

<P>It is possible to reassign bug reports to other packages, to reopen
erroneously-closed ones, to modify the information saying to where, if
anywhere, a bug report has been forwarded, to change the severities
and titles of reports and to merge and unmerge bug reports.  This is
done by sending mail to <CODE>control@bugs.debian.org</CODE>.</P>

<P>The <A href="server-control">format of these messages</A> is
described in another document available on the World Wide Web or in
the file <CODE>bug-maint-mailcontrol.txt</CODE>.  A plain text version
can also be obtained by mailing the word <CODE>help</CODE> to the
server at the address above.</P>


<H2>More-or-less obsolete subject-scanning feature</H2>

<P>Messages that arrive at <CODE>submit</CODE> or <CODE>bugs</CODE> whose
Subject starts <CODE>Bug#</CODE><VAR>nnn</VAR> will be treated as
having been sent to <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>@bugs</CODE>.  This is both
for backwards compatibility with mail forwarded from the old
addresses, and to catch followup mail sent to <CODE>submit</CODE> by
mistake (for example, by using reply to all recipients).</P>

<P>A similar scheme operates for <CODE>maintonly</CODE>,
<CODE>done</CODE>, <CODE>quiet</CODE> and <CODE>forwarded</CODE>,
which treat mail arriving with a Subject tag as having been sent to
the corresponding <VAR>nnn-whatever</VAR><CODE>@bugs</CODE> address.</P>

<P>Messages arriving at plain <CODE>forwarded</CODE> and
<CODE>done</CODE> - ie, with no bug report number in the address - and
without a bug number in the Subject will be filed under `junk' and
kept for a few weeks, but otherwise ignored.</P>

<H2>Obsolete <CODE>X-Debian-PR: quiet</CODE> feature</H2>

<P>It used to be possible to prevent the bug tracking system from
forwarding anywhere messages it received at <CODE>debian-bugs</CODE>,
by putting an <CODE>X-Debian-PR: quiet</CODE> line in the actual mail
header.</P>

<P>This header line is now ignored.  Instead, send your message to
<CODE>quiet</CODE> or <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-quiet</CODE> (or
<CODE>maintonly</CODE> or <VAR>nnn</VAR><CODE>-maintonly</CODE>).</P>
