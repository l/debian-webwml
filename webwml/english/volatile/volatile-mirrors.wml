<h1>Debian-volatile worldwide mirror sites</h1>

<p>
Debian-volatile is distributed (<em>mirrored</em>) on several
servers on the Internet. Using a nearby server will probably speed up your
download, and also reduce the load on our central servers and on the
Internet as a whole.
</p>
<p>
Use the site closest to you for the fastest downloads possible whether it is
a primary or secondary site. The program
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/netselect">
<em>netselect</em></a> can be used to
determine the site with the least latency; use a download program such as
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/web/wget">
<em>wget</em></a> or
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/rsync">
<em>rsync</em></a> for determining the site with the most throughput.
Note that geographic proximity often isn't the most important factor for
determining which machine will serve you best.
