<h2>debian-volatile for end users</h2>

<p class="important"><strong>
The debian-volatile project
has been discontinued with the Debian <q>Squeeze</q> release.  See
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile-announce/2012/msg00000.html">\
this announcement</a> for details.
<strong></p>

<h3>What is debian-volatile?</h3>
<p>Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as spam filtering and virus
scanning, and even when using updated data patterns, they do not really
work for the full time of a stable release. The main goal of volatile
is allowing system administrators to update their systems in a nice,
consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of using unstable, even
without getting the drawbacks for the selected packages. So debian-volatile
will only contain changes to stable programs that are necessary to keep them
functional.</p>

<h3>What is debian-volatile/sloppy?</h3>

<p>For packages in the <em>volatile</em> section of the debian-volatile archive,
we try to ensure that newer versions do not introduce functional changes or
require the administrator to modify the configuration file.</p>


<h3>Archive</h3>
<p>The official archive of debian-volatile has been archived on
<a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-volatile/">archive.debian.org</a>.
</p>

<p>The integration into the main archive happened with <q>Squeeze</q>.
Please see the <a
href="$(NEWS)/2011/20110215">\
announcement</a> for details on how to switch to squeeze-updates.
