<h2>debian-volatile for end users</h2>

<h3>What is debian-volatile?</h3>
<p>Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as spam filtering and virus
scanning, and even when using updated data patterns, they do not really
work for the full time of a stable release. The main goal of volatile
is allowing system administrators to update their systems in a nice,
consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of using unstable, even
without getting the drawbacks for the selected packages. So debian-volatile
will only contain changes to stable programs that are necessary to keep them
functional.</p>

<h3>What is debian-volatile/sloppy?</h3>

<p>For packages in the <em>volatile</em> section of the debian-volatile archive,
we try to ensure that newer versions do not introduce functional changes or
require the administrator to modify the configuration file. Software which
cannot be upgraded painlessly will end up in the section
<em>volatile-sloppy</em>.</p>

<h3>Security support for debian-volatile</h3>
<p>The official security team does not support debian-volatile, 
so that <a href="team">the debian-volatile team</a> provides security 
updates regularly.</p>

<h3>Releases of debian-volatile</h3>
<p>debian-volatile has both a staging and a release area. The
staging area is only used by the build daemons. There is no guarantee
that packages in this area are usable for end users. 
Packages in the staging area might not have a safe upgrade path, either.
</p>
<p>Packages are moved to the release area whenever a debian-volatile
update announcement (VUA) is sent to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile-announce">debian-volatile-announce
mailing list</a>. The upgrade path of packages in this area is
guaranteed, as well as the upgrade to the next stable release (<current_testing_name>).</p>

<h3>Archive</h3>
<p>The official archive of debian-volatile is available on the main site
<a href="http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile">volatile.debian.org</a>, but
a <a href="volatile-mirrors">network of mirrors</a> is active and available.
</p>
<p>
Please only use either <current_oldstable_name>/volatile or <current_release_name>/volatile with<br />
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile <current_oldstable_name>/volatile main contrib non-free<br />
or<br />
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile <current_release_name>/volatile main contrib non-free
</p>

<p>
If you want to use the sloppy archive, use the following APT sources:<br />
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile <current_oldstable_name>/volatile-sloppy main contrib non-free<br />
or<br />
deb http://volatile.debian.org/debian-volatile <current_release_name>/volatile-sloppy main contrib non-free
</p>

<p>The integration into the main archive is planned and hopefully available for Squeeze.</p>

<h3>Archive signing key</h3>
<p>The archive key for <current_release_name> can be found in the
debian-archive-keyring package, which is installed by default, or in
<a href="$(HOME)/volatile/<current_release_name>-volatile.asc"><current_release_name>-volatile.asc</a>
on this webserver.</p>

<p>For the <current_oldstable_name> key for , please see
<a href="$(HOME)/volatile/<current_oldstable_name>-volatile.asc"><current_oldstable_name>-volatile.asc</a>.</p>

<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>The generic contact address (for new packages, &hellip;) is the mailing list
<a href="mailto:debian-volatile@lists.debian.org">debian-volatile@lists.debian.org</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to subscribe to that list, please see
