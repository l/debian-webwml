<h2>debian-volatile for end users</h2>

<p><strong>What is debian-volatile?</strong><br />
Some packages aim at fast moving targets, such as spam filtering and virus
scanning, and even when using updated data patterns, they do not really
work for the full time of a stable release. The main goal of volatile
is allowing system administrators to update their systems in a nice,
consistent way, without getting the drawbacks of using unstable, even
without getting the drawbacks for the selected packages.
</p>

<p><strong>Security support for debian-volatile</strong><br />
The official security team does not support debian-volatile, 
so that <a href="team">the debian-volatile team</a> provides regularly security 
updates. Just for notice, at least one member of the <a href="team">debian-volatile team</a> 
is also member of the <a href="http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/">Debian testing
security team</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Releases of debian-volatile</strong><br />
debian-volatile has both a staging and a release area. The
staging area is only used by the build daemons. There is no guarantee
that packages in this area are usable for end users. 
Packages in the staging area could have not a safe upgrade path, too.
</p>
<p>Packages are moved to the release area, whenever a debian-volatile
update announcement (VUA) is send to the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-volatile-announce">debian-volatile
announce mailing list</a>. The upgrade path of packages in this area is
guaranteed, as well as the upgrade to the next stable release (<current_testing_name>).</p>
