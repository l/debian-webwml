#use wml::debian::template title="Network install from floppy disks"

<p>You can boot the Debian installation system from floppy disks, and then
proceed with installing the rest of the Debian from the network.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Download the floppy disk image files from the
      <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-XXXX/</tt> directory of a
      <a href="ftplist">Debian FTP mirror</a>; substitute your computer's
      architecture for the "<tt>XXXX</tt>", for example "i386" or "alpha".
      You can either download just the files you need, as described in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-methods#s-file-descs">\
      installation manual</a>, or simply get the whole tree.
# NB: the location of that section has changed in woody to
# ch-appendix#s-file-descs
  </li>
  <li>Write images to floppy disks, according to the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-methods#s-install-floppies">\
      installation manual</a>.
# NB: the anchor within the file has changed in woody, we'll need to
# change the above to #s-create-floppy
  </li>
  <li>Boot from the rescue floppy, following the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-features-rescue">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>When the installation process prompts you for the files, choose the
      "Network" method in order to connect to a Debian mirror to fetch the
      files from.
# NB: the location of that section has changed in woody to
# ch-install-system#s-install-os-netfetch
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">\
installation manual for your architecture</a> for more information.</p>

# NB: not sure installing the base system over the network is supported in
# potato, the above wording might indicate otherwise!

# NB2: it might be that the installation manuals for other architectures
# explain differences with dealing with diskettes, someone should probably
# investigate if that is so and place additional links
