<p>You can boot the Debian installation system from floppy disks, and then
proceed with installing the rest of Debian from the network.</p>

<if-stable-release release="woody">
# FIXME: These instructions have not yet been updated for the sarge installer.
<ul>
  <li>Download the floppy disk image files from the
      <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-<var>XXXX</var>/</tt> directory of any
      <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">Debian mirror</a>; substitute
      your computer's
      architecture for the "<tt><var>XXXX</var></tt>", for example "i386" or "alpha".
      <br>
      You can either download just the files you need, as described in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-appendix#s-file-descs">\
      installation manual</a>, or simply get the whole tree.
  </li>
  <li>Write images to floppy disks, according to the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-methods#s-create-floppy">\

  </li>
  <li>Boot from the rescue floppy, following the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-from-floppies">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>At the "boot:" prompt, press enter, and follow the installation
      instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-dbootstrap-title">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Configure your network card driver correctly (this is an essential
      prerequisite).
  </li>
  <li>When the installation process prompts you to choose between CD/Hard
      Disk/Network/Floppy media, select "Network".
  </li>
  <li>Connect to a Debian mirror and download the installation files, as
     described in the
