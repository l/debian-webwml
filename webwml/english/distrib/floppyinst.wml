<p>You can boot the Debian installation system from floppy disks, and then
proceed with installing the rest of Debian from the network.</p>

<if-stable-release release="woody">
# FIXME: These instructions have not yet been updated for the sarge installer.
<ul>
  <li>Download the floppy disk image files from the
      <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-<var>XXXX</var>/</tt> directory of any
      <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">Debian mirror</a>; substitute
      your computer's
      architecture for the "<tt><var>XXXX</var></tt>", for example "i386" or "alpha".
      <br />
      You can either download just the files you need, as described in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-appendix#s-file-descs">\
      installation manual</a>, or simply get the whole tree.
  </li>
  <li>Write images to floppy disks, according to the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-methods#s-create-floppy">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Boot from the rescue floppy, following the instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-boot-from-floppies">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>At the "boot:" prompt, press enter, and follow the installation
      instructions in the
      <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-rescue-boot#s-dbootstrap-title">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Configure your network card driver correctly (this is an essential
      prerequisite).
  </li>
  <li>When the installation process prompts you to choose between CD/Hard
      Disk/Network/Floppy media, select "Network".
  </li>
  <li>Connect to a Debian mirror and download the installation files, as
     described in the 
     <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-system#s-install-os-netfetch">\
      installation manual</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Not all architectures support installing from floppy disk. If it is
supported, you will need to download the floppy images from one of our
mirrors and write the images to floppy disks. If you have an installation
CD-ROM or DVD the floppy images may also be included on the CD/DVD.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">\
installation manual for your architecture</a>, especially the chapter
<q>Obtaining System Installation Media</q>, for more information.</p>

# NB: it might be that the installation manuals for other architectures
# explain differences with dealing with diskettes, someone should probably
# investigate if that is so and place additional links
