<p>You can boot the Debian installation system from floppy disks, and then
proceed with installing the rest of Debian from the network.</p>

<p>Not all architectures support installing from floppy disk. If it is
supported, you can <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/debian-installer">download
the floppy images</a>, and write the images to floppy disks. If you have an
installation CD-ROM or DVD the floppy images may also be included on the
CD/DVD.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">\
installation manual for your architecture</a>, especially the chapter
<q>Obtaining System Installation Media</q>, for more information.</p>

# NB: it might be that the installation manuals for other architectures
# explain differences with dealing with diskettes, someone should probably
# investigate if that is so and place additional links
