#use wml::debian::template title="Network install from floppy disks"

<p>Download the <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-XXXX/</tt> directory from a
<a href="ftplist">Debian FTP mirror</a>; substitute your architecture for
the "<tt>XXXX</tt>", for example "i386" or "alpha". This one directory is
all you need to get Debian up and running. After this, your new Debian
system can connect directly to a Debian FTP mirror to automatically fetch
and install anything else you need.</p>

<p>Refer to the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/i386/ch-install-methods#s-install-floppies">\
installation manual</a> for further information.</p>

# NB: the anchor within the file has changed in woody, we'll probably need
# to change it to #s-create-floppy or something similar.

# NB2: it might be that the installation manuals for other architectures
# explain differences with dealing with diskettes, someone should probably
# investigate if that is so and place additional links
