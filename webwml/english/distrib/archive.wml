<p>If you need to access one of the old distributions of Debian, you can
find them at the <a href="https://archive.debian.org/debian/">Debian
Archives</a>, <tt>https://archive.debian.org/debian/</tt>.</p>

<p>You can search packages in the old distributions at <url https://archive.debian.net>.</p>

<p>Releases are stored by their codenames under the dists/ directory.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../releases/squeeze/">squeeze</a> is Debian 6.0</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/lenny/">lenny</a> is Debian 5.0</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/etch/">etch</a> is Debian 4.0</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/sarge/">sarge</a> is Debian 3.1</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/woody/">woody</a> is Debian 3.0</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/potato/">potato</a> is Debian 2.2</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/slink/">slink</a> is Debian 2.1</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/hamm/">hamm</a> is Debian 2.0</li>
  <li>bo   is Debian 1.3</li>
  <li>rex  is Debian 1.2</li>
  <li>buzz is Debian 1.1</li>
</ul>

<p>As time goes on we will expire the binary packages for old releases.
Currently we have binaries for
<i>squeeze</i>,
<i>lenny</i>,
<i>etch</i>, <i>sarge</i>, <i>woody</i>, <i>potato</i>, <i>slink</i>, <i>hamm</i>
and <i>bo</i> available, and only source code for the other releases.</p>

<p>If you are using APT the relevant sources.list entries are like:</p>
<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ hamm contrib main non-free
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian/ bo bo-unstable contrib main non-free
</pre>

<p>The following is a list of mirrors that include the archive:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="non-us-archive">debian-non-US archive</toc-add-entry>

<p>In the past, there was software packaged for Debian that could not be
distributed in the US (and other countries) due to restrictions on export
of cryptography or software patents. Debian maintained a special archive
called the <q>non-US</q> archive.</p>

<p>These packages were incorporated into the main archive in Debian 3.1
and the debian-non-US archive is discontinued; it is actually
<em>archived</em> now, incorporated into the archive.debian.org archives.</p>

<p>They are still available from the archive.debian.org machine.
Available access methods are:</p>
<blockquote><p>
<a href="https://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/">https://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/</a><br>
rsync://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/  (limited)
</p></blockquote>

<p>To use these packages with APT, the relevant sources.list entries are like:</p>

<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/ woody/non-US main contrib non-free
  deb-src http://archive.debian.org/debian-non-US/ woody/non-US main contrib non-free
</pre>
