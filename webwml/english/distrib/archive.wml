#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution Archives"

<p>If you need to access one of the old distributions of Debian, you can
find them at the <a href="http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/">Debian
Archives</a>, <tt>http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/</tt>.</p>

<p>Releases are stored by their codenames under the dists/ directory.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="../releases/woody/">woody</a> is Debian 3.0</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/potato/">potato</a> is Debian 2.2</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/slink/">slink</a> is Debian 2.1</li>
  <li><a href="../releases/hamm/">hamm</a> is Debian 2.0</li>
  <li>bo   is Debian 1.3</li>
  <li>rex  is Debian 1.2</li>
  <li>buzz is Debian 1.1</li>
</ul>

<p>As time goes on we will expire the binary packages for old releases.
Currently we have binaries for <i>woody</i>, <i>potato</i>, <i>slink</i>, <i>hamm</i>
and <i>bo</i> available, and only source code for the other releases.</p>

<p>If you are using APT the relevant sources.list entries are like:</p>
<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/ hamm contrib main non-free
</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>
  deb http://archive.debian.org/debian-archive/ bo bo-unstable contrib main non-free
</pre>

<p>The following is a list of mirrors that include the archive:</p>

<h2>Non-US archive</h2>

<p>In the past, there was software packaged for Debian that could not be
distributed in the US (and other countries) due to restrictions on export
of cryptography or software patents. Debian maintained a special archive
called the <q>non-US</q> archive.</p>

<p>These packages were incorporated into the main archive in Debian 3.1
and the debian-non-US archive is discontinued; it is actually an
<em>archive</em> now, complementing the archive.debian.org archives.</p>

<p>Mirrors carried non-US, the <tt>debian-non-US</tt> directory.
The <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list-non-US">list of Debian-non-US mirrors</a>
has included those sites.</p>
