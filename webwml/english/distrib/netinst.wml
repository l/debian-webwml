<p><strong>Should I install Debian via the network instead of from a
CD-ROM?</strong></p>

<p>It depends. In many cases a network install is preferable to
downloading CD images, because:</p>

<ul>

  <li>During installation, the computer will only download those .deb
  packages that you actually want, and not waste time (and bandwidth)
  on all the others.</li>

  <li>The "testing" distribution moves too fast (new packages are added
  daily) - any CD images of "testing" that you download are outdated very
  quickly.</li>

  <li>All the professional Debian users do it this way! ;-) (Or at least
  those with free internet access.)</li>

</ul>

<p>On the other hand, sometimes CDs are better because you can use them for
rescue-booting a damaged system (but you can make a rescue floppy during
installation...), for installing Debian on more than one machine, or on
machines without an internet connection.</p>

<p>The network install assumes that either an analogue PPP dialup connection
to your Internet provider, or Internet access via Ethernet (possibly using a
PCMCIA card in your laptop) is available. Unfortunately, it does not support
<strong>internal</strong> ISDN cards.</p>

<p>There are two options for net installs:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="../CD/images/netinst/">Minimal CD</a>:
  Instead of getting a full 650MB CD image, you just download a CD image
  which contains the bare essentials necessary to install the rest.</li>

  <li><a href="floppyinst">Floppy discs</a>:
  You first download "floppy disc images" and write them to a couple of
  floppy discs, then start the installation by booting from floppy.</li>

</ul>

<p>Be sure to have a look at the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">detailed
information about the installation process</a>.</p>
