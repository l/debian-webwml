#use wml::debian::template title="Installing Debian GNU/Linux via the Internet" BARETITLE=true

<p>If you have a permanent connection to the Internet, you can install
Debian using that. You would initially download only a small portion of
Debian required to start the installation process, and then install
whatever else you want from within the installation program.</p>

<p>The network install assumes that either an analogue PPP dialup connection
to your Internet provider, or Internet access via Ethernet (possibly using a
PCMCIA card in your laptop) is available. Unfortunately, it does not support
<strong>internal</strong> ISDN cards.</p>

<p>There are two options for installs over the network:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../CD/images/netinst/">Minimal CD</a>:
  Instead of getting a full 650MB CD image, you just download a CD image
  file which contains the bare essentials necessary to install the rest.
  </li>
  <li><a href="floppyinst">Floppy disks</a>:
  You download a couple of floppy disk images (files the size of a floppy
  disk), write them to floppy disks, and then start the installation by
  booting from the those diskettes.</li>
</ul>
