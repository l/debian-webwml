<p>If you have a permanent connection to the Internet, you can install
Debian using that. You would initially download only a small portion of
Debian required to start the installation process, and then install
whatever else you want from within the installation program.</p>

<p>This sort of network installation process requires Internet access 
via Ethernet or wireless (possibly using a PCMCIA card in your laptop).
Unfortunately, it does not support <strong>internal</strong> ISDN cards.</p>

<p>There are three options for installs over the network:</p>

<toc-display />

<toc-add-entry name="smallcd">Small CDs</toc-add-entry>

<p>Instead of getting a full 650MB CD image, you just download a CD image
file which contains the bare essentials necessary to install the rest.
It is necessary to have access to a CD recorder in order to use this.</p>

<p>The following are image files which are up to 180&nbsp;MB in size,
making them suitable for writing to small CD-R(W) media, 80&nbsp;mm/3.1"
in diameter:</p>

<ul><li><stable-netinst-images /></li></ul>

<p>The following are image files which are up to 40&nbsp;MB in size,
making them suitable for writing to business card-shaped CDs (available
in differing sizes, e.g. 58&times;75&nbsp;mm/2.3&times;3" in diameter):</p>

<ul><li><stable-businesscard-images /></li></ul>

<p>For details, please see: <a href="../CD/netinst/">Network install
from a minimal CD</a></p>

<toc-add-entry name="verysmall">Tiny CDs, floppy disks, USB sticks, etc</toc-add-entry>

<p>You can download a couple of image files the size of a floppy disk
or another removable media of similar small size, write them to the media,
and then start the installation by booting from that.</p>

<p>There is some diversity in the support for installing from various
very small images between the architectures. Here are the links to
the available image files (look at the MANIFEST file for information):</p>

<ul><li><stable-verysmall-images /></li></ul>

<p>For details, please refer to the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">installation manual for
your architecture</a>, especially the chapter
<q>Obtaining System Installation Media</q>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="netboot">Network boot</toc-add-entry>

<p>You set up a TFTP and a DHCP (or BOOTP, or RARP) server which will
serve the installation media to machines on your local network.
If your client machine's BIOS supports it, you can then boot the Debian
installation system from the network (using PXE and TFTP), and proceed
with installing the rest of Debian from the network.</p>

<p>Not all machines support booting from the network. Because of the
additional work required, this method for installing Debian is not
recommended for novice users.</p>

<p>Here are the links to the image files (look at the MANIFEST file for
information):</p>
