<p>This method of installing Debian requires a functioning Internet connection
<em>during</em> installation. Compared to other methods you end up downloading
less data as the process will be tailored to your requirements. Ethernet and
wireless connections are supported. Internal ISDN cards are unfortunately
<em>not</em> supported.</p>
<p>There are three options for installs over the network:</p>

<p>For details, please see: <a href="../CD/netinst/">Network install
from a minimal CD</a></p>

<div class="line">
<div class="item col50">

<toc-add-entry name="verysmall">Tiny CDs, flexible USB sticks, etc.</toc-add-entry>

<p>You can download a couple of image files of small size, suitable for
USB Sticks and similar devices, write them to the media,
and then start the installation by booting from that.</p>

<p>There is some diversity in the support for installing from various
very small images between the architectures.

<p>For details, please refer to the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">installation manual for
your architecture</a>, especially the chapter
<q>Obtaining System Installation Media</q>.</p>

Here are the links to
the available image files (look at the MANIFEST file for information):

<toc-add-entry name="netboot">Network boot</toc-add-entry>

<p>You set up a TFTP and a DHCP (or BOOTP, or RARP) server which will
serve the installation media to machines on your local network.
If your client machine's BIOS supports it, you can then boot the Debian
installation system from the network (using PXE and TFTP), and proceed
with installing the rest of Debian from the network.</p>

<p>Not all machines support booting from the network. Because of the
additional work required, this method for installing Debian is not
recommended for novice users.</p>
