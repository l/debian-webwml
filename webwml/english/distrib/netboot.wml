<p>If your BIOS supports it, you can boot the Debian installation system from
the network (using PXE and TFTP), and proceed with installing the rest of
Debian from the internet.</p>

<p>Not all machines support booting from the network. If it is
supported by the BIOS, you will need to setup a TFTP server on your local
netowrk, as well as change the configuration of your DHCP server.  For this
reason, this method for installing Debian is not recommended for novice users.</p>

<p>Please refer to the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">\
installation manual for your architecture</a>, especially the chapter
<q>Preparing Files for TFTP Net Booting</q>, for more information.</p>
