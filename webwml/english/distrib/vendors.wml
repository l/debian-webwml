<H1>CD Manufacturers</H1>

<P>Debian provides Official CD &ldquo;Masters&rdquo; to all CD manufacturers
on request.  Anyone can duplicate and sell the Official CD without having to
pay us any fee.  CD manufacturers may also make non-official Debian CDs,
which may contain files added by the CD manufacturer as well as those
provided by Debian. ISO image files for the Debian 1.3.1 Official 2-CD Set
are now available at
<A href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/OfficialCD/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/OfficialCD/</A>
or one of the <A href="$(MISC)/CD.mirrors.txt">official CD mirrors</A>.
If you are interested in creating CDs containing Debian, make sure you read
the <A href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/README.CD-manufacture">note to CD
manufacturers</A>.

<H2>From contributing CD manufacturers</H2>

<P>The companies listed in this section contribute a portion of the proceeds
from the sale of CDs to SPI, the non-profit corporation that oversees Debian.
See our <A href="$(HOME)/donations">donation page</A> for details.

  Dale Scheetz is an active Debian developer. Dale maintains 12 Debian
  packages, and puts a lot of time into supporting users on the
  debian-user mailing list and refining the system design with our
  developers.

  <P><SMALL>
  His latest accomplishment has been &ldquo;Drop in Debian&rdquo; (DiD),
  a small Debian installation suitable for building a custom kernel.
  It installs on a DOS machine as a set of 5 files, one of which is a batch
  program that starts up a kernel and gets the system running straight from
  the DOS prompt.
  </SMALL>
  <P><SMALL> 
  This product is being distributed by Flexible Software on a Gold
  CD that contains the complete 1.3 binary distribution for Intel machines,
  but with a couple of patches to the kernel, the installation software can
  be used to build your own DiD on any DOS machine.
