<h3>About Debian CDs</h3>

<p>Debian creates and provides its entire distribution free of charge.
	Debian does not manufacture its own CDs, but relies on 3rd party
	vendors.
	To make it easier for CD vendors to provide a high quality disk
	we provide <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">Official CD</a> images
	for them. This is the only version that has been fully tested by our testing
	team and is by far the most popular way to buy Debian.

<p>The type of CD is indicated under each entry.
	<UL>
	<LI>`Official CD' indicates that the vendor sells the Official
		 Debian CD set as distributed by us.
	<LI>`Development Snapshot' indicates the vendor sells a snapshot of the unstable
		 version of Debian. These are generally smaller runs and cost more money.
		 The frequency of the snapshots is also given. These are mostly used by
		 developers and others who like to live on the edge.
	<LI>`Vendor Release' means the CD set is one created by the vendor based on the 
		 Debian distribution. These usually include software that are not on the
		 Official CD. See the vendors web site for details.
	<LI>`Custom Release' means the vendor will create a CD set to your specifications.
	<LI>`Multiple Distribution' means that Debian is only sold as part of a
		 set of CDs including multiple distributions of Linux.
	<LI>'non-US' indicates that at least part of the collection of software
		 that is not in the main Debian distribution due to United States export
		 regulations or copyright restrictions is included.
	<LI>'non-free' indicates that at least part of the collection of software deemed
		 non-free by the <a href="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
		 Guidelines</a> but stored in the Debian archive is included. It is up to the
		 vendor to negotiate the terms of distribution with the author of the software.
	</UL>
<P>Entries separated by a semi-colon, ';', are separate products.

<P>Some vendors allow customers to pay extra money and donate this to
	Debian. Others contribute a portion of sales of Debian CDs back to
	Debian. This is denoted under the entry 'Allows Contribution to
	Debian.'  We hope that you will consider making a donation to Debian.

<P>It is usually cheaper to find a vendor in your own country since shipping
	costs will be less. There are some vendors who find they can provide
	CDs for less money by buying CDs in bulk from a large vendor in
	another country and reselling them. Since some people find this
	confusing, resellers are clearly marked.  Note that this should have
	no effect on the quality of the disks.

<h3>Information for Vendors</h3>
<P>If you are considering selling Debian CDs, you should look at the Debian
<a href="cdinfo">vendor information</a> page.

If you would like to be added to this page, send email to 
<A href="mailto:webmaster@debian.org">webmaster@debian.org</A>. With the
following details:
<UL>
<LI>Vendor Name
<LI>URL of Vendor
<LI>Wether or not you donate some of the sale to Debian
<LI>Type of CDs sold (see at the top of page for details
<LI>Country you are in
<LI>Do you ship orders overseas (yes,no,some areas or within Europe)
<LI>URL of a web page that has information about your Debian CDs
<LI>Email address for sales enquiries
</UL>
<P>
It's important that you keep this information up to date as we try to check
it every now and then and if, for example, the web page has gone or mail
bounces we delete your entry.
<P>
You must have some webpage somewhere (specified in the Debian URL line) that
mentions what sort of Debian CDs you sell.  We are thinking of making this
a mandatory field in the near future.
<hr>
<P>Debian CDs are quite inexpensive, but you may be able to find an even better deal
if you don't mind getting a used, slightly dated, CD.
