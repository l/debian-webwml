#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<H2>Intro</H2>

<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian: you can download the distribution
off the net (using FTP) or you can buy a set of CDs.

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<H2>Manpower</H2>

<P>The release cycles are guided by the hand of Richard Braakman.  The main
FTP archives are managed by Guy Maor, James Troup and Richard Braakman.

<H2>Boot Floppies</H2>

<P>A very important part of any distribution is the boot floppies.  Without
these, getting an initial install is nigh impossible. The e-mail address for
contacting the install system team is debian-boot@lists.debian.org. The
current team is coordinated by Adam Di Carlo, and members are:
