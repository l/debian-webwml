#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<H2>Intro</H2>
<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian: you can download the distribution
off the net (using FTP) or you can buy a set of CDs.

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<H2>Manpower</H2>
<P>The release cycles are guided by the hand of Richerd Braakman.  The main
FTP archives are managed by Guy Maor, James Troup and Richard Braakman.

<H2>Boot Floppies</H2>
<P>A very important part of any distribution is the boot floppies.  Without
these, getting an initial install is nigh impossible.  Nobody is working on
boot disk for mips and arm architectures.  The current team members are:
<UL>
	<LI>Enrique Zanardi - coordinator, i386
	<LI>Loic Prylli - Alpha
	<LI>Michael Schmitz - m68k
	<LI>Hartmut Koptein - PowerPC
	<LI>Eric Delaunay - Sparc/Sparc64
</UL>

<H2>Quality Assurance</H2>

<H3>What is debian-qa and is it eatable?</H3>
  
<P>QA stands for Quality Assurance and is intended to keep the quality
  of the distribution as high as it should be.  At the moment there is
  no real Quality Assurance for Debian.  This is mainly due to people
  who had initiated QA found themselves burried in other important
  (Debian-related) stuff.
  
<H3>Do we need Quality Assurance?</H3>

<P>With the growing number of developers working on Debian (500+
  registrated developers at the moment) QA is urgently needed.  It is
  very interesting (and usually not the case) that the quality of
  Debian is still that high.  With companies having more than 500
  concurrent developers ... I don't want to think about this...
  
<P>Although we have strict rules (Policy) that defines requirements for
  packages there is still missing a "department" which assures that
  every package is packaged well and integrates in the system nicely.

<P>To be honest, there are still *lots* of packages not using all the
  suggested tools and integration (menu files, dwww files, doc-base
  files, alternatives, proper suggests/recommends, proper priorities
  etc.)

<H3>Helping with Quality Assurance</H3>
<P>Now that several new maintainers mentioned QA or QA-like work in their
new-maintainers application I'd like to invite people to work on QA
for Debian.  This doesn't need a fully fledged developer but also
people who can only spend a few hours on Debian.

<P>I would appreciate if some people, both new and regular developers,
would decide to work on QA for Debian GNU.  Please look at the
following - incomplete - list of things which fall into the field of
duty for the QA team:

<UL>
 <LI>Check old bugs - and work on them
 <LI>Check packages with lots of bugs - and work on them
 <LI>Check if all packages providing user programs (X11 or not) come
   with menu files

 <LI>Such packages have to call update-menus in their postinst and
     prerm scripts

 <LI>Check if all packages that provide documentation register it for
     dwww, doc-base or whatever

 <LI>Check if packages are policy conforming

 <LI>Add documentation where it is needed - there are lots of places
     where documentation is missing.

 <LI>Detect orphaned packages and take care of them

 <LI>Check if packages still work - especially old ones

 <LI>Check if priorities, recommends, suggests and depends are used
     properly

 <LI>Check if packages are linked against proper libraries, maybe check
     if they would work with newer stable ones (especially for Gtk-based
     programs) as well

 <LI>Watch out for new versions of software and notify maintainers if
     needed.
</UL>

<P>If you find packages which lack support for some of the features
mentioned above the proper action would be to file a wishlist bug
report.  The bug report has to point to accurate documentation or
better include a description of the missing feature and a description
how to solve this.  It would be best if the report would include a
proper patch/menu file/doc file etc.
