<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.
The <a href="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</a>
contains detailed installation instructions.
</p>

<p>If you simply want to install Debian, these are your options:</p>

<div class="line">
  <div class="item col50">
    <h2><a href="netinst">Download a small installation image</a></h2>
   <p><strong>
      Use Internet to download additional files during installation.
   </strong></p>
   <p>
      These small <q>netinst</q> images can be downloaded quickly
      and should be recorded onto a CD/DVD/USB disk.
         These allow you to download only those Debian packages that
         you actually want, but require an Internet connection on the
         machine you are installing Debian onto.
   </p>

     <h2><a href="../CD/">Download large installation images</a></h2>
   <p><strong>
      Useful when the install target has no Internet connection.
   </strong></p>
   <p>
      The CD/DVD images can be downloaded using
      <a href="../CD/http-ftp/">HTTP/FTP</a>,
      <a href="../CD/torrent-cd/">BitTorrent</a>, or
      <a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">Jigdo</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The large CD and DVD images contain more packages, making it
      easier to install machines without an Internet connection.
      However, if you get a whole set of CDs or DVDs, you will get a lot of
      packages that you won't actually use.

    <h2><a href="../CD/vendors/">Buy a set of CDs or DVDs from one of the
      vendors selling Debian CDs</a></h2>

   <p>
      Many of the vendors sell the distribution for less than US$5 plus
      shipping (check their web page to see if they ship internationally).
      <br />
      Some of the <a href="../doc/books">books about Debian</a> come with
      CDs, too.
   </p>

   <p>Here are the basic advantages of CDs prepared by someone else:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>Installation from a CD set is more straightforward.</li>
     <li>You can install on machines without an Internet connection.</li>
	 <li>You can install Debian (on as many machines as you like) without downloading
	 all packages yourself.</li>
     <li>The CD can be used to more easily rescue a damaged Debian system.</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="item col50 lastcol">
    <h2><a href="pre-installed">Buy a computer with Debian
      pre-installed</a></h2>
   <p>There are a number of advantages to this:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>You don't have to install Debian.</li>
    <li>The installation is pre-configured to match the hardware.</li>
    <li>The vendor may provide technical support.</li>
   </ul>
    <h2><a href="../CD/live/">Try Debian live before installing</a></h2>
   <p>
      You can now try Debian by booting a live system from a CD, DVD or
      USB key without installing any files to the computer. When you are
      ready, you can run the included installer.
      Read <a href="../CD/live#choose_live">information about this method</a>
      to see if it is suitable for you.
