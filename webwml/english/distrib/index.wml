#use wml::debian::template title="Getting Debian"

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over the Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If you simply want to install Debian, these are your options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Buy a set of CDs from <a href="../CD/vendors/">one of the
      vendors selling Debian CDs</a> and install from it.</strong>

   <p>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set.
      <br>
      Many of the vendors sell the distribution for less than US$5 plus
      shipping (check their web page to see if they ship internationally).
      <br>
      Some of the <A HREF="../doc/books">books about Debian</A> come with
      CDs, too.
   </p>

   <p>Here are the basic advantages of CDs prepared by someone else:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>Installation from a CD set is more straightforward.</li>
     <li>You can install on machines without an Internet connection.</li>
     <li>You can install Debian on more than one machine.</li>
     <li>The CD can be used to more easily rescue a damaged Debian system.</li>
   </ul>

   <br>&nbsp;
  </li>

  <li><strong>Download <a href="../CD/">images of Debian CD/DVDs</a> over
      the Internet, make a CD set yourself and install from that.
      </strong>

   <p>If you prepare the CDs yourself, you get all the advantages of CDs
   mentioned above, and:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>You can use your own CD recorder, and rewritable media (CD-RW).</li>
     <li>You can use your Internet connection.</li>
     <li>You don't have to wait for the shipping.</li>
   </ul>

   <br>&nbsp;
  </li>

  <li><strong>Download the installation system from the Internet,
      and get the rest by <a href="netinst">downloading as you
      install</a>.</strong>

   <p>The network installation also has its pros:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>You can use your Internet connection, and rewritable media
         (diskettes or CD-RWs).</li>
     <li>You will only download those .deb packages that you actually want.
         <br>
         If you get a whole CD set, you will get a lot of packages that
         you won't actually use.</li>
     <li>A network installation of the <a href="../releases/testing/">"testing"</a>
         distribution will provide you with the very latest packages, whereas
         any CD images of "testing" that you download would be outdated very
         quickly.</li>
   </ul>

   <br>&nbsp;
  </li>

  <li><strong>Buy a <a href="pre-installed">computer with Debian
      pre-installed</a>.</strong>

   <p>There are a number of advantages to this:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>You don't have to install Debian.</li>
    <li>The installation is pre-configured to match the hardware.</li>
    <li>The vendor may provide technical support.</li>
   </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</a> for
your target architecture contains instructions
and links for all the files you need to install.</p>
