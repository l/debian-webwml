#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian: you can download the distribution
off the net (using FTP) or you can buy a set of CDs.

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).
