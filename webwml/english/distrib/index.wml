#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<H2>Intro</H2>

<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian:
<UL>
  <LI>download the distribution <A HREF="ftplist">off the net</A>
      (using HTTP, FTP or rsync) from one of our mirrors
  <LI>buy <A HREF="vendors">a set of CDs</A> from one of the vendors selling
      Debian CDs.
</UL>

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<P>Before trying to install or upgrade Debian, please read the 
<A HREF="../releases/stable/#release-notes">Release Notes</A> and the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/#new-inst">Installation Manual</A> for the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/">current stable release</A>.
The Installation Manual for your target architecture contains instructions
and links for all the files you need to install.

<H2>Manpower</H2>

<P>The release cycles are guided by the hand of Anthony Towns.
The main FTP archives are managed by James Troup, Michael Beattie,
Anthony Towns and Ryan Murray.

<P>Each package has its own maintainer, full list of which you can find
<A HREF="../devel/people">here</A>.

<H2>Install System Team</H2>

<P>A very important part of any distribution are the boot floppies, because
without these, getting an initial install is nigh impossible. The e-mail
address for contacting the Debian install system team is
debian-boot@lists.debian.org.

<P>The current team is coordinated by Adam Di Carlo, and members are:
<UL>
	<LI>i386: Enrique Zanardi, Marcel Harkema, Karl M. Hegbloom
	<LI>m68k: Michael Schmitz, Christian T. Steiges, Nick Holgate
	<LI>alpha: Loic Prylli, David Huggins-Daines, Andrew D Lenharth
	<LI>sparc: Eric Delaunay, Ben Collins
	<LI>powerpc: Hartmut Koptein, Matt Porter, Daniel Jacobowitz
	<LI>arm: Jim Pick, Jim Studt
	<LI>various other things: Martin Bialasinski, Randolph Chung,
            Erik Andersen, Joey Hess, Stefan Gybas
</UL>

<H2>Quality Assurance</H2>

<P>The goal of our Quality Assurance ("QA") is to improve Debian wherever
it can be improved, and to keep the quality of the distribution as
high as it should be.

<P>Currently, the Quality Assurance group is still in the process of
creation, although the idea exists for quite some time. Visit the
<A HREF="http://qa.debian.org/">Quality Assurance</A> web pages to find
out more information about the effort.

<H2>Helpful resources</H2>

<P>People often wonder what exact software does Debian GNU/Linux include, so
we have provided a <A HREF="packages">list of all packages</A> in Debian,
which includes links to pages with more detailed information about each
package, and search engines for packages and their contents.

<P>We have compiled a list of <A HREF="books">books about Debian</A>, some
of which come with CDs.
