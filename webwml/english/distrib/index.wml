#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over the Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If you simply want to install Debian, you have these options:</p>

<UL>
  <li>install by <a href="netinst">downloading necessary packages over
      the Internet</a>
  <li>buy <a href="../CD/vendors/">a set of CDs</A> from one of the vendors
      selling Debian CDs, and install from it.
      Some of the <A HREF="../doc/books">books about Debian</A> come with
      CDs, too.
</UL>

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<P>Before trying to install or upgrade Debian, please read the 
<A HREF="../releases/stable/releasenotes">Release Notes</A> and the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</A> for the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/">current stable release</A>.
The Installation Manual for your target architecture contains instructions
and links for all the files you need to install.

<P>People often wonder what exact software does Debian GNU/Linux include, so
we have provided a <A HREF="packages">list of all packages</A> in Debian,
which includes links to pages with more detailed information about each
package, and search engines for packages and their contents.
