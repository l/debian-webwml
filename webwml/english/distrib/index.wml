#use wml::debian::template title="Getting Debian"

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over the Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If you simply want to install Debian, these are your options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="netinst">Download a small image file, record it to
      a CD/DVD/USB disk/floppy, and install using the Internet.</a></strong>
   <p>
      These small <q>netinst</q> images can be downloaded quickly.
         These allow you to download only those Debian packages that
         you actually want, but require an Internet connection on the
         machine being installed.
   </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Download larger CD/DVD image files, record and install using
      that media only.</strong>
   <p>
      The CD/DVD images can be downloaded using
      <strong><a href="../CD/http-ftp/">HTTP/FTP</a></strong>,
      <strong><a href="../CD/torrent-cd/">BitTorrent</a></strong>, or
      <strong><a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">Jigdo</a></strong>.
   </p>
   <p>
      The large CD and DVD images contain more packages, making it
      easier to install machines without an Internet connection.
      However, if you get a whole set of CDs or DVDs, you will get a lot of
      packages that you won't actually use.
   </p>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Buy a set of CDs or DVDs from <a href="../CD/vendors/">one of the
      vendors selling Debian CDs</a> and install from it.</strong>

   <p>
      Many of the vendors sell the distribution for less than US$5 plus
      shipping (check their web page to see if they ship internationally).
      <br />
      Some of the <a href="../doc/books">books about Debian</a> come with
      CDs, too.
   </p>

   <p>Here are the basic advantages of CDs prepared by someone else:</p>

   <ul>
     <li>Installation from a CD set is more straightforward.</li>
     <li>You can install on machines without an Internet connection.</li>
	 <li>You can install Debian (on as many machines as you like) without downloading
	 all packages yourself.</li>
     <li>The CD can be used to more easily rescue a damaged Debian system.</li>
   </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Buy a <a href="pre-installed">computer with Debian
      pre-installed</a>.</strong>

   <p>There are a number of advantages to this:</p>

   <ul>
    <li>You don't have to install Debian.</li>
    <li>The installation is pre-configured to match the hardware.</li>
    <li>The vendor may provide technical support.</li>
   </ul>

  </li>

</ul>

<p>The <a href="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</a>
contains detailed installation instructions.</p>
