#use wml::debian::template title="Getting Debian"

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over the Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If you simply want to install Debian, you have these options:</p>

<UL>
  <li>buy <a href="../CD/vendors/">a set of CDs</A> from one of the vendors
      selling Debian CDs, and install from it.
  <li>install by <a href="netinst">downloading over the Internet</a>.
</UL>

<p>The <a href="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</a> for
your target architecture contains instructions
and links for all the files you need to install.</p>

<p><strong><em>Should I install Debian from a CD or via the network?</em></strong></p>

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set.
<br>
Many of the vendors sell the distribution for less than US$5 plus
shipping (check their web page to see if they ship internationally).
<br>
Some of the <A HREF="../doc/books">books about Debian</A> come with CDs, too.
</p>

<p>Here are the basic advantages of the CDs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Installation from a CD set is more straightforward.</p>
  <li>You can install on machines without an Internet connection.</p>
  <li>You can install Debian on more than one machine.</li>
  <li>The CD can be used to more easily rescue a damaged Debian system.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, a network install also has its pros:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You don't have to pay for the CDs.</li>
  <li>You will only download those .deb packages that you actually want.
      <br>
      If you buy a CD set or download the full CD images, you will
      waste money or time and bandwidth on a lot of packages that you
      won't actually use.</li>
  <li>A network installation of the <a href="../releases/testing/">"testing"</a>
      distribution will provide you with the very latest packages, whereas
      any CD images of "testing" that you download would be outdated very
      quickly.</li>
</ul>

<p>People often wonder exactly what software is included in Debian GNU/Linux, so
we have provided a <A HREF="packages">list of all packages</A> in Debian,
which includes links to pages with more detailed information about each
package, and search engines for packages and their contents.
