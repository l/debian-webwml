#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian: you can download the distribution
off the net (using FTP) or you can buy a set of CDs.

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<P>The installation instructions for Debian can be found at
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/install.html">
ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/install.html</a>.
<BR><STRONG>The list of files you need for installation using the net can
be found in the installation instructions</STRONG>.
