#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to obtain a copy
of Debian GNU/Linux.
There are two methods of getting Debian:
<UL>
  <LI>download the distribution <A HREF="ftplist">off the net</A>
      (using HTTP, FTP or rsync) from one of our mirrors
  <LI>buy <A HREF="vendors">a set of CDs</A> from one of the vendors selling
      Debian CDs. Some of the <A HREF="../doc/books">books about Debian</A>
      come with CDs, too.
</UL>

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<P>Before trying to install or upgrade Debian, please read the 
<A HREF="../releases/stable/#release-notes">Release Notes</A> and the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/#new-inst">Installation Manual</A> for the
<A HREF="../releases/stable/">current stable release</A>.
The Installation Manual for your target architecture contains instructions
and links for all the files you need to install.

<P>People often wonder what exact software does Debian GNU/Linux include, so
we have provided a <A HREF="packages">list of all packages</A> in Debian,
which includes links to pages with more detailed information about each
package, and search engines for packages and their contents.
