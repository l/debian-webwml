#use wml::debian::template title="Distribution"

<H2>Intro</H2>
<P>You probably entered this page because you would like to install Debian.
There are two methods of getting Debian: you can download the distribution
off the net (using FTP) or you can buy a set of CDs.

<P>It is recommended that first time installers buy the CD set as the
installation is more straightforward. Many of the vendors sell the
distribution for less than US$5 plus shipping (check their web page to
see if they ship internationally).

<H2>Manpower</H2>
<P>The release cyclea are guided by the hand of Richerd Braakman.  The main
FTP archives are managed by Guy Maor, James Troup and Richard Braakman.

<H2>Boot Floppies</H2>
<P>A very important part of any distribution is the boot floppies.  Without
these, getting an initial install is nigh impossible.  Nobody is working on
boot disk for mips and arm architectures.  The current team members are:
<UL>
	<LI>Enrique Zanardi - coordinator, i386
	<LI>Loic Prylli - Alpha
	<LI>Michael Schmitz - m68k
	<LI>Hartmut Koptein - PowerPC
	<LI>Eric Delaunay - Sparc/Sparc64
</UL>

<H2>Quality Assurance</H2>
<P>Quality Assurance is a team effort.  These people care for orphaned and
neglected packages.  They work to stamp out bugs that would hold up a
release or seem to be ignored by the package maintainer.  The members of
that team are:
<UL>
	<LI>Vincent Renardias
	<LI>James Troup
	<LI>Martin 'Joey' Schulze
	<LI>Christian Kurz
	<LI>Anthony Towns
	<LI>Torsten Landschoff
	<LI>Joey Hess
	<LI>Ray Dassen
	<LI>Josip Rodin
	<LI>Jeff Licquia, <I>future</I>
	<LI>Hamish Moffatt
	<LI>Mika Fischer, <I>future</I>
