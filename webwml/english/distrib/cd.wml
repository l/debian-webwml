  <title>Installing Debian GNU/Linux via CD images</title>
</head>
<body>
</html>

#<p>If you have access to a permanent connection to the Internet, you can
#download CD image files there, create CDs using those images and install
#Debian from those CDs.</p>
#
#<p>There are three options for getting the CD images:</p>
#
#<ul>
#  <li><a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">Assemble images using jigdo</a>:
#      Instead of getting a lot of large image files, you use a special
#      application called "jigdo", which works on various operating systems.
#      Jigdo allows you to download from any one of over 300 Debian mirrors
#      worldwide, and create the images after that.
#      <br>
#      Note that jigdo is the only way to download Debian DVD images.
#  </li>
#  <li><a href="../CD/torrent-cd/">Download CD images with BitTorrent</a>:
#      The Bittorrent peer to peer system lets many users cooperatively
#      download images at the same time, with minimal load on our servers.
#  <li><a href="../CD/http-ftp/">Fetch full CD images</a>:
#      If you are unable to use BitTorrent or jigdo, you'll have to download
#      the 650 MB large image files via HTTP or FTP. There are fewer mirrors of
#      these images due to space and bandwidth constraints, so these downloads
#      can be quite slow.
#      <br>
#      If possible, please use <a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> instead.
#  </li>
#</ul>
#
#<p>In case of problems, please check the <a href="../CD/faq/">frequently
#asked/answered questions about Debian CDs</a>.</p>
