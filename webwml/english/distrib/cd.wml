#use wml::debian::template title="Installing Debian GNU/Linux via CD images" BARETITLE=true

<p>If you have access to a permanent connection to the Internet, you can
download CD image files there, create CDs using those images and install
Debian from those CDs.</p>

<p>There are two options for getting the CD images:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">Assemble images using jigdo</a>:
      Instead of getting a lot of large image files, you use a special
      application called "jigdo", which works on various operating systems.
      Jigdo allows you to download from any one of over 300 Debian mirrors
      worldwide, and create the images after that.
      <br>
      Note that jigdo is the only way to download Debian DVD images.
  </li>
  <li><a href="../CD/http-ftp/">Fetch full CD images</a>:
      If you are unable to use jigdo, you'll have to download the 650 MB
      large image files via HTTP or FTP. There are less mirrors of these
      images due to space and bandwidth constraints, so these downloads can
      be quite slow.
      <br>
      If possible, please use <a href="../CD/jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> instead.
  </li>
</ul>
