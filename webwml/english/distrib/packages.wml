<P><DT><A HREF="$(HOME)/Packages/stable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>stable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This is the latest official release of the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution, also referred to as `<EM>Main</EM>'. All packages are free
  according to the <A HREF="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
  Software Guidelines</A>, assuring free use and redistribution of the
  packages and their complete source code.

  <P>There are also some additions to the <EM>main</EM> distribution, that
  have certain restrictions not allowing them to be part of a 100% free
  software distribution like Debian GNU/Linux. Still, they are provided by
  Debian as a service to our users, and they include:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><DL>
    <DT><EM>Contrib</EM></DT>
      <DD>Packages in this area are free themselves but depend on other
      software or hardware that is not free.</DD>
    <DT><EM>Non-Free</EM></DT>
      <DD>Packages in this area do not necessarily cost money, but have some
      onerous license condition restricting use or redistribution of the
      software.</DD>
    <DT><EM>Non-US/Main</EM> and <EM>Non-US/Non-Free</EM></DT>
      <DD>These packages cannot be exported from the USA, they are mostly
      encryption software packages, or software that is encumbered by
      patent issues. Most of them are free, but some are non-free.</DD>

# I like the idea of using perl to automatically decide which version is available.
# Since potato was just released, I'm taking the easy road and commenting the following
# out. When this is fixed, make sure a dependency is added to the Makefile so
# it builds correctly

#<P><DT><A HREF="$(HOME)/Packages/frozen/">View the packages in the
#       <STRONG>frozen</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
#  <DD>This is a temporary designation a release goes through when in
#  the testing stage, just prior to being released as the new stable
#  distribution.</DD>

<P><DT><A HREF="$(HOME)/Packages/unstable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>unstable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This area contains packages that are destined to become part of the
  stable distribution above. They have either not been fully tested (and
  could therefore break your system) or have not been around long enough
  to make it into the stable distribution.</DD>
