<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/stable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>stable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This is the latest official release of the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution, also referred to as `<EM>Main</EM>'. All packages are free
  according to the <A HREF="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
  Software Guidelines</A>, assuring free use and redistribution of the
  packages and their complete source code.

  <P>There are also some additions to the <EM>main</EM> distribution, that
  have certain restrictions not allowing them to be part of a 100% free
  software distribution like Debian GNU/Linux. Still, they are provided by
  Debian as a service to our users, and they include:
    <BLOCKQUOTE><DL>
    <DT><EM>Contrib</EM></DT>
      <DD>Packages in this area are free themselves but depend on other
      software that is not free.</DD>
    <DT><EM>Non-Free</EM></DT>
      <DD>Packages in this area do not necessarily cost money, but have some
      onerous license condition restricting use or redistribution of the
      software.</DD>
    <DT><EM>Non-US/Main</EM> and <EM>Non-US/Non-Free</EM></DT>
      <DD>These packages cannot be exported from the USA, they are mostly
      encryption software packages, or software that is encumbered by
      patent issues. Most of them are free, but some are non-free.</DD>

  <DD>This is a temporary designation a release goes through when in
  the testing stage, just prior to being released as the new stable
  distribution.

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/testing/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>testing</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This area contains packages that are destined to become part of the
  next stable distribution.  Packages that haven't been included from
  unstable (see below) have not been around long enough to make it
  into the testing distribution or depend on packages which are not
  part of this distribution yet.

  <P>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/testing/">testing distribution pages</A>
  for more information.

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>unstable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This area contains packages that are currently developed by
  Debian.  All new packages and updates are uploaded to this
  distribution.  Once a package stabilizes, doesn't have any more release
  critical bugs than the version in testing and its dependencies are fulfilled in testing, it is
  copied to the testing distribution.  Packages in unstable are
  generally untested and could
  have severe bugs (some that might even cause damage to your system).</DD>

<P>Note that same packages might appear in several distributions, but with
different version numbers.
