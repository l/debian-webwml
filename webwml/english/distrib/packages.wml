<p>All packages that are included in the official Debian distribution are
free according to the <a href="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>. This assures free use and redistribution of the
packages and their complete source code. The official Debian distribution
is what is contained in the <em>main</em> section of the Debian archive.</p>

<p>As a service to our users, we also provide packages in separate sections
that cannot be included in the <em>main</em> distribution due to either a
restrictive license or legal issues. They include:</p>

    <div class="centerblock">
    <dl>
    <dt><em>Contrib</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area are freely licensed by the copyright
      holder but depend on other software that is not free.</dd>
    <dt><em>Non-Free</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area have some onerous license condition
      restricting use or redistribution of the software.</dd>
    </dl>
    </div>

<p>Note that same packages might appear in several distributions, but with
different version numbers.</p>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/stable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>stable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This is the latest official release of the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes
  only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.

  <P>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable release pages</A>
  for more information.

  <br>&nbsp;
  </DD>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/testing/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>testing</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This area contains packages that are intended to become part of the next stable distribution.
  There are strict criteria a package in unstable (see below) must obey before
  it can be added to testing.
  Note that "testing" does not get the timely security updates
  <a href="../security/faq#testing">from the security team</a>.

  <P>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/testing/">testing distribution pages</A>
  for more information.

  </DD>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>unstable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <dd><p>This area contains the most recent packages in Debian. Once a
  package has met our criterion for stability and quality of packaging,
  it will be included in testing. "unstable" is also not supported
  <a href="../security/faq#testing">by the security team</a>.</p>

  <p>Packages in unstable are the least tested and may contain
  problems severe enough to affect the stability of your system.
  Only experienced users should consider using this distribution.</p>

  <p>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/unstable/">unstable
  distribution pages</A> for more information.</p></dd>
