<p>
All packages that are included in the official Debian distribution are
free according to the <a href="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>. This assures free use and redistribution of the
packages and their complete source code. The official Debian distribution
is what is contained in the <em>main</em> section of the Debian archive.
</p>

<p>
As a service to our users, we also provide packages in separate sections
that cannot be included in the <em>main</em> distribution due to either a
restrictive license or legal issues. They include:
</p>

<div class="centerblock">
  <dl>
    <dt><em>Contrib</em></dt>
    <dd>
    Packages in this area are freely licensed by the copyright
    holder but depend on other software that is not free.
    </dd>
    <dt><em>Non-Free</em></dt>
    <dd>
    Packages in this area have some onerous license condition
    restricting use or redistribution of the software.
    </dd>
  </dl>
</div>

<p>
Note that same packages might appear in several distributions, but with
different version numbers.

    <strong>stable</strong> distribution</a></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This is the latest official release of the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes
  only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.
  </p>

  <p>
  See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable release pages</a>
  for more information.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="http://packages.debian.org/testing/">View the packages in the
    <strong>testing</strong> distribution</a></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This area contains packages that are intended to become part of the next
  stable distribution.  There are strict criteria a package in unstable (see
  below) must obey before it can be added to testing.
  Note that <q>testing</q> does not get the timely security updates
  <a href="../security/faq#testing">from the security team</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/testing/">testing distribution pages</a>
  for more information.
  </p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/">View the packages in the
    <strong>unstable</strong> distribution</a></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>
  This area contains the most recent packages in Debian. Once a
  package has met our criterion for stability and quality of packaging,
  it will be included in testing. <q>unstable</q> is also not supported
  <a href="../security/faq#unstable">by the security team</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
  Packages in unstable are the least tested and may contain
  problems severe enough to affect the stability of your system.
  Only experienced users should consider using this distribution.
  </p>

  <p>
  See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/unstable/">unstable
  distribution pages</a> for more information.
