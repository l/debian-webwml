<p>All packages that are included in the official Debian distribution are
free according to the <a href="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free
Software Guidelines</a>. This assures free use and redistribution of the
packages and their complete source code. The official Debian distribution
is what is contained in the <em>main</em> section of the Debian archive.</p>

<p>As a service to our users, we also provide packages in separate sections
that can not be included in the <em>main</em> distribution due to either a
restrictive license or legal issues. They include:</p>

    <blockquote><dl>
    <dt><em>Contrib</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area are freely licensed by the copyright
      holder but depend on other software that is not free.</dd>
    <dt><em>Non-Free</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area have some onerous license condition
      restricting use or redistribution of the software.</dd>
    <dt><em>Non-US/Main</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area are free themselves but cannot be
      exported from a server in the U.S.</dd>
    <dt><em>Non-US/Non-Free</em></dt>
      <dd>Packages in this area have some onerous license condition
      restricting use or redistribution of the software.  They cannot
      be exported from the U.S. because they are encryption software
      packages that are not handled by the export control procedure
      that is used for the packages in Main or they cannot be stored
      on a server in the U.S because they are encumbered by patent
      issues.</dd>
    </dl></blockquote>

<p>Note that same packages might appear in several distributions, but with
different version numbers.</p>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/stable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>stable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This is the latest official release of the Debian GNU/Linux
  distribution. This is stable and well tested software, which changes
  only if major security or usability fixes are incorporated.

  <P>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable release pages</A>
  for more information.

  <br>&nbsp;
  </DD>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/testing/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>testing</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <DD>This area contains packages that are intended to become part of the next stable distribution.
  There are strict criteria a package in unstable (see below) must obey before
  it can be added to testing.
  Note that "testing" does not get the timely security updates
  <a href="../security/faq#testing">from the security team</a>.

  <P>See the <a href="$(HOME)/releases/testing/">testing distribution pages</A>
  for more information.

  </DD>

<DT><A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/">View the packages in the
       <STRONG>unstable</STRONG> distribution</A></DT>
  <dd><p>This area contains the most recent packages in Debian. Once a
  package has met our criterion for stability and quality of packaging,
  it will be included in testing. "unstable" is also not supported
  <a href="../security/faq#testing">by the security team</a>.</p>

  <p>Packages in unstable are the least tested and may contain
  problems severe enough to affect the stability of your system.
  Only experienced users should consider using this distribution.</p></dd>
