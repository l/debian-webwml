<P>Debian GNU/Linux is available on an FTP site near you:
<ftpmirrors>

<P>You may want to look at the full <A href="$(MISC)/README.mirrors">list of
mirrors</A> to find the machine closest to you. Note that geographic
proximity is often not very reliable for determining which machine will
serve you best. You can experiment to find the one that is best for you.

<P>Also, there are sites that hold software that can not be distributed in
the US (and other countries) due to restrictions on export of cryptography
or software patents. The list of these sites can be found in the file
<A HREF="$(MISC)/README.non-US">README.non-US</A>. Debian can not dispense
legal advice so every user must decide for themself whether they may use the
software in our `non-US' sections.

<P>If you can find a site near you, please use it to download Debian.
It will probably work faster, and will reduce the load on our servers and
on the Internet as a whole.

<P>Old stable releases of Debian can be found in the
<A HREF="archive">archive</a>.

<P>Last but not least, take a look at <A href="../doc/">Debian
documentation</A> for information on how to install and use Debian, or
subscribe to <A HREF="../MailingLists/subscribe#debian-user">debian-user</A>
mailing list and ask questions there.
