<P>Debian GNU/Linux is available for download over the Internet. The
distribution is available in two forms: as a collection of packages,
and as ISO 9660 CD images. If you don't know if you need the CD images or
the packages, please see the <a href="../CD/">CD images
web pages</a> for more information. (You can also download the images
<a href="../CD/">there</a>.)

<p>Debian GNU/Linux is distributed (<em>mirrored</em>) on hundreds of
servers on the Internet. Using a nearby server will probably speed up your
download, and also reduce the load on our central servers and on the
Internet as a whole.

<P>To download Debian GNU/Linux, choose a mirror site near you:
<ftpmirrors>

<P>You may want to look at the full <A href="$(MISC)/README.mirrors">list of
mirrors</A> to find the server closest to you.

<p>Note that geographic
proximity is often not very reliable for determining which machine will
serve you best. You can experiment to find the one that is best for you.
Programs such as <a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/net/netselect.html">\
netselect</a> can be of help with this.

<P>Also, there are sites that hold software that can not be distributed in
the US (and other countries) due to restrictions on export of cryptography
or software patents. Debian can not dispense legal advice so every user must
decide for themself whether they may use the software in our `non-US'
sections.

<P>To download Debian GNU/Linux non-US packages, choose a mirror site near you:
<nonusmirrors>

<P>For a complete listing of the sites that mirror Debian non-US packages,
please see the <A HREF="$(MISC)/README.non-US">README.non-US</A> file.

<hrline>

<P>Old stable releases of Debian can be found in the
<A HREF="archive">archive</a>.

<P>Last but not least, take a look at <A href="../doc/">Debian
documentation</A> for information on how to install and use Debian.
Check the <a href="../support">support resources</a> as well.
