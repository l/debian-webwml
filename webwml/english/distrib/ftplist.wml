<P>Debian GNU/Linux is available on an FTP site near you:
<ftpmirrors>

<P>You may want to look at the full
<A href="$(MISC)/README.mirrors">list of mirrors</A>
to find the machine closest to you. Note that geographic proximity is often
not very reliable for determining which machine will serve you best. You can
experiment to find the one that is best for you.

<P>Also, there are sites that hold software that can not be distributed in the US
due to restrictions on export or software patents.
The list of these sites can be found in the file
<A href="$(MISC)/README.non-US">README.non-US</A>.
Debian can not dispense legal advice so every user must decide for themself
whether the software in non-US is usable.

<P>If you can find a site near you, please use it to download Debian.
It will probably work faster, and will reduce the load on our servers and
on the Internet as a whole.

<P>Last but not least, take a look at the
<A href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/install.html">Instructions
for Installing Debian</A>.
If you need additional help, be sure to look at the other
<A href="$(DOC)/">Debian documentation</A> or subscribe to
<A href="$(HOME)/support#mail_lists">debian-user</A> and ask questions there.
