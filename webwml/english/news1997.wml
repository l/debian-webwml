<H2><A name="19971211">11 Dec 1997: Debian Available Pre-installed on New Computers</A></H2>

<P>We're happy to announce a computer manufacturer that supports Debian.
<A href="http://www.varesearch.com/">VA Research</A> is offering Debian
pre-installed at no extra charge on all of the computer systems they sell:
laptops, workstations, and file servers. You can see the products at
<A href="http://www.varesearch.com/">http://www.varesearch.com/</A>.
VA has donated a system and a high-bandwidth network connection to Debian.
Here's some information on a system on sale this month that includes a
Debian donation.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We have a new system.  It's a VArStation 25 - a dual capable Pentium II
system, available with either one or two 233, 266, or 300Mhz cpus.  It's an
ide based system, and we're pricing the whole thing starting at $2200
including a Matrox card, 64 megabytes of ram, and a SoundBlaster.

<P>There are a few upgrades...bigger disk, more ram, better graphics, etc.
It's a good system because people can start with a single processor and
some ram, and add a second processor and double their ram later.

<P>In order to help Debian, we are going to donate 2% of the price of any
VArStation 25 system ordered in December with Debian pre-installed.

<H2><A name="19971130">30 Nov 1997: Debian Announces $1000 Grant to Gnome Project</A></H2>

<P>The Debian GNU/Linux Distribution is getting enough donations now that we
can support the development of free software. We use most donations for our
own work, but some outside projects are worth funding.

<P>Debian is awarding $1000 to the GNOME project (see
<A href="http://www.gnome.org">http://www.gnome.org</A>). They
are building a GUI desktop for Linux and Unix systems. In addition, we
have granted GNOME use of Debian's servers so that they need not spend
any of the $1000 on internet services. We chose the GNOME project
because:

<OL>
<LI>They are using 100% free software.
<LI>They have an excellent design and have shown rapid progress.
<LI>They are doing the right thing, and that should be rewarded.
</OL>

<P>This won't be the last Debian grant. To qualify for support, all of the
software used by a project must conform to
<A href="social_contract#guidelines">Debian's
Free Software Guidelines</A>.
These assure that the software is free for use by _anyone_, not just Debian.

<P>If you're not familiar with Debian GNU/Linux, check out our web site at
<A href="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A>.

<H2><A name="19971125">25 Nov 1997: Become a Debian Developer! Debian Mentors are waiting to help you</A></H2>

<P>Do you want to see your software fly on the Space Shuttle? Want to see it
used in classrooms and companies everywhere? Want to give something back
for all of the great free software that others have contributed? Want to
be part of the best project in the free software world, with lots of smart
people to work with?

<P><STRONG>*** BECOME A DEBIAN DEVELOPER ***</STRONG>

<P>Be a technical writer, a package maintainer, or a programmer.

<P>Now, it's easier than ever to become a Debian developer, because we've
set up "mentors" - experienced Debian staff who will guide you
through the process. You can meet them on the Debian Mentors mailing
list. To subscribe, send a message to
debian-mentors-REQUEST@lists.debian.org with the word "subscribe" in
the body.

<P>About the easiest way to become a developer is to adopt a software
package. You can find a list of software packages that need maintainers at
<A href="doc/prospective-packages.html">http://www.debian.org/doc/prospective-packages.html</A>.

<P>You can find more information in our
"<A href="developers_corner">Developer's Corner</A>".
Documents here include the Debian Policy Manual and the Debian Packaging
Manual, key references for every Debian package maintainer.

<H2><A name="19971115">15 Nov 1997: Linux Distributions and The Free
Software Community &mdash; a note from the president of Debian</A></H2>

<P>We of the Debian project produce a high-quality 100% free-software Linux
system. But, as volunteers, we have another job, too - Debian helps keep
the commercial Linux distributors "honest" by providing a non-commercial
alternative for them to be compared against.

<P>There is a "Social Contract" in the free software community. Good members
take value from it in the form of free software that others have
contributed, and _return_ value for what they have taken in the form of
free software that they have developed. Bad members just take.

<P>Is your Linux Distribution honoring the social contract? You can find
Debian's policy at
<A href="social_contract">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</A>.
This provides a statement of what we will give back to the free software
community, and our guidelines for what is free software and what's not
quite free. We published this about half a year ago, expecting other
Linux distributions to also state in writing how they were going to
treat the free software community. So far, no other Linux distribution
has made that statement.

<P>If you run a Linux system other than Debian, we urge you to ask them
for a copy of their "Social Contract" in writing. We'd like you to be
able to compare all Linux systems on the basis of how they are treating
the free software community.

<P>The November issue of Boot Magazine includes a 240MB subset of Debian 1.3.1
on CD. Once your system is installed, you can use dselect's FTP mode to
upgrade to the full system. The issue is priced at $7.99 U.S. and $8.99
Canada. There's also a feature on alternative operating systems, including
Linux, that goes into the fundamentals of free software.
You should be able to find Boot wherever computer magazines are sold.

<H2><A name="19971020">20 Oct 1997: First Book on Debian Published</A></H2>

<P>Linux Press has announced the publication of <EM>The Debian Linux
User's Guide</EM>.
This 250 page book comes with the 2 CD-ROM Debian "Official" GNU/Linux 1.3.1,
a third CD-ROM with a customized version of Debian 1.3.1, and
30 Days of E-mail Technical Support.
<P>For those in the US, it should be available in Borders' bookstores.
It can also be ordered directly from the publisher or can be found
at a good computer store that carries Linux CDs.
Of course you will want to run out and buy a copy, but Linux Press
is offering an
<A href="http://www.linuxpress.com/">HTML version of the book</A> at
their web site.

<HR>
<H2><A name="19971010">10 Oct 1997: Unix-on-Intel players work on a common binary format</A></H2>

<P>Dear Debian users and developers,

<P>Here's an announcement from the 86open project, a project to make
binary compatibility across all Unix variants on Intel architectures.
In short, it's an effort to support ELF LIBC6 executables on all of the
platforms, so that vendors can build a single application that runs on
all Intel Unix variants. As you can see from the announcement, this
project already has a substantial amount of commercial support.

<P>I think this has much more of a chance to succeed where previous Unix
standardization efforts have fallen short. Rather than produce a paper
standard, the project will release a reference implementation that runs
on the various platforms. Because this will be free software, the cost
of implementing compatibility will be much lower than that of
implementing new software to run a paper standard.

<P>The fact that commercial Unix vendors are turning to free software for
this solution is a real triumph for the free software movement, and one
I expect to see repeated. I'm happy to see the major Linux distributions
represented on the steering committee along with the largest commercial
Unix vendors, and I'm proud to represent Debian on this project.

<PRE>
        Thanks

<P>Since the start of the Debian Official CD program, just 8 weeks ago,
over 2200 2-CD sets have been sold. The number may well be higher, as
companies are not required to tell us about their sales. About half of
the reported sales are mail-order. Approximately US$3000 in donations
have been made so far by CD purchasers, and the checks have started to
come in from the CD vendors. A list of CD vendors can be found on our
web site,
<A href="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</A>. Anyone can duplicate and sell the
Debian 1.3.1 Official 2-CD Set. For information, see

committed to donate systems and high-bandwidth net connections to the
Debian Development. Information on the donors will appear on the Debian
web site once the systems are "on the air". Several other sites offered
to donate space on an existing system, a net connection, or mail
delivery services. All of Debian's internet services are donated to the

<H2><A name="19970710">10 Jul 1997: Debian Converting to "GNU LIBC 6"</A></H2>

<P>The Debian group is busy building Debian 2.0, its first distribution
based on GNU LIBC 6 for all platforms, including the i386. LIBC 6
re-unites the Linux C library with the GNU C library used on other
platforms, and improves compatibility of Linux with POSIX standards.
The Debian 2.0 developmental snapshot is at
<A href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm</A>,
this is not yet a working system.
If you would like to help with this development, please read the
developer's manuals at
<A href="http://www.debian.org/doc/">http://www.debian.org/doc/</A>.

<P>Debian 2.0 will continue to support the LIBC 5 applications that currently
run under Debian 1.3 and other Linux distributions.

<HR>
<H2><A name="19970708">8 Jul 1997: Debian 1.3.1 Released</A></H2>

<P>Debian GNU/Linux 1.3.1 is now available on our 79 FTP sites. In
addition, our Official 2-CD Set is available for you to duplicate
and sell (or give away) with no fee from us.

<P>The main difference from 1.3 to 1.3.1 is the inclusion of XFree86 3.3 .
This solves a number of known security bugs and other problems in X.
There are also bug-fixes to several other packages.

<P>You can find the Official Debian GNU/Linux 1.3.1 2-CD Set for sale at
excellent prices. Please see
<A href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors</A>
for a listing of CD vendors.

<P>If you already have a 1.3 CD, you may find it most economical to update
your system to 1.3.1 automatically from one of our 79 FTP mirror sites.
You can do this using Dselect's FTP installation method.
You can also download and install Debian for the first time using FTP.
A listing of mirror sites can be found
<A href="misc/README.mirrors">here</A>.

<P>If you would like to duplicate and sell the Official Debian 1.3.1 2-CD Set,
you can download the ISO 9660 image files from one of several

their work on incorporation.

<P>Tim and Frank will now petition the United States Internal Revenue Service
to grant us 501(c)3 tax-exempt non-profit status. When completed, this will
allow donations to Debian to be deductible for those who file U.S. federal
tax returns. We expect to expend $1500 to $2000 in legal fees on this
process, which is more than we currently have in our treasury. Please see
