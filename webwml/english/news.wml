<HR>
<H2><A NAME="19980724">24 Jul 1998: Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Released</A></H2>
<P>Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' has officially been released for the i386 
and m68k architectures.

<P>It can be obtained in several ways:
<ul>
<li>FTP:       <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/</a>
<li>CD-ROM:    <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors</a> (list of distributors)
<li>CD Images: <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">http://cdimage.debian.org/</a>
</ul>

<P>Debian 2.0 contains over 1500 precompiled binary packages contributed 
from over 400 developers, including all of the favorites: web servers, 
GIMP, gcc, egcs, XFree86, SQL servers and many other tools and utilities.
It also marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.

<P>Debian's powerful package manager 'dpkg' allows for easy installation, 
maintenance and updating of packages including sophisticated handling of
dependencies and configurations.  Packages from other distributions can 
easily be installed using the 'alien' utility.

<P>Debian development distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also 
available under the 'unstable' tree from the FTP site.  They will likely
be released with Debian 2.1 'Slink.'  Development is currently in 
progress for UltraSparc, Netwinder and Hurd based distributions.


<h3>Why Debian GNU/Linux?</H3>

<ul>
 <li>Debian is 100% Free Software. Our goal is to help keep Linux free.
 <li>Over 1500 precompiled software packages.
 <li>Over 400 developers, the largest staff of any Linux distribution.
 <li>The largest pre-release testing program in the Linux world.
 <li>Free on-line support from our large, friendly user community on the
   debian-user mailing list and interactive chat forums.
 <li>Floppy-less install directly from CD, or single floppy install
   using NFS or hard disk.
 <li>Automatic upgrades via CD, FTP, NFS, or disk.
 <li>Bug tracking system is publicly accessible on our web server, and
   users are encouraged to access the system and provide feedback.
 <li>Anyone can duplicate and sell our Official CD or a snapshot of the
   FTP archive, at no charge!
 <li>Compatible with RPM and Slackware packages.
</ul>


<h3>Upgrade Information</h3>

<P>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a specific upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describing this procedure can be found at:
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/HOWTO.upgrade">http://www.debian.org/2.0/HOWTO.upgrade</a>
</blockquote>

There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
<ol>
  <li>autoup.sh<br>
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is in the developers corner
     of the Debian web site, but newer versions are at:
     <ul>
        <li><a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/">http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/hamm/hamm/upgrade-i386/</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a>
        <li><a href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a>
     </ul>
  <li>apt-get<br>
       This is the command line part of Debian's future
     package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
     download them from a local archive, http, and FTP sites.  It is
     able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use a CD,
     an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
     speed, variety, and latest versions.  
     Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  
     The 'Bo' version is at: <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>
     or you can get the <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/apt-get.bo.current.deb">latest .deb directly</a>.
     The 'Hamm' version is in project/experimental.
  <li>By hand</br>
       A HOWTO can be found at
     <a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">http://www.debian.org/2.0/autoup/HOWTO/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>
     but as the autoup.sh simply automates this process this is the
     least convenient option.

<H2><A NAME="19980624">24 Jun 1998: Debian v2.0 ("Hamm") Beta Test</A></H2>
<P>Though significantly delayed, Debian 2.0 ("Hamm") has officially been released
as "beta" for the i386 and m68k architectures.  The packages on ftp.debian.org
are up to date and ready for downloads.  Mirror sites are busy catching up on
the last few changes and should be complete by the end of the day (Thursday
morning at the absolute latest).

<P>Debian 2.0 marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.  Since
this is a significant change, we took a long time to make sure everything
was working correctly.

<P>Changes to Hamm are restricted to important bug fixes so you should encounter
relatively few changes between now and the official release.  I would
encourage those interested to go ahead with the Debian 1.3 ("Bo") to 2.0
upgrade.  This final bit of testing should help eliminate the remaining
upgrade/install problems likely to be encountered.

<P>Debian distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also available under
the "unstable" tree.  They will likely release with Debian 2.1.

<P>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp (due
to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), it is recommended that the following
upgrade procedure be followed.  This document can be found at

<a href="http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq">http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq</a>
and
<a href="2.0/upgrade.faq">on the current site</a>.

<P>Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version of Debian?<BR>

      the correct order, even download the deb's for you.  Because of
      the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the

      <a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
         (ftp: also okay)
   <LI>apt-get - This is the command line part of Debian's future
      package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
      download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
      able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use your
      cd, an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
      speed, variety, and recentness (if you can't tell, I like this
      one).  Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  The bo
      version is at: <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>
      and <a href="2.0/apt-get.gz">on the current site</a>.
      The hamm version is in project/experimental.

      want to do this.

<H2><A NAME="19980606">6 Jun 1998: Kachina Technologies, Inc. to help Debian Sparc
       development</A></H2>
<P>Kachina Technologies, Inc. (<a href="http://kachinatech.com">http://kachinatech.com</a>)
has decided to help 
make the Debian Sparc distribution commercially available to Linux 
community.  When ready, the Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Sparc distribution 
will be offered by Kachina on both CD-ROM and on preinstalled systems as 
well.

<P>When asked about their work with Linux, Ward Deng of Kachina stated:

<P>"[Kachina] has been working on UltraSPARC systems and Linux for many years 
and realized UltraSPARC and Linux is the best combination for 
high-performance computing users. We have demonstrated an UltraLinux cluster 
at a trade show and drew a lot of attention.

<P>"We have been working on a native port of high-performance development 
environment including Fujitsu Fortran 90, C, and other compiler/tools on the 
Linux/UltraSPARC platform.

<P>"We have been supporting UltraLinux port by providing loan systems to key 
Sparc/Linux developers and we will continue doing so. Not only we will 
provide remote access and network resource to Debian/UltraLinux developers, 
we also intend to provide developers or early users preloaded systems at 
prices below their costs to show our support and appreciation."

<P>When asked why Debian was the distribution of choice, the reply was:

<P>"Debian is obviously the best distribution so far. The Debian packaging 
system and its organized volunteer-based development made it more 
maintainable and guaranteed its openness in a long run."

<P>Kachina is providing Internet access, disk space, a publicly accessible 
test system, as well as manpower on software packaging and testing to help 
the Debian Sparc effort.

<P>Kachina also hosts Scientific Applications on Linux (SAL) 
(http://sal.kachinatech.com), which is a collection of information and links 
to software that is useful to scientists and engineers.

<P>Debian GNU/Linux has been working on a Sparc distribution since November 
1996.  This distribution is expected to be ready for release within the next 
few months.

<P>For more information regarding Debian Sparc development, please subscribe to 
the Debian Sparc mailing list

<H2><A NAME="19980408">9 Apr 1998: Debian to Use Only Free Versions of the X Window
          System</A></H2>
<P>We are dismayed by the recent decision by the `Open Group' not to
release future versions of X as free software - there will be
restrictions on commercial use, including large fees.

<P>Debian's Social Contract promises that we will only promote software
which meets our Free Software Guidelines.  These Guidelines require
availability for commercial as well as noncommercial use.

<P>Debian cannot therefore ship versions of X derived from X11R6.4.
Instead we will base our releases on X11R6.3 (which is free);
we are confident that the free software community will rise to the
challenge of developing further free versions based on X11R6.3.

<P>We note that XFree86 are currently considering their response to this
situation.  We sincerely hope that they will retain their alignment
with the fully-free software community by not putting further work
into the new closed X distribution from the `Open Group'.

<P>We would also encourage commercial vendors (whether aligned with the
free software community or not) to express their commitment to keep X
free.

<P>The duplication of effort and loss of standardization involved in
splitting the development of X is unfortunate, but has been made
inevitable by the Open Group's decision to take X away from the free
software community.

<P>The codefreeze for Debian 2.0, the libc6 system, is now in place,

<P>There has been some confusion regarding Bruce Perens's relationship
with SPI (Software in the Public Interest, Debian's support and
umbrella organization).  Bruce is the President of SPI, and felt he
was unhappy with certain aspects of the Debian Project's work.  Ian
Murdock, Tim Sailer and I - the other board members of SPI - are
currently discussing with Bruce the future direction of SPI, and SPI's
relationship with Debian, and there is an ongoing discussion within
the Debian Project about these issues.

<P>However, this will not distract us from our progress towards releasing
2.0.  The Debian Project has a long tradition of apparent political
instability shortly before making releases, so you can be optimistic !

<H2><A NAME="19980306a">6 Mar 1998: Announcement About the Debian Trademark</A></H2>
<P>Debian's goal is to be fair to all businesses. Part of that is not
giving one business an advantage over another.

<P>We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the "Debian" trademark.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian GNU/Linux distribution,
you can call that product "Debian". If you want to use the name in some
other way, you should ask us _first_.

<P>To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no business use the name
"Debian" in the name of the business, or a domain name of the business.

<P>A few times well-meaning people have called us just a bit too late to
keep them from losing a few hundred dollars and some time and being
disappointed. In all cases these people have meant well, and have
approached us with gifts in hand, and it is a shame to disappoint them.
Hopefully, this warning will protect the next person.

write their license. You can find the draft Netscape license at

This is a historic day for us, since it

some parts that Netscape does not own that will probably have to be
replaced with free software.

<H2><A NAME="19980223">23 Feb 1998: MAPS: A Project Worthy of your Notice</A></H2>
<P>Like most heavy Internet users, Debian developers have been plagued by
e-mail "spam". Recently, spammers have been even been posting messages
to our online bug-reporting system. Sales messages have been popping up
in between the bug reports.

<P>Because of this, the Debian servers have joined MAPS, the Mail Abuse
Protection System. This is a network of system administrators that agree
to voluntarily refuse e-mail from sites that support spammers or have
poor anti-spam policies. Their web site is at
<A HREF="http://www.vix.com/">http://www.vix.com/</A>. MAPS
operates the Realtime Blackhole List. This is a system that allows them
to update the list of systems we refuse mail from instantly, and that
gives them the power to stop a spam in progress. Because so many systems
are participating, MAPS can get the attention of the offending sites and
can persuade them to reform their spam policies. MAPS also operates the
Transport Security Initiative, a program to educate innocent sites that
are used as relays by spammers in how to block spam.

<P>MAPS has improved the entire Internet, and it's worthy of your support.
We are working on improvements to the Debian mail programs so that Debian

<P>You can read about the AMSAT Phase 3-D satellite at
<A HREF="http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/phase3d.html">http://www.amsat.org/amsat/sats/phase3d.html</A>.
It's the most ambitious
in a long series of Ham Radio satellites (more than 30 have been
launched). Some of the software for the satellite's communications
systems and experiments was developed by Bdale Garbee N3EUA, a
long-time Debian developer, and other Radio Amateurs, using the Debian
system. Debian is a good match for AMSAT: they are both international
groups of private individuals contributing their work to highly
sophisticated technical projects

<H2><A NAME="19980203b">3 Feb 1998: Debian 2.0 Development Near Completion</A></H2>
<P>The Debian 2.0 boot floppy package has been uploaded and is being
tested, and large-scale testing of the system is expected to begin soon.
2.0 will feature the GNU C library 2.0, also known as "LIBC 6". Several
incremental releases are expected follow 2.0 at short intervals. The new
package manager meant to replace "dselect" is now being demonstrated, and
will probably appear in 2.1 or one of the early point releases.
<BR>[dselect will still be available for those who want to use it. The new
package manager will allow package installation from X or from a text terminal. -ed.]

<H2><A NAME="19980125b">25 Jan 1998: Debian Stability</A></H2>
<P>Debian's "master" system is a Pentium 90 with 64MB graciously provided
by one of our donors, Novare, who also donate its site in Texas, its support,
and its internet connection. It delivers over 100,000 e-mails daily,
runs the CVS server for the GNOME project, is our master FTP server
with many mirror systems accessing it every day, hosts our bug reporting
system and many project utilities, and is the "home" system of our 200
developers, who compile, upload, and download using that system every day.
This is a heavier load than people put on a single commercial workstation
running anything but Linux. A Microsoft NT system with a Pentium Pro and
128MB RAM would not approach the load this system handles effortlessly every
day. The system just ran continuously for three months without a reboot.

<P>The following quote is from Bruce Perens (past president of Debian and
board member of SPI) who works at Pixar:
<blockquote>I thought three months without a reboot was a big deal. When I mentioned
it to our developers, one of them showed me details about his system. It
was up for 458 days, and was halted to move it to another floor. The network
and disk device drivers had handled tens of millions of interrupts in that
time.</blockquote>

<H2><A NAME="19980125c">25 Jan 1998: Debian Affiliates</A></H2>
<P>The Berlin project, a project to make a next-generation window system,
has chosen to become part of Software in the Public Interest (Debian's
corporation). The project's timeline is about two years long.

<P>Debian is discussing collaboration with SEUL, a project to make a simple
end-user Linux for less-technical users than we presently support. See
their web page at
<A HREF="http://www.seul.org/">http://www.seul.org/</A>.

<H2><A NAME="19980104">4 Jan 1998: Debian and the Millennium Bug</A></H2>
<P>Since there seems to be widespread panic about the "millennium bug",
it seems appropriate to tell you about how your Debian
system might be affected.

<P>Unix and Linux do not store 2-digit dates, although it is possible for
an application to do so. They store dates as a count of seconds since
New Year's Day 1970. This counter will overflow about 40 years from now,
in early 2038, _not_ 2000.

<P>The few Debian applications that stored 2-digit dates have already been
repaired, and Debian systems have passed testing with their dates set
at 2000 and greater. There is one area in which Debian 1.3 is affected
but our upcoming 2.0 release will not be. Your PC's BIOS may only allow
you to set the PC's clock chip to a 2-digit date. This is a bug in your
PC's BIOS ROM, but we will provide a work-around in Debian so that you
don't have to buy a new motherboard. If you expect to run your 1.3 system
through the millennium, you can get a copy of the "hwclock" program from
2.0 and replace the "clock" program presently on your system.

<P>Before 2038 we must define "time_t", to be a 64-bit variable instead of
a 32-bit one, and recompile all programs. This is a very simple process
compared to the anguish the non-Unix world is going through - we go
through more work to produce a major release of Debian. Once time_t is
a 64 bit variable, it's good for roughly another 292271023017 years. By then,
there may be something better than Debian :-)

<H2><A NAME="19980101">1 Jan 1998: Happy New Year from the Debian Project</A></H2>
<P>1998 brings some changes for the Debian project. Ian Jackson is now
Debian project leader. Bruce Perens will continue as president of Software in the
Public Interest, Inc., and will work on such things as funding worthy
free software projects, external communications for the Debian project,
Open Hardware, and another SPI software project that might eventually be
as big as Debian.
