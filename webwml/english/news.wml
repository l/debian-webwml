<H2><A NAME="19980624">24 Jun 1998: Debian v2.0 ("Hamm") Beta Test</A></H2>
<P>Though significantly delayed, Debian 2.0 ("Hamm") has officially been released
as "beta" for the i386 and m68k architectures.  The packages on ftp.debian.org
are up to date and ready for downloads.  Mirror sites are busy catching up on
the last few changes and should be complete by the end of the day (Thursday
morning at the absolute latest).

<P>Debian 2.0 marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.  Since
this is a significant change, we took a long time to make sure everything
was working correctly.

<P>Changes to Hamm are restricted to important bug fixes so you should encounter
relatively few changes between now and the official release.  I would
encourage those interested to go ahead with the Debian 1.3 ("Bo") to 2.0
upgrade.  This final bit of testing should help eliminate the remaining
upgrade/install problems likely to be encountered.

<P>Debian distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also available under
the "unstable" tree.  They will likely release with Debian 2.1.

<P>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp (due
to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), it is recommended that the following
upgrade procedure be followed.  This document can be found at

<a href="http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq">http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq</a>
and
<a href="2.0/upgrade.faq">on the current site</a>.

<P>Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version of Debian?<BR>
A: There are several methods:
   <OL>
   <LI>autoup.sh - This is a script that will upgrade the programs in
      the correct order, even download the deb's for you.  Because of
      the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
      packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
      released is provided. 
      Versions are available at:<BR>
      <a href="2.0/autoup/">the current site</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
         (ftp: also okay)
   <LI>apt-get - This is the command line part of Debian's future
      package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
      download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
      able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use your
      cd, an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
      speed, variety, and recentness (if you can't tell, I like this
      one).  Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  The bo
      version is at: <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>
      and <a href="2.0/apt-get.gz">on the current site</a>.
      The hamm version is in project/experimental.
   <LI>Do it by hand.  There is a howto at:
      <a href="http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>
      but the autoup.sh simply automates this, so most users won't
      want to do this.
   </OL>

<H2><A NAME="19980606">6 Jun 1998: Kachina Technologies, Inc. to help Debian Sparc
       development</A></H2>
<P>Kachina Technologies, Inc. (<a href="http://kachinatech.com">http://kachinatech.com</a>)
has decided to help 
make the Debian Sparc distribution commercially available to Linux 
community.  When ready, the Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Sparc distribution 
will be offered by Kachina on both CD-ROM and on preinstalled systems as 
well.

<P>When asked about their work with Linux, Ward Deng of Kachina stated:

<P>"[Kachina] has been working on UltraSPARC systems and Linux for many years 
and realized UltraSPARC and Linux is the best combination for 
high-performance computing users. We have demonstrated an UltraLinux cluster 
at a trade show and drew a lot of attention.

<P>"We have been working on a native port of high-performance development 
environment including Fujitsu Fortran 90, C, and other compiler/tools on the 
Linux/UltraSPARC platform.

<P>"We have been supporting UltraLinux port by providing loan systems to key 
Sparc/Linux developers and we will continue doing so. Not only we will 
provide remote access and network resource to Debian/UltraLinux developers, 
we also intend to provide developers or early users preloaded systems at 
prices below their costs to show our support and appreciation."

<P>When asked why Debian was the distribution of choice, the reply was:

<P>"Debian is obviously the best distribution so far. The Debian packaging 
system and its organized volunteer-based development made it more 
maintainable and guaranteed its openness in a long run."

<P>Kachina is providing Internet access, disk space, a publicly accessible 
test system, as well as manpower on software packaging and testing to help 
the Debian Sparc effort.

<P>Kachina also hosts Scientific Applications on Linux (SAL) 
(http://sal.kachinatech.com), which is a collection of information and links 
to software that is useful to scientists and engineers.

<P>Debian GNU/Linux has been working on a Sparc distribution since November 
1996.  This distribution is expected to be ready for release within the next 
few months.

<P>For more information regarding Debian Sparc development, please subscribe to 
the Debian Sparc mailing list
&lt;<a href="mailto:debian-sparc@lists.debian.org">debian-sparc@lists.debian.org</A>&gt;.
This can be done at &lt;<a href="http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe">http://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe</a>&gt;.

<P>Hamm has now been deep-frozen.  Up until this point most new versions of
packages have have been allowed into the distribution as long as they were
bug fixes only. Now, the fix must both fix release-necessary bugs and
be deemed important enough by the head of engineering.

X11R6.4. The short story is that they will continue to develop XFree86 from

<H2><A NAME="19980408">9 Apr 1998: Debian to Use Only Free Versions of the X Window
          System</A></H2>
<P>We are dismayed by the recent decision by the `Open Group' not to
release future versions of X as free software - there will be
restrictions on commercial use, including large fees.

<P>Debian's Social Contract promises that we will only promote software
which meets our Free Software Guidelines.  These Guidelines require
availability for commercial as well as noncommercial use.

<P>Debian cannot therefore ship versions of X derived from X11R6.4.
Instead we will base our releases on X11R6.3 (which is free);
we are confident that the free software community will rise to the
challenge of developing further free versions based on X11R6.3.

<P>We note that XFree86 are currently considering their response to this
situation.  We sincerely hope that they will retain their alignment
with the fully-free software community by not putting further work
into the new closed X distribution from the `Open Group'.

<P>We would also encourage commercial vendors (whether aligned with the
free software community or not) to express their commitment to keep X
free.

<P>The duplication of effort and loss of standardization involved in
splitting the development of X is unfortunate, but has been made
inevitable by the Open Group's decision to take X away from the free
software community.

<H2><A NAME="19980325">25 Mar 1998: Code freeze (and rumours)</A></H2>
<P>The following is a message from the leader of Debian, Ian Jackson:
<blockquote>
<P>The codefreeze for Debian 2.0, the libc6 system, is now in place,
and alpha and beta testing will start very soon.

<P>There has been some confusion regarding Bruce Perens's relationship
with SPI (Software in the Public Interest, Debian's support and
umbrella organization).  Bruce is the President of SPI, and felt he
was unhappy with certain aspects of the Debian Project's work.  Ian
Murdock, Tim Sailer and I - the other board members of SPI - are
currently discussing with Bruce the future direction of SPI, and SPI's
relationship with Debian, and there is an ongoing discussion within
the Debian Project about these issues.

<P>However, this will not distract us from our progress towards releasing
2.0.  The Debian Project has a long tradition of apparent political
instability shortly before making releases, so you can be optimistic !

<H2><A NAME="19980316a">16 Mar 1998: SPI President to bring Free Software message to World

<H2><A NAME="19980316b">16 Mar 1998: Novare Contributes Hardware to Debian</A></H2>
<P>For a long time now Novare (<A HREF="http://www.novare.net">http://www.novare.net</A>)
has hosted the Debian
developer's central system. A few days ago, the motherboard on that system
blew out. They drove to the computer store on a Saturday, bought us a new
233MHz motherboard and new RAM, and rebuilt the system over that weekend.
Besides doing that, they built up a second system on their net for us to
use as a dedicated mailing-list server.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="19980306a">6 Mar 1998: Announcement About the Debian Trademark</A></H2>
<P>Debian's goal is to be fair to all businesses. Part of that is not
giving one business an advantage over another.

<P>We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the "Debian" trademark.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian GNU/Linux distribution,
you can call that product "Debian". If you want to use the name in some
other way, you should ask us _first_.

<P>To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no business use the name
"Debian" in the name of the business, or a domain name of the business.

<P>A few times well-meaning people have called us just a bit too late to
keep them from losing a few hundred dollars and some time and being
disappointed. In all cases these people have meant well, and have
approached us with gifts in hand, and it is a shame to disappoint them.
Hopefully, this warning will protect the next person.

<H2><A NAME="19980306b">6 Mar 1998: Netscape turns to Debian for Licensing Guidance!</A></H2>
<P>When Netscape decided to make their client software free, they
used the Debian Free Software Guidelines for a guide on how to
write their license. You can find the draft Netscape license at
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/">http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/</A>.
This is a historic day for us, since it
means that Netscape will eventually be in the "main" part of Debian
and all Linux systems, not the "non-free" section any longer!

<P>A link to a press release (containing a quote of yours truly) can
be found at the bottom of that page. The Debian Social Contract and
licensing guidelines are at
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/social_contract">http://www.debian.org/social_contract</A>.
A web page on the Open Source promotional program for free software can
be found at <A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/">http://www.opensource.org/</A>.

<P>There is work yet to be done - a few license bug-lets will be resolved
within the next few days, and once the source code is released there are
some parts that Netscape does not own that will probably have to be
replaced with free software.

<H2><A NAME="19980223">23 Feb 1998: MAPS: A Project Worthy of your Notice</A></H2>
<P>Like most heavy Internet users, Debian developers have been plagued by
e-mail "spam". Recently, spammers have been even been posting messages
to our online bug-reporting system. Sales messages have been popping up
in between the bug reports.

<P>Because of this, the Debian servers have joined MAPS, the Mail Abuse
Protection System. This is a network of system administrators that agree
to voluntarily refuse e-mail from sites that support spammers or have
poor anti-spam policies. Their web site is at
<A HREF="http://www.vix.com/">http://www.vix.com/</A>. MAPS
operates the Realtime Blackhole List. This is a system that allows them
to update the list of systems we refuse mail from instantly, and that
gives them the power to stop a spam in progress. Because so many systems
are participating, MAPS can get the attention of the offending sites and
can persuade them to reform their spam policies. MAPS also operates the
Transport Security Initiative, a program to educate innocent sites that
are used as relays by spammers in how to block spam.

<P>MAPS has improved the entire Internet, and it's worthy of your support.
We are working on improvements to the Debian mail programs so that Debian
users will be able join MAPS with a single command. If you want to join
now, you can do so using the instructions at the MAPS web site:

system and many project utilities, and is the "home" system of our 200
developers, who compile, upload, and download using that system every day.
This is a heavier load than people put on a single commercial workstation
running anything but Linux. A Microsoft NT system with a Pentium Pro and
128MB RAM would not approach the load this system handles effortlessly every
day. The system just ran continuously for three months without a reboot.

<P>The following quote is from Bruce Perens (past president of Debian and
board member of SPI) who works at Pixar:
<blockquote>I thought three months without a reboot was a big deal. When I mentioned
it to our developers, one of them showed me details about his system. It
was up for 458 days, and was halted to move it to another floor. The network
and disk device drivers had handled tens of millions of interrupts in that
time.</blockquote>

<P>The Berlin project, a project to make a next-generation window system,
has chosen to become part of Software in the Public Interest (Debian's
corporation). The project's timeline is about two years long.

<P>Debian is discussing collaboration with SEUL, a project to make a simple
end-user Linux for less-technical users than we presently support. See
their web page at
<A HREF="http://www.seul.org/">http://www.seul.org/</A>.

<H2><A NAME="19980104">4 Jan 1998: Debian and the Millennium Bug</A></H2>
<P>Since there seems to be widespread panic about the "millennium bug",
it seems appropriate to tell you about how your Debian
system might be affected.

<P>Unix and Linux do not store 2-digit dates, although it is possible for
an application to do so. They store dates as a count of seconds since
New Year's Day 1970. This counter will overflow about 40 years from now,
in early 2038, _not_ 2000.

<P>The few Debian applications that stored 2-digit dates have already been
repaired, and Debian systems have passed testing with their dates set
at 2000 and greater. There is one area in which Debian 1.3 is affected
but our upcoming 2.0 release will not be. Your PC's BIOS may only allow
you to set the PC's clock chip to a 2-digit date. This is a bug in your
PC's BIOS ROM, but we will provide a work-around in Debian so that you
don't have to buy a new motherboard. If you expect to run your 1.3 system
through the millennium, you can get a copy of the "hwclock" program from
2.0 and replace the "clock" program presently on your system.

<P>Before 2038 we must define "time_t", to be a 64-bit variable instead of
a 32-bit one, and recompile all programs. This is a very simple process
compared to the anguish the non-Unix world is going through - we go
through more work to produce a major release of Debian. Once time_t is
a 64 bit variable, it's good for roughly another 292271023017 years. By then,
there may be something better than Debian :-)

<H2><A NAME="19980101">1 Jan 1998: Happy New Year from the Debian Project</A></H2>
<P>1998 brings some changes for the Debian project. Ian Jackson is now
Debian project leader. Bruce Perens will continue as president of Software in the
Public Interest, Inc., and will work on such things as funding worthy
free software projects, external communications for the Debian project,
Open Hardware, and another SPI software project that might eventually be
as big as Debian.
