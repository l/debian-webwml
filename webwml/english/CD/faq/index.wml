<toc-add-entry name="what-is">What is a "CD image" anyway?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A CD image is the exact representation of the data on a CD in a
normal computer file, that can e.g. be transmitted over the
Internet. CD burning programs can use the image files to make real
CDs.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="mailing-list">My question is not answered by
this FAQ - how can I send mail to the mailing lists related to
Debian CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are several mailing lists that could be relevant to you.
In all cases, you should <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">search
the mailing list archives</a> before sending mail to the lists.
You can <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">subscribe</a>
to and <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>
from the lists. However, you do not need to be subscribed in order
to send mail to the lists - if you are not subscribed, ask for
replies to be CC'd to you.</p>

<p>Mailing lists relevant to problems with CD installation:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd</a>:
  Discussion about the CD image creation process, available CD
  mirrors, problems when booting from CD, announcements of new
  official images.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a>: A
  bit of a misnomer, this list actually covers the installation
  process; any problems encountered after successfully booting
  from CD may be more appropriate here than in debian-cd.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/">debian-user</a>:
  General support list for users of Debian GNU/Linux. Focus is
  more on problems encountered after a successful installation,
  when using the system. There are also several lists for
  non-English speakers, in <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-user-catalan/">Català</a>,

<toc-add-entry name="why-jigdo">Why do you encourage people not to
download CD images via HTTP/FTP, but instead with this "jigdo"
program or the "pseudo image kit"?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Today, there are over <a href="$(HOME)/misc/README.mirrors">200 Debian
mirrors</a> (which contain the complete Debian distribution as .deb files),
but <a href="../http-ftp/">far fewer</a> machines serving Debian CD images.
As a result, the CD image servers are constantly overloaded.</p>

<p>Additionally, nobody is very enthusiastic about setting up more
CD servers because of the tremendous amounts of wasted bandwidth
(some people keep <em>restarting</em> failed downloads instead of
<em>resuming</em> from the point where the connection was closed)
and because a regular mirror is more attractive (it allows
continuous upgrades of Debian, or using the "testing"/"unstable"
distribution instead of the "stable" one).</p>

<p>jigdo (and its predecessor, the pseudo image kit) tries to make
the most out of this situation, by downloading the data for the CD
images from one of the 200 mirrors. However, these mirrors only
hold individual .deb files, not the CD image, so some additional
manipulation of the data is necessary to produce one big CD image
file from the many small .deb files.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid to <a href="../jigdo-cd/">try out jigdo</a>!
The complex process of generating the CD image is completely
hidden from you - instead, you benefit from the fact that one of
the 200 Debian mirrors is bound to be nearer and faster than any
of the CD servers.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="which-cd">Which of the numerous CD images
should I download? Do I need all of them?</toc-add-entry>

<p>No, you only need the CD images for your computer's
architecture. The architecture is the type of hardware your
computer uses. By far the most popular one is the Intel
architecture, so most people will only want to get the images for
"i386".</p>

<p>Furthermore, in most cases it is not necessary to download all
of the images for your architecture. The packages on the CDs are
sorted by popularity: CD 1 contains the installation system and
the most popular packages. CD 2 contains slightly less popular
ones, CD 3 even less popular ones, etc. You will probably not need
CD 3 and higher unless you have very special requirements. (And in
case you happen to need a package later on which is not on one of
the CDs you downloaded, you can always install that package
directly from the Internet.)</p>

<p>Finally, for each architecture there are two versions of the
first CD, the normal and the non-US version. You only need one of
these! <a href="#nonus">See below</a> for details.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="source-cd">What are the "source" CDs? Do I
need them?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are two types of images, the "binary" CDs that contain
precompiled, ready-to-run programs, and the "source" CDs that
contain the source code for the programs. The vast majority of
people do not need the source CDs; you should not download them
unless you really have a good reason for it.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="nonus">What is the difference between the
normal binary-1 and the binary-1-nonus CD?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are two variants of the binary-1 CD, one with and one
without software of the "non-US" category. Non-US software may be
imported into the US without problems, but exporting it from the
US is forbidden by law (it contains strong cryptographic
code).</p>

<p>So basically everyone should fetch the non-US variant for
private use; the "non-non-US" variant is useful only for US-based
mirrors and US-based vendors that sell CDs internationally. The
binary-2 and binary-3 CDs do not contain any "US-sensitive"
software; they work perfectly well with either variant of the
binary-1 CD.</p>

<p>A similar story holds for the source-1 and source-1-nonus
variants.</p>

<p>A while ago, the US relaxed their legislation in this respect.
Hopefully the two separate versions of the first CD will not be
needed in future versions of Debian.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="nonfree">Where is the CD image with
non-free?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian has a quite strict view with regard to the licenses of
software: Only software that is Free in the sense of the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> is allowed into the actual distribution. All the other,
"non-free" software (for example, software for which source code is not
available) is not supported officially.</p>

<p>The official CDs may freely be used, copied and sold by anyone
anywhere in the world (but not always <em>to</em> anyone anywhere,
<a href="#nonus">see above</a>). Packages of the "non-free" (and
"non-US/non-free") category have restrictions that conflict with
this, so these packages are not placed on the official CDs.</p>

<p>Often, someone is kind enough to create unofficial non-free
CDs. If you cannot find any links on this website, you can try
<a href="#mailing-list">asking on the debian-cd mailing list</a>.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="dvd">Are any DVD images of the Debian
distribution available for download?</toc-add-entry>

<p>No, not at the moment, sorry! However, there are plans to offer
DVD images via jigdo at some point.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="live-cd">Is a Debian "live CD"
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A so-called "live CD" is a CD which contains a complete system
pre-installed on the CD. You do not need to install anything on the
harddisc, instead you boot from CD and are able to start working on
the machine right away. All programs run directly from CD.</p>

<p>There are <em>no</em> official Debian live CDs available. However,
we would like to recommend <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a>, which is based on
Debian - a very useful, full-featured live CD!</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="bootable">I notice all the CDs are bootable.
Is there any difference between the bootable parts of the
individual CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Yes, although this is only the case for the i386 architecture.
For other architectures, only the first CD is bootable (except for
<a href="$(HOME)/ports/arm/">arm</a>, where
<em>none</em> is).</p>

<p>Some hardware configurations of IBM compatible PCs require
Linux kernels with special options enabled or patches applied. If
your machine boots fine using the first binary CD, you do not need
to worry. Otherwise, try out the other CDs until you find one that
works:</p>

<ul>
  <li>binary-1: default (one-size-fits-all 2.2 kernel)</li>

  <li>binary-2: compact (smaller 2.2 kernel, with fewer options
  enabled)</li>

  <li>binary-3: bf2.4 (2.4 kernel with ext3 and ReiserFS support
  enabled)</li>

  <li>binary-4: idepci (2.2 kernel which only has IDE and PCI device
  support)</li>
</ul>

<p>These correspond to the different disk images on the FTP server
for <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/">\
stable</a> and
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/disks-i386/">\
testing</a>. If the Debian release only consists of fewer than
four CDs, you can still try booting from the missing boot disks:
<a href="$(HOME)/distrib/floppyinst">Write them to floppy disc</a> and try
booting from that.</p>

<p>It may also be possible that your BIOS offers you a choice of
boot options when you use the binary-1 CD. However, as of this
writing this feature is not enabled for the CD generation process
by default. Additionally, your BIOS needs to support it; many
BIOSes do not.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="arch">Where are the CDs for architecture
X?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Depending on the state of support for a certain architecture,
CD images are available from different places:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If the architecture you are looking for is officially
  supported by the current <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable
  release</a>, see the <a href="../">"Debian on CD"</a> page for
  the available download options.</li>

  <li>If a Debian port to a new architecture exists, but has not
  yet been released officially, CD images may or may not be
  available. See the <a href="http://cdimage-unofficial.debian.net">cdimage-unofficial</a>
  site for unofficial images of some of these architectures.</li>

  <li>For the Debian port to the GNU/Hurd, see the
  <a href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/hurd-cd">page about unofficial Hurd CDs</a>.

  <li>Otherwise, check the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">Debian port pages</a>
  for the architecture you are interested in.</li>

</ul>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="outdated">The software on the official CDs is
outdated - why don't you release a new version?</toc-add-entry>

<p>We only make official releases of the "stable" distribution
when we think they truly deserve that name. Unfortunately, this
means that stable releases only happen about every 1.5
years...</p>

<p>If you require more recent versions of some of the software in
Debian, you can install "stable" and then upgrade (via the net)
those parts you want to the versions from "testing" - it is
possible to mix software from the different releases.</p>

<p>Alternatively, try out the unofficial CD images of "testing"
that are generated automatically every week. However, note that
there is <em>no support for security problems</em> for "testing" -
in extreme cases, several weeks can go by before security holes
are fixed. <em>Do not use "testing" for servers!</em></p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="newest">How do I know if I am downloading the
newest CD images?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The note at the bottom of the <a href="../#latest">cdimage
homepage</a> always shows the version number of the latest
release.</p>

<p>As for mirror sites that offer direct HTTP/FTP downloads, most
use the "standard" scheme
<tt>/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;architecture&gt;/&lt;imagename&gt;.iso</tt>,
for example <tt>/2.2_rev4/i386/binary-i386-1.iso</tt> or
<tt>/2.2_rev4/source/source-1.iso</tt>. You can also verify on the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cd-images/">master site</a>
what the latest version number is. (Do not use any
<tt>/current/</tt> directory, as it is not always an alias for the
latest version of all architectures.)</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="verify">How can I verify that the downloaded
CD images are correct?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you use <a href="../jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>, the checksum of
the image is automatically verified after the image has been
generated.</p>

<p>For HTTP/FTP downloads and images generated with the pseudo
image kit, there are MD5 checksums available on the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cd-images/">master site</a>. Look
for the <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> files in the appropriate directories. An
<tt>md5sum</tt> program for Windows systems is included in the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">pseudo
image kit</a>; sources are also
<a href="ftp://ftp.funet.fi/pub/crypt/hash/mds/md5/">available</a>.

<p>If you want to check many CD image files or burned CDs easily
on Unix/Linux systems, the
<a href="ftp://fly.cnuce.cnr.it/pub/software/unix/checkiso">checkiso</a>
script can be a great help.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="record-windows">How do I record a CD-R under
Windows?</toc-add-entry>

<p>This might be a little problem, as many Windows programs use
their own formats for CD images. To burn the <tt>.iso</tt> images
you will most likely have to use a "special" menu. Look for
options like "ISO9660 file", "Raw ISO image" or "2048
bytes/sector". (Note: other bytes/sector values are fatal!) Some
programs do not offer these choices; use another burning program
instead (ask a friend or collegue). Here is some information about
how to record CD images with specific products:</p>

<p>The <strong>Toast</strong> program for Mac OS is reported to work fine with
<tt>.iso</tt> files. You can be extra-safe by giving it the
creator code <i>CDr3</i> (or possibly <i>CDr4</i>) and type code
<i>iImg</i> using e.g. FileTyper. Double-clicking on the file will
then open up Toast directly, without having to drag-and-drop or go
via the File-Open menu.</p>

<p>Another option is <strong>Disk Copy</strong> (included with Mac OS
X&nbsp;10.1 and higher): After opening the Disk Copy application (in

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="whatlabel">How should I label the
CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There is no obligatory way of labeling. However, we suggest you
use the following scheme to ensure interchangeability:</p>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/{Linux|Hurd}
      &lt;version&gt;[&lt;revision&gt;]<br>Official
      {&lt;architecture&gt; Binary|Source}-&lt;number&gt;</td>
</tr></table>

<p>For example:</p>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux 2.2<br>Official i386
      Binary-1</td>
</tr></table>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 rev4<br>Official
      alpha Binary-2</td>
</tr></table>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 rev4<br>Official
      Source-1</td>
</tr></table>

<p>In case you wish to distinguish between the "Non-US" and
"non-Non-US" versions of the first binary/source CD, you can label
the former as <i>Official Source-1 Non-US</i>. However, this is
not required.</p>

<p>If you have enough space, you can also add the codename to the
first line, as in: <i>Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 "Potato"</i>.</p>

<p>Note that you are allowed to use the <i>Official</i>
designation <strong>only</strong> on CDs the image of which has a
checksum that matches the one published on the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cd-images/">master site</a>. Any
CD that has no matching checksum (e.g. your own creations) must be
clearly labelled as <i>Unofficial</i>, for example:</p>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 rev4<br>Unofficial
      Non-free/Non-US</td>

<toc-add-entry name="lan-install">I want to install Debian on many
interconnected computers - how do I set up a local .deb
cache?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you want to install Debian on a large number of machines and
then keep all these installations up-to-date (e.g. security
updates), installing from CD ROM is not ideal, but then neither is
installing via the Internet, because the packages will have to be
downloaded again for each machine. In this case, you should set up
a local cache, the three options being:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Make CD contents available via FTP:</em> Download the
  CDs, then make their contents available to your LAN on a local
  FTP mirror. The individual machines can use this mirror as if it
  were a regular Debian FTP server.</li>

  <li><em>Instruct your HTTP proxy to cache .deb files:</em>
  Configure the proxy to keep .deb files for a long time, then set
  <tt>http_proxy</tt> in your environment on each machine to point
  at the cache, and use apt's HTTP acquisition method.<br>
  This gives you most of the benefits of running a mirror, with
  none of the admin hassle. Since you can set limits on the
  proxy's disk usage, it works even for sites with limited disk
  space, and it has the advantage over mirroring that you only
  download those packages you install, which saves bandwidth.
  Squid can be told to keep the files by adding a line to
  /etc/squid.conf:<br><tt>refresh_pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debian.org/.*.deb$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129600&nbsp;100%&nbsp;129600</tt></li>

  <li><em>Set up a private Debian packages mirror:</em> Beware
  that the Debian archive has grown to a tremendous size! Refer to
  the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">mirroring page</a> for details.</li>

</ul>

<p>Installing on a large number of machines can be tricky.
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">Fully automatic
installation</a> (FAI), which is also available as a Debian
package, may help you with this task.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="diy">I have a local Debian mirror and want to
create my own CDs. How do I do this?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Apart from a <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">local Debian mirror</a>,
you also need plenty of disc space. The CD creation scripts are packaged in
the <em>debian-cd</em> package. However, it is usually a better idea to use
the latest code from CVS. (Still, you should have a look at the package's
dependencies to ensure you have all the necessary tools.)</p>

<p>To get the latest CVS version, make sure you have CVS
installed. From an empty directory give the following commands:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot<br>
$ cvs login<br>
</tt>
<i>[leave password empty - press Enter]</i><br>
<tt>
$ cvs checkout -AP debian-cd<br>
$ cvs logout</tt>

<p>Should you try to use the scripts, check the

archive</a> for solutions to the problems that will inevitably
show up. :-)</p>
