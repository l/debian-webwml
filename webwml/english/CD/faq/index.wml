<toc-add-entry name="what-is">What is a "CD image" anyway?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A CD image is the exact representation of the data on a CD in a
normal computer file, that can e.g. be transmitted over the
Internet. CD burning programs can use the image files to make real
CDs.</p>

<p>If you cannot find an answer to your question here, you can ask for
help on one of the Debian mailing lists.
In all cases, you should <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">search
the mailing list archives</a> before sending mail to the lists.
You can <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">subscribe</a>
to and <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>
from the lists. However, you do not need to be subscribed in order
to send mail to the lists - if you are not subscribed, ask for
replies to be CC'd to you.</p>

<p>Mailing lists relevant to problems with CD installation:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd</a>:
  Discussion about the CD image creation process, available CD
  mirrors, problems when booting from CD, announcements of new
  official images.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a>: A
  bit of a misnomer, this list actually covers the installation
  process; any problems encountered after successfully booting

<toc-add-entry name="debian31r0">I have downloaded/bought the 3.1 rev0
(or rev0a) images, but the disc's README says that "this is an
unofficial CD of the current development version"!</toc-add-entry>

<p>The README is wrong, in fact the images <em>are</em> the official
3.1 rev0a images. Due to a mistake, the README information for an
unofficial rather than an official image was used - sorry about the
confusion! As this is considered to be a minor issue, it will only be
fixed for the rev1 images, there will not be a 3.1 rev0b release.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="why-jigdo">Why should I use this "jigdo" program?
I prefer a simple HTTP or FTP download!</toc-add-entry>

<p>Today, there are nearly <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">300 Debian
mirrors</a> (which contain the complete Debian distribution as .deb files),
but <a href="../http-ftp/">far fewer</a> machines serving Debian CD images.
As a result, the CD image servers are constantly overloaded.</p>

<p>Additionally, nobody is very enthusiastic about setting up more
CD servers because of the tremendous amounts of wasted bandwidth
(some people keep <em>restarting</em> failed downloads instead of
<em>resuming</em> from the point where the connection was closed)
and because a regular mirror is more attractive (it allows
continuous upgrades of Debian, or using the "testing"/"unstable"
distribution instead of the "stable" one).</p>

<p>jigdo tries to make
the most out of this situation, by downloading the data for the CD
images from one of the 300 mirrors. However, these mirrors only
hold individual .deb files, not the CD image, so some additional
manipulation of the data is necessary to produce one big CD image
file from the many small .deb files.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid to <a href="../jigdo-cd/">try out jigdo</a>!
The complex process of generating the CD image is completely
hidden from you - instead, you benefit from the fact that one of
the 300 Debian mirrors is bound to be nearer and faster than any
of the CD servers.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="which-cd">Which of the numerous images
should I download? Do I need all of them?</toc-add-entry>

<p>No. First, of course you only need to download either CD
<em>or</em> DVD images - the two types of images contain the same
packages.</p>

<p>Also, you only need the CD/DVD images for your computer's
architecture. The architecture is the type of hardware your
computer uses. By far the most popular one is the Intel/AMD
architecture, so most people will only want to get the images for
"i386".</p>

<p>Furthermore, in most cases it is not necessary to download all
of the images for your architecture. The packages are
sorted by popularity: The first CD/DVD contains the installation system and
the most popular packages. the second one contains slightly less popular
ones, the third one even less popular ones, etc. You will probably
only need the first DVD (or the first two CDs) unless you have very
special requirements. (And in
case you happen to need a package later on which is not on one of
the CDs/DVDs you downloaded, you can always install that package
directly from the Internet.)</p>

<p>Please also read the next paragraphs to determine whether you
want/need to download network install CDs, update CDs or source
CDs.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="netinst">What is a "netinst" or "network install"
CD?</toc-add-entry>

<p>To quote the <a href="../netinst/">network install page</a>: A
"network install" or "netinst" CD is a single CD which enables you to
install the entire operating system. This single CD contains just the
minimal amount of software to start the installation and fetch the
remaining packages over the Internet.</p>

<p>If you only want to install Debian on a single machine which has a
cheap Internet connection, the network install may be the fastest and
easiest option for you: You only download the packages that you
selected for installation on your machine, which saves both time and
bandwidth.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="update-cd">What are the "update"
CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Update CDs are CDs which contain all the packages that changed
between the rev0 and a later revN release of the current stable
distribution. For example, if you already have the full set of 3.0rev0
CDs, you can use the "update-3.0rev2" CD to turn this 3.0rev0 set into
a 3.0rev2 set.</p>

<p>This type of CD is intended for vendors having large amounts of
pressed rev0 CDs (which makes them cheaper than individually burned
CDs). If you order CDs from such a vendor, it is possible that you
receive CDs for a slightly older revision, plus an update CD for the
latest revision. This is a perfectly acceptable way of distributing
Debian on CD.</p>

<p>Of course, this type of CD can also be useful to you as an end user;
instead of creating the full set of CDs for each new revision of a
release, you only need to download and burn one or two update CDs for
your architecture.</p>

<p>You only need to download <strong>either</strong> the update CD
<strong>or</strong> the normal CDs, not both!</p>

<p>Now, what if for some reason you do not want to download the update
CD even though you already have the full set of CDs for the previous
revision? In this case, you should consider using <a
href="../jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>'s "update" feature: jigdo can read the
contents of the old CDs, download only those files that have changed
for the new CDs, and create the full set of new CDs. Still, it will
have done this by downloading only about the same amount of data as
for an update CD.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="source-cd">What are the "source"
CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are two types of images, the "binary" CDs that contain
precompiled, ready-to-run programs, and the "source" CDs that
contain the source code for the programs. The vast majority of
people do not need the source CDs; you should not download them
unless you really have a good reason for it.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="nonfree">Where is the CD image with
non-free?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian has a quite strict view with regard to the licenses of
software: Only software that is Free in the sense of the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> is allowed into the actual distribution. All the other,
"non-free" software (for example, software for which source code is not
available) is not supported officially.</p>

<p>The official CDs may freely be used, copied and sold by anyone anywhere
in the world. Packages of the "non-free" category have restrictions that
conflict with this, so these packages are not placed on the official
CDs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, someone is kind enough to create unofficial non-free
CDs. If you cannot find any links on this website, you can try
<a href="#mailing-list">asking on the debian-cd mailing list</a>.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="dvd">Are DVD images of Debian
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Yes - Debian offers DVD images for the current stable
release. Additionally, as far as we know, Debian is the only Linux
distribution to
offer weekly full-size DVD images for download! Because of their size, these
images are <a href="../jigdo-cd/">distributed with
jigdo</a>.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="official">What's the difference between official
and unofficial images?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Official images are built by a member of the Debian CD team and
have undergone some testing to ensure they work. Once they have been
released, the images never change - if they turn out to be broken, a
new set with a different version number is released.</p>

<p>Unofficial images can be built by anyone - CD team members, other
Debian developers or even advanced Debian users. Typically, they are
more up-to-date, but have received less testing. Some have new
features (e.g. installation support for new hardware), special sizes
(DVD-sized, business card sized or similar), or contain additional
software packages which are not part of the Debian archive.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="live-cd">Is a Debian "live CD"
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A so-called "live CD" is a CD which contains a complete system
pre-installed on the CD. You do not need to install anything on the
harddisc, instead you boot from CD and are able to start working on
the machine right away. All programs run directly from CD.</p>

<p>There are <em>no</em> official Debian live CDs available. However,
we would like to recommend <a
href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/">Knoppix</a>, which is based on
Debian - a very useful, full-featured live CD!</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="bootable">The first CD fails to boot! / From
which CD should I boot?</toc-add-entry>

<p><em>This information is outdated, it refers to Debian 3.0
("woody").</em></p>

<p>The following only applies to the i386 architecture.
For other architectures, only the first CD is bootable (except for
<a href="$(HOME)/ports/arm/">arm</a>, where
<em>none</em> is).</p>

<p>Some hardware configurations of IBM compatible PCs require
Linux kernels with special options enabled or patches applied. For
this reason, the CDs contain several different kernels:</p>

<ul>
  <li>binary-1: <strong>multiboot</strong>. This CD offers you a
  choice between all available kernels, so unless you happen to have
  one of the very few machines on which the multiboot feature does not
  work (typically very old systems or SCSI systems), you should boot
  from this CD.</li>

  <li>binary-2: <strong>vanilla</strong>. A 2.2 kernel with many
  drivers for older hardware (such as ISA-based systems) and USB
  support.</li>

  <li>binary-3: <strong>compact</strong>. A 2.2 kernel with PCI SCSI
  and IDE drivers.</li>

  <li>binary-4: <strong>idepci</strong>. A one-size-fits-all 2.2
  kernel which should work on most machines. This is also booted by
  default if you just press Return at the prompt of the multiboot
  (binary-1) CD.</li>

  <li>binary-5: <strong>bf2.4</strong>. A 2.4 kernel with ext3 and
  ReiserFS support. You should choose this kernel if your hardware is
  recent, e.g. you are using a USB keyboard.</li>
</ul>

<p>The kernels correspond to the different disk images on the FTP server
for <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/">\
stable</a> and
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/testing/main/disks-i386/">\
testing</a>. In case your system cannot boot from CD at all, it is
also possible to <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/floppyinst">write the kernel
to floppy disc</a> and boot from there.</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="arch">Where are the images for AMD64, Hurd or
other architectures?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Depending on the state of support for a certain architecture,
CD/DVD images are available from different places:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If the architecture you are looking for is officially
  supported by the current <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable
  release</a>, see the <a href="../">"Debian on CD"</a> page for
  the available download options.</li>

  <li>If a Debian port to a new architecture exists, but has not
  yet been released officially, CD images may or may not be
  available. Again, see the <a href="../">"Debian on CD"</a> page - in
  contrast to stable images, only one download option may be
  supported, so have a look at both the "jigdo" and "HTTP/FTP"
  sections.</li>

  <li>For the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/amd64/">Debian port to the amd64
  architecture</a>, netinst and businesscard ISOs as well as full CD
  and DVD sets of the unofficial Sarge release are available <a
  href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/unofficial/sarge-amd64/">on
  cdimage.debian.org</a>.

  <li>For the Debian port to the GNU/Hurd, see the
  <a href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/hurd-cd">page about unofficial Hurd CDs</a>.

  <li>Otherwise, check the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">Debian port pages</a>
  for the architecture you are interested in.</li>

</ul>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="outdated">The software on the official CDs is
outdated - why don't you release a new version?</toc-add-entry>

<p>We only make official releases of the "stable" distribution
when we think they truly deserve that name. Unfortunately, this
means that stable releases only happen about every 1.5
years...</p>

<p>If you require more recent versions of some of the software in
Debian, you can install "stable" and then upgrade (via the net)
those parts you want to the versions from "testing" - it is
possible to mix software from the different releases.</p>

<p>Alternatively, try out the CD images of "testing"
that are generated automatically every week. However, note that
there is <em>no support for security problems</em> for "testing" -
in extreme cases, several weeks can go by before security holes
are fixed. <em>Do not use "testing" for servers!</em></p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="newest">How do I know if I am downloading the
newest CD images?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The note at the bottom of the <a href="../">"Debian on CD"</a> page
always shows the version number of the latest
release.</p>

<p>As for mirror sites that offer direct HTTP/FTP downloads, most
use the "standard" scheme
<tt>/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;architecture&gt;/&lt;imagename&gt;.iso</tt>,
for example <tt>/3.0_r1/i386/binary-i386-1.iso</tt> or
<tt>/3.0_r1/source/source-1.iso</tt>.
</p>

<gototop>
# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="verify">How can I verify that the downloaded
CD images are correct?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you use <a href="../jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>, the image checksum is
automatically verified after the image has been generated. For HTTP or
FTP downloads, use the <tt>md5sum</tt> utility to calculate the
checksums of the files you downloaded, then compare them to the
checksums in the <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> files which are distributed alongside
the <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/jigdo/">jigdo
files of official releases</a>. An <tt>md5sum</tt> program for Windows
systems can be downloaded <a
href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/md5sum-w32.zip">from our ftp
server</a>; <a
href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/tools/src/md5sum-w32_1.1.tar.gz">the
source code</a> is also available.</p>

<p>To ensure that the images were not only downloaded correctly, but
are indeed official images, you also have to verify the GnuPG
signature on the <tt>MD5SUMS</tt> files using the <a
href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/">Debian GPG keyring</a>. CD
vendors are encouraged to do this.</p>

<p>If you want to check many CD image files or burned CDs easily
on Unix/Linux systems, the
<a href="http://fly.cnuce.cnr.it/software/#checkiso">checkiso</a>

<toc-add-entry name="record-windows">How do I record a CD-R under
Windows?</toc-add-entry>

<p>This might be a little problem, as many Windows programs use
their own formats for CD images. To burn the <tt>.iso</tt> images
you will most likely have to use a "special" menu. Look for
options like "ISO9660 file", "Raw ISO image" or "2048
bytes/sector". (Note: other bytes/sector values are fatal!) Some
programs do not offer these choices; use another burning program
instead (ask a friend or colleague). Here is some information about
how to record CD images with specific products:</p>

<p>If you have enough space, you can also add the codename to the
first line, as in: <i>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 "Sarge"</i>.</p>

<p>Note that you are allowed to use the <i>Official</i>
designation <strong>only</strong> on CDs the image of which has a
checksum that matches the one from the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/jigdo/">jigdo
files of official releases</a>.
Any CD that has no matching checksum (e.g. your own creations) must be
clearly labelled as <i>Unofficial</i>, for example:</p>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 rev1<br>Unofficial
      Non-free</td>
</tr></table>

<p>In the case of official weekly snapshots, version numbers like "3.1
rev1" should not be used to avoid confusion with released Debian
versions. Instead, label the image with a codename like "etch" or a
distribution name like "testing". Also add "Snapshot" and the date of
the snapshot:</p>

<table width="80%" bgcolor="#b3b3b3" align="center"><tr>
      <td align="center">Debian GNU/Linux "etch"<br>
      Official Snapshot alpha Binary-2<br>

<p>There is no official layout for the cover, back and label of a

<toc-add-entry name="lan-install">What is the best way of installing
Debian on many interconnected computers?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you want to install Debian on a large number of machines and
then keep all these installations up-to-date (e.g. security
updates), installing from CD ROM is not ideal, but then neither is
installing via the Internet, because the packages will have to be
downloaded again for each machine. In this case, you should set up
a local cache, the three options being:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Make CD contents available via HTTP or FTP:</em> Download the
  CDs, then make their contents available to your LAN on a local
  mirror. The individual machines can use this mirror as if it
  were a regular Debian server. For example, if the contents of a CD
  are available under the URL <tt>http://10.0.0.1/cd1/</tt>, machines
  in the local network can use the packages from the CD with the
  following line in their <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:<br>
  <tt>deb http://10.0.0.1/cd1/ stable main contrib</tt><br>
  A different URL and a separate entry in <tt>sources.list</tt> is
  necessary for each CD.</li>

  <li><em>Instruct your HTTP proxy to cache .deb files:</em>
  Configure the proxy to keep .deb files for a long time, then set
  <tt>http_proxy</tt> in your environment on each machine to point
  at the cache, and use apt's HTTP acquisition method.<br>
  This gives you most of the benefits of running a mirror, with
  none of the admin hassle. Since you can set limits on the
  proxy's disk usage, it works even for sites with limited disk
  space, and it has the advantage over mirroring that you only
  download those packages you install, which saves bandwidth.
  Squid can be told to keep the files by adding a line to
  <tt>/etc/squid.conf</tt>:<br><tt>refresh_pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debian.org/.*.deb$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129600&nbsp;100%&nbsp;129600</tt></li>

  <li><em>Set up a private Debian packages mirror:</em> Beware
  that the Debian archive has grown to a tremendous size! Refer to
  the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">mirroring page</a> for details.</li>

</ul>

<p>Installing on a large number of machines can be tricky.
<a href="http://www.informatik.uni-koeln.de/fai/">Fully automatic
installation</a> (FAI), which is also available as a Debian
package, may help you with this task.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="diy">I have a local Debian mirror and want to
create my own CDs. How do I do this?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Apart from a <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">local Debian mirror</a>,
you also need plenty of disc space. The CD creation scripts are packaged in
the <em>debian-cd</em> package. However, it is usually a better idea to use
the latest code from CVS. (Still, you should have a look at the package's
dependencies to ensure you have all the necessary tools.)</p>

<p>To get the latest CVS version, make sure you have CVS
installed. From an empty directory give the following commands:</p>

<blockquote>
<tt>
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot<br>
$ cvs login<br>
</tt>
<i>[leave password empty - press Enter]</i><br>
<tt>
$ cvs checkout -AP debian-cd<br>
$ cvs logout</tt>
</blockquote>

<p>Should you try to use the scripts, check the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd mailing list
archive</a> for solutions to the problems that will inevitably
show up. :-)</p>
