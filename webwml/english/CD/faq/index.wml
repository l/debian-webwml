<h1><a name="top">Frequently Asked Questions</a></h1>

<toc-display/>



<toc-add-entry name="what-is">What is a <q>CD image</q> anyway?</toc-add-entry>

<p>A CD image is the exact representation of the data on a CD in a
normal computer file, that can e.g. be transmitted over the
Internet. CD burning programs can use the image files to make real
CDs.</p>

<p>For a correctly recorded CD, the <tt>.iso</tt> file must not appear
on the CD when you access it! Instead, you should see a number of
files and directories - in the case of a Debian CD, this includes a
<q>dists</q> directory and a <q>README.html</q> file.</p>

<p>The <tt>.iso</tt> format is roughly comparable to a <tt>.zip</tt>
file: It contains other files and directories, and only these will
appear on the final CD. Some archive programs allow you to <q>unpack</q>
<tt>.iso</tt> files. Do not use this feature to create a CD from the
unpacked files! The resulting CD will fail to boot because the
<tt>.iso</tt> format includes special information related to booting
from the CD, which is lost when you unpack the file. See below on how
to correctly record a CD image under <a href="#record-unix">Linux</a>,
<a href="#record-windows">Windows</a> or <a
href="#record-mac">MacOS</a>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="mailing-list">My question is not answered by this
FAQ!</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you cannot find an answer to your question here, you can ask for
help on one of the Debian mailing lists.
In all cases, you should <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">search
the mailing list archives</a> before sending mail to the lists.
You can <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">subscribe</a>
to and <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a>
from the lists. However, you do not need to be subscribed in order
to send mail to the lists - if you are not subscribed, ask for
replies to be CC'd to you.</p>

<p>Mailing lists relevant to problems with CD installation:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd</a>:
  Discussion about the CD image creation process, available CD
  mirrors, problems when booting from CD, announcements of new
  official images.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/">debian-boot</a>: A
  bit of a misnomer, this list actually covers the installation
  process; any problems encountered after successfully booting
  from CD may be more appropriate here than in debian-cd.</li>

  <li><a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-live/">debian-live</a>:
  A list for the Debian Live project, focused on development of the software

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="why-jigdo">Why should I use this <q>jigdo</q> program?
I prefer a simple HTTP or FTP download!</toc-add-entry>

<p>Today, there are nearly <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">300 Debian
mirrors</a> (which contain the complete Debian distribution as .deb files),
but <a href="../http-ftp/">far fewer</a> machines serving Debian CD images.
As a result, the CD image servers are constantly overloaded.</p>

<p>Additionally, nobody is very enthusiastic about setting up more
CD servers because of the tremendous amounts of wasted bandwidth
(some people keep <em>restarting</em> failed downloads instead of
<em>resuming</em> from the point where the connection was closed)
and because a regular mirror is more attractive (it allows
continuous upgrades of Debian, or using the <q>testing</q>/<q>unstable</q>
distribution instead of the <q>stable</q> one).</p>

<p>jigdo tries to make
the most out of this situation, by downloading the data for the CD
images from one of the 300 mirrors. However, these mirrors only
hold individual .deb files, not the CD image, so some additional
manipulation of the data is necessary to produce one big CD image
file from the many small .deb files.</p>

<p>Do not be afraid to <a href="../jigdo-cd/">try out jigdo</a>!
The complex process of generating the CD image is completely
hidden from you - instead, you benefit from the fact that one of
the 300 Debian mirrors is bound to be nearer and faster than any
of the CD servers.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="which-cd">Which of the numerous images
should I download? Do I need all of them?</toc-add-entry>

<p>No. First, of course you only need to download either CD
<em>or</em> DVD images - the two types of images contain the same
packages.</p>

<p>Also, you only need the CD/DVD images for your computer's
architecture. The architecture is the type of hardware your
computer uses. By far the most popular one is the Intel/AMD
architecture, so most people will only want to get the images for
<q>i386</q>. If your PC has a 64-bit AMD or Intel processor, you will most
likely need the <q><a href="../../ports/amd64/">amd64</a></q> images
(though <q>i386</q> is also fine), the <q><a
href="../../ports/ia64/">ia64</a></q> images will <em>not</em> work.</p>

<p>Furthermore, in most cases it is not necessary to download all
of the images for your architecture. The packages are
sorted by popularity: The first CD/DVD contains the installation system and
the most popular packages. The second one contains slightly less popular
ones, the third one even less popular ones, etc. You will probably
only need the first DVD (or the first two CDs) unless you have very
special requirements. (And in
case you happen to need a package later on which is not on one of
the CDs/DVDs you downloaded, you can always install that package
directly from the Internet.)</p>

<p>Please also read the next paragraphs to determine whether you
want/need to download network install CDs, update CDs or source
CDs.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="netinst">What is a <q>netinst</q> or <q>network install</q>
CD?</toc-add-entry>

<p>To quote the <a href="../netinst/">network install page</a>: A
<q>network install</q> or <q>netinst</q> CD is a single CD which enables you to
install the entire operating system. This single CD contains just the
minimal amount of software to start the installation and fetch the
remaining packages over the Internet.</p>

<p>If you only want to install Debian on a single machine which has a
cheap Internet connection, the network install may be the fastest and
easiest option for you: You only download the packages that you
selected for installation on your machine, which saves both time and
bandwidth.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="update-cd">What are the <q>update</q>
CDs/DVDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Update CDs/DVDs are CDs/DVDs which contain all the packages that changed
between the zero micro version number (e.g. 5.0.<strong>0</strong>, 6.0.<strong>0</strong>,
etc.) and a later point release of the current stable distribution. For example, if you already
have the full set of <q>debian-6.0.0</q> CDs/DVDs, you can use the <q>debian-update-6.0.1</q> CD to turn
this <q>debian-6.0.0</q> set into a <q>debian-6.0.1</q> set.</p>

<p>This type of CD/DVD is intended for vendors having large amounts of
pressed zero micro version number CDs/DVDs (which makes them cheaper than individually burned
CDs/DVDs). If you order CDs/DVDs from such a vendor, it is possible that you
receive CDs/DVDs for a slightly older point release, plus an update CD/DVD for the
latest revision. This is a perfectly acceptable way of distributing
Debian on CD/DVD.</p>

<p>Of course, this type of CD/DVD can also be useful to you as an end user;
instead of creating the full set of CDs/DVDs for each new revision of a
release, you only need to download and burn update CDs/DVDs for
your architecture.</p>

<p>Note that update CDs/DVDs are not meant to boot, they just contain the
packages needed to upgrade an existing installation. If you don't have
that existing installation, then you'll need to use the normal
installation CDs/DVDs. After the new system is booted, the updated CD/DVD can be added with
<code>apt-cdrom add</code>.</p>

<p>Now, what if for some reason you do not want to download the update
CD/DVD even though you already have the full set of CDs/DVDs for the previous
revision? In this case, you should consider using <a
href="../jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>'s <q>update</q> feature: jigdo can read the
contents of the old CDs/DVDs, download only those files that have changed
for the new CDs/DVDs, and create the full set of new CDs/DVDs. Still, it will
have done this by downloading only about the same amount of data as
for an update CD/DVD.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="source-cd">What are the <q>source</q>
CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are two types of images, the <q>binary</q> CDs that contain
precompiled, ready-to-run programs, and the <q>source</q> CDs that
contain the source code for the programs. The vast majority of
people do not need the source CDs; you should not download them
unless you really have a good reason for it.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="nonfree">Where is the CD image with
non-free?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Debian has a quite strict view with regard to the licenses of
software: Only software that is Free in the sense of the
<a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a> is allowed into the actual distribution. All the other,
<q>non-free</q> software (for example, software for which source code is not
available) is not supported officially.</p>

<p>The official CDs may freely be used, copied and sold by anyone anywhere
in the world. Packages of the <q>non-free</q> category have restrictions that
conflict with this, so these packages are not placed on the official
CDs.</p>

<p>Sometimes, someone is kind enough to create unofficial non-free
CDs. If you cannot find any links on this website, you can try
<a href="#mailing-list">asking on the debian-cd mailing list</a>.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="dvd">Are DVD images of Debian
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Yes - Debian offers DVD images for the current stable
release. Additionally, as far as we know, Debian is the only Linux
distribution to
offer weekly full-size DVD images for download! Because of their size, these
images are <a href="../jigdo-cd/">distributed with
jigdo</a>.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="official">What's the difference between official
and unofficial images?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Official images are built by a member of the Debian CD team and
have undergone some testing to ensure they work. Once they have been
released, the images never change - if they turn out to be broken, a
new set with a different version number is released.</p>

<p>Unofficial images can be built by anyone - CD team members, other
Debian developers or even advanced Debian users. Typically, they are
more up-to-date, but have received less testing. Some have new
features (e.g. installation support for new hardware), or contain
additional software packages which are not part of the Debian archive.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="live-cd">Is a Debian <q>live CD</q>
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p> Yes. A so-called <q>live CD</q>, or more precisely, a <q>live system</q>,
is a complete system prepared for a CD, DVD, USB key or other medium. You do not
need to install anything on the hard drive.  Instead you boot from the CD or
other medium and are able to start working on the machine right away. All
programs run directly from the medium.</p>

<p>The <a href="$(HOME)/devel/debian-live/">Debian Live Project</a> produces
<a href="../live/">live image files</a> for a variety of system types and
media.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="bootable">The CD/DVD fails to boot! / From
which CD should I boot?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Only the first CD/DVD in a set is bootable.</p>

<p>If your Debian CD fails to boot, first ensure that you have
correctly written it to the CD-R(W) medium - please <a
href="#what-is">see the explanation above</a>. Additionally, please
check whether your BIOS is set up to boot from the CD/DVD drive.</p>

<p>If your system cannot boot from CD at all, it is
also possible to <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/floppyinst">boot from a floppy
disc</a>.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="arch">Where are the images for M68K, Hurd or
other architectures?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Depending on the state of support for a certain architecture,
CD/DVD images are available from different places:</p>

<ul>

  <li>If the architecture you are looking for is officially
  supported by the current <a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/">stable
  release</a>, see the <a href="../"><q>Debian on CD</q></a> page for
  the available download options.</li>

  <li>If a Debian port for an architecture exists, but has not
  yet been released officially, CD images may or may not be
  available. Again, see the <a href="../"><q>Debian on CD</q></a> page - in
  contrast to stable images, only one download option may be
  supported, so have a look at both the <q>jigdo</q> and <q>HTTP/FTP</q>
  sections.</li>

  <li>For the Debian port to the GNU/Hurd, see the
  <a href="$(HOME)/ports/hurd/hurd-cd">page about unofficial Hurd CDs</a>.

  <li>Otherwise, check the <a href="$(HOME)/ports/">Debian port pages</a>
  for the architecture you are interested in.</li>

</ul>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="unstable-images">Are images for the <q>unstable</q>
distribution available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There are no <q>unstable</q> full CD or DVD images. Due to the fact that
the packages in <q>unstable</q> change so quickly, it is more appropriate
for people to download and install <q>unstable</q> using a normal Debian
FTP mirror.</p>

<p>If you are aware of the <a href="../../releases/unstable/">risks of
running unstable</a>, but still want to install it, you have two
choices:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Install <q>testing</q> using a <a href="../netinst/">netinst
  image</a>, then upgrade to <q>unstable</q> by changing the entries in
  your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>. To avoid unnecessary downloads
  and package upgrades, it is advisable to install a minimal
  <q>testing</q> system first and only to install most of the software
  (e.g. desktop environment) after the switch to <q>unstable</q>.</li>

  <li>Use the <a href="../netinst/">business card image</a>. Boot from
  it in expert mode or with <tt>priority=medium</tt>. You will then be
  able to select the distribution (stable/testing/unstable) during
  mirror selection.</li>

</ul>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="search-for-package">Which CD/DVD image contains
package XYZ?</toc-add-entry>

<p>To find out which image contains a certain file, use the <a
href="http://cdimage-search.debian.org">cdimage search tool</a>.
It has knowledge of just about all the Debian CDs and DVDs produced
by Debian since the Woody release, covering all the official releases
(both older archived releases and the current stable release) and the
current sets of daily and weekly testing builds.
</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="list-image-contents">Can I have a list of all the
packages contained in an image?</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Yes.
Look on <a
href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/">cdimage.debian.org</a> for
the corresponding <tt>.list.gz</tt> file - it will list all the
packages and source files included in the image.
For Debian Live images, you can find in the same directory as the
image files some similarly named files suffixed with <tt>.packages</tt>.
Download these and then search them for the desired package name.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="outdated">The software on the official CDs is
outdated - why don't you release a new version?</toc-add-entry>

<p>We only make official releases of the <q>stable</q> distribution
when we think they truly deserve that name. Unfortunately, this
means that stable releases only happen about every 1.5
years...</p>

<p>If you require more recent versions of some of the software in
Debian, you can install <q>stable</q> and then upgrade (via the net)
those parts you want to the versions from <q>testing</q> - it is
possible to mix software from the different releases.</p>

<p>Alternatively, try out the CD images of <q>testing</q> that are
generated automatically every week. In this case, be sure to set up
your computer correctly to receive <a
href="http://secure-testing-master.debian.net/"><q>testing</q> security
updates</a>, especially if you run <q>testing</q> on a server. More
information about <a href="../../security/faq#testing"><q>testing</q>
security support</a> is available from the security FAQ.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="newest">How do I know if I am downloading the
newest CD images?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The note at the bottom of the <a href="../"><q>Debian on CD</q></a> page
always shows the version number of the latest
release.</p>

<p>As for mirror sites that offer direct HTTP/FTP downloads, most
use the <q>standard</q> scheme
<tt>/&lt;version&gt;/&lt;architecture&gt;/&lt;imagename&gt;.iso</tt>,
for example <tt>/3.0_r1/i386/binary-i386-1.iso</tt> or
<tt>/3.0_r1/source/source-1.iso</tt>.
</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="verify">How can I verify that the downloaded
CD images are correct?</toc-add-entry>

<p>
Detailed information is available on the <a
href="../verify">authenticity verification page</a>.
</p>

<p>An <tt>md5sum</tt> program for Windows systems is available
as part of the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com">Cygwin suite</a>
(install the <q>coreutils</q> package), or you may be able to find standalone
binaries compiled for <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to check many CD image files or burned CDs easily
on Unix/Linux systems, the
<a href="http://fly.cnuce.cnr.it/software/#checkiso">checkiso</a>
#<a href="ftp://fly.cnuce.cnr.it/pub/software/unix/checkiso">checkiso</a>
script can be a great help.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="small-dvd">Why is my downloaded DVD image smaller
than 1&nbsp;GB when it should be larger than
4&nbsp;GB?</toc-add-entry>

<p><a id="wget-dvd"></a>Most likely, the tool you use for downloading
the image does not have large file support, i.e. it has problems
downloading files larger than 4&nbsp;GBytes. The usual symptom for
this problem is that when you download the file, the file size
reported by your tool (and the amount of data that it downloads) is
too small by exactly 4&nbsp;GB. For example, if the DVD image is
4.4&nbsp;GB large, your tool will report a size of 0.4&nbsp;GB.</p>

<p>Some versions of <tt>wget</tt> also suffer from this problem - either
upgrade to a version of <tt>wget</tt> which does not have this
restriction or use the <tt>curl</tt> command line download tool:
<q><tt>curl -C - </tt><i>[URL]</i></q></p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="record-unix">How do I record a CD-R under
Linux/Unix?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Use the
<a href="http://cdrecord.berlios.de/old/private/cdrecord.html">cdrecord</a>
program, with a command line like this (as root):
<br /><tt>nice&nbsp;--18&nbsp;cdrecord&nbsp;-eject&nbsp;-v&nbsp;speed=2&nbsp;dev=0,6,0&nbsp;-data&nbsp;-pad&nbsp;binary-i386-1.iso</tt></p>

<p>
Debian forked cdrecord in etch. Please try wodim on Debian based systems
instead of cdrecord. 
</p>

<p>For Linux, there are also the X programs

<toc-add-entry name="record-windows">How do I record a CD-R under
Windows?</toc-add-entry>

<p>This might be a little problem, as many Windows programs use
their own formats for CD images. To burn the <tt>.iso</tt> images
you will most likely have to use a <q>special</q> menu. Look for
options like <q>ISO9660 file</q>, <q>Raw ISO image</q> or <q>2048
bytes/sector</q>. (Note: other bytes/sector values are fatal!) Some
programs do not offer these choices; use another burning program
instead (ask a friend or colleague). Here is some information about
how to record CD images with specific products:</p>

<toc-add-entry name="record-mac">How do I record a CD-R under
Mac OS?</toc-add-entry>

<p>The <strong>Toast</strong> program for Mac OS is reported to work fine with
<tt>.iso</tt> files. You can be extra-safe by giving it the
creator code <i>CDr3</i> (or possibly <i>CDr4</i>) and type code
<i>iImg</i> using e.g. FileTyper. Double-clicking on the file will
then open up Toast directly, without having to drag-and-drop or go
via the File-Open menu.</p>

<p>Another option is <strong>Disk Copy</strong> (included with Mac OS
X&nbsp;10.1 and higher): After opening the Disk Copy application (in
the <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt> folder), select
<i>Burn&nbsp;Image...</i> in the <i>Image</i> menu and choose the CD
image to burn. Ensure that the settings are correct, then click on
<i>Burn</i>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the
<a href="http://www.fokus.gmd.de/research/cc/glone/employees/joerg.schilling/private/cdrecord.html">cdrecord</a>
program is available
<a href="ftp://ftp.fokus.gmd.de/pub/unix/cdrecord/alpha/macos-x/">for
Mac OS X</a> as well.

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="whatlabel">How should I label the
CDs?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There is no obligatory way of labeling. However, we suggest you
use the following scheme to ensure interchangeability:</p>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/{Linux|Hurd}
      &lt;version&gt;[&lt;revision&gt;]<br />Official
      {&lt;architecture&gt; Binary|Source}-&lt;number&gt;</p>
</div>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1<br />Official i386
      Binary-1</p>
</div>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 rev1<br />Official
      alpha Binary-2</p>
</div>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 rev1<br />Official
      Source-1</p>
</div>

<p>If you have enough space, you can also add the codename to the
first line, as in: <i>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 <q>Sarge</q></i>.</p>

<p>Note that you are allowed to use the <em>Official</em>
designation <strong>only</strong> on CDs the image of which has a
checksum that matches the one from the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/jigdo/">jigdo
files of official releases</a>.
Any CD that has no matching checksum (e.g. your own creations) must be
clearly labelled as <em>Unofficial</em>, for example:</p>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/Linux 3.1 rev1<br />Unofficial
      Non-free</p>
</div>

<p>In the case of official weekly snapshots, version numbers like <q>3.1
rev1</q> should not be used to avoid confusion with released Debian
versions. Instead, label the image with a codename like <q>etch</q> or a
distribution name like <q>testing</q>. Also add <q>Snapshot</q> and the date of
the snapshot:</p>

<div class="cdflash">
      <p>Debian GNU/Linux <q>etch</q><br />
      Official Snapshot alpha Binary-2<br />
      2005-06-17</p>
</div>

<toc-add-entry name="artwork">Is there any artwork for CDs and
covers?</toc-add-entry>

<p>There is no official layout for the cover, back and label of a
Debian CD, but a number of people have produced nice-looking
images. Please see the separate <a href="../artwork/">artwork
page</a>.

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="old">Are old CD/DVD images still
available?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Some older images are available from the <a
href="http://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/">archive
section on cdimage.debian.org</a>. For example, you might want to try
out older images if you need support for a certain (sub)architecture
which has been dropped for a newer release.</p>

<p>Note that when you install using an old CD/DVD, the contents of
<tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt> will reference the <em>current</em>
stable Debian release by default. This means that any upgrade over the
net will upgrade to the current stable release.  To avoid this, but
still receive security upgrades for an old release which is still
supported, you may want to change the contents of this file, replacing
<q>stable</q> with <q>oldstable</q>.</p>

<toc-add-entry name="lan-install">What is the best way of installing
Debian on many interconnected computers?</toc-add-entry>

<p>If you want to install Debian on a large number of machines and
then keep all these installations up-to-date (e.g. security
updates), installing from CD ROM is not ideal, but then neither is
installing via the Internet, because the packages will have to be
downloaded again for each machine. In this case, you should set up
a local cache, the three options being:</p>

<ul>

  <li><em>Make CD contents available via HTTP or FTP:</em> Download the
  CDs, then make their contents available to your LAN on a local
  mirror. The individual machines can use this mirror as if it
  were a regular Debian server. For example, if the contents of a CD
  are available under the URL <tt>http://10.0.0.1/cd1/</tt>, machines
  in the local network can use the packages from the CD with the
  following line in their <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>:<br />
  <tt>deb http://10.0.0.1/cd1/ stable main contrib</tt><br />
  A different URL and a separate entry in <tt>sources.list</tt> is
  necessary for each CD.</li>

  <li><em>Instruct your HTTP proxy to cache .deb files:</em>
  Configure the proxy to keep .deb files for a long time, then set
  <tt>http_proxy</tt> in your environment on each machine to point
  at the cache, and use apt's HTTP acquisition method.<br />
  This gives you most of the benefits of running a mirror, with
  none of the admin hassle. Since you can set limits on the
  proxy's disk usage, it works even for sites with limited disk
  space, and it has the advantage over mirroring that you only
  download those packages you install, which saves bandwidth.
  Squid can be told to keep the files by adding a line to
  <tt>/etc/squid/squid.conf</tt>:<br /><tt>refresh_pattern&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;debian.org/.*.deb$&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;129600&nbsp;100%&nbsp;129600</tt></li>

  <li><em>Set up a private Debian packages mirror:</em> Beware
  that the Debian archive has grown to a tremendous size! Refer to
  the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">mirroring page</a> for details.</li>

</ul>

<p>Installing on a large number of machines can be tricky.
<a href="http://fai-project.org/">Fully automatic
installation</a> (FAI), which is also available as a Debian
package, may help you with this task.</p>

# ============================================================

<toc-add-entry name="diy">I have a local Debian mirror and want to
create my own CDs. How do I do this?</toc-add-entry>

<p>Apart from a <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">local Debian mirror</a>,
you also need plenty of disc space. The CD creation scripts are packaged in
the <em>debian-cd</em> package. However, it is usually a better idea to use
the latest code from SVN. (Still, you should have a look at the package's
dependencies to ensure you have all the necessary tools.)</p>

<p>To get the latest SVN version, make sure you have SVN
installed. From an empty directory, give the following command:</p>

<div class="centerblock">
<p>
<tt>svn co svn://svn.debian.org/svn/debian-cd/trunk</tt>
</p>
</div>

<p>Should you try to use the scripts, check the
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd/">debian-cd mailing list
archive</a> for solutions to the problems that will inevitably
show up. :-)</p>
