<p>A <q>live install</q> image contains a Debian system that can boot without
modifying any files on the hard drive and also allows installation of Debian
from the contents of the image.
</p>

<p><a name="choose_live"><strong>Is a live image suitable for me?</strong></a> Here are some things
to consider that will help you decide.
<ul>
<li><b>Launcher:</b> In addition to text and GUI install options in the
boot menu, the desktop flavors contain a launcher on the desktop that can be
used to install while running the live image.
<li><b>Flavors:</b> The live images come in "flavors", four providing the
desktop environments GNOME, KDE, LXDE and Xfce, and two text console flavors:
rescue and standard. Many users will find these initial package selections
suitable, installing any additional packages they need from the network
afterwards.
<li><b>Architecture:</b> Only images for the two most popular architectures,
32-bit PC (i386) and 64-bit PC (amd64), are currently provided.
<li><b>Size:</b> Each image is much smaller than the full set of CD/DVD images,
but larger than the network install media. If you are installing from optical
media, the standard and rescue images will fit on a CD, whereas the others
require a DVD.  If you are installing from a USB key, only LXDE, Xfce, standard
and rescue will fit on a 1G device, whereas the others require a larger key.
<li><b>Languages:</b> The images do not contain a complete set of language
support packages. If you need input methods, fonts and supplemental language
packages for your language, you'll need to install these afterwards.
