<p>A <q>live install</q> image contains a Debian system that can boot without
modifying any files on the hard drive and also allows installation of Debian
from the contents of the image.
</p>

<p><a name="choose_live"><strong>Is a live image suitable for me?</strong></a> Here are some things
to consider that will help you decide.
<ul>
<li><b>Flavors:</b> The live images come in several "flavors"
providing a choice of desktop environments (GNOME, KDE, LXDE, Xfce,
Cinnamon and MATE). Many users will find these initial package
selections suitable, installing any additional packages they need from
the network afterwards.
<li><b>Architecture:</b> Only images for the two most popular architectures,
32-bit PC (i386) and 64-bit PC (amd64), are currently provided.
<li><b>Size:</b> Each image is much smaller than the full set of
DVD images, but larger than the network install media.
<li><b>Languages:</b> The images do not contain a complete set of language
support packages. If you need input methods, fonts and supplemental language
packages for your language, you'll need to install these afterwards.
</ul>

<p>The following live install images are available for download:</p>
