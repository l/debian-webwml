#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Downloading Debian CD images with jigdo" BARETITLE=true

<p>Jigsaw Download, or short <a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/">jigdo</a>,
is intended to be the main way of distributing Debian CD images in the
future. Currently, the system works, but is not yet very comfortable to use
because the download manager application is not finished. <em>At the moment,
you need a Linux/Unix system to use jigdo.</em></p>

<p><strong>Why is jigdo better than a direct download?</strong> Because it
is faster! For various reasons, there are far fewer mirrors for CD images
than there are for the "normal" Debian archive. Consequently, if you
download from a CD image mirror, that mirror will not only be further away
from you, it will also be overloaded, especially just after a release.</p>

<p>Of course, a "normal" Debian mirror does not carry any CD images, so how
can jigdo download them there? jigdo achieves this by downloading
individually all the files that are on the CD. In the next step, all these
files are assembled in one big file which (if the moon is full and you have
been standing on one leg while chanting ancient and almost-forgotten
incantations) is an exact copy of the CD image. However, all this happens
behind the scenes - all that <em>you</em> need to do is tell the download
tool the location of a "<tt>.jigdo</tt>" file to process.</p>

<p><strong>What steps are necessary to download an image with
jigdo?</strong></p>

<ul>

  <li>
    <p>Download a package containing the <tt>jigdo-lite</tt> script and
    <tt>jigdo-file</tt> program:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Debian Linux:
      <a href="http://atterer.net/debian/dists/unstable/jigdo/binary-i386/jigdo-file_0.6.1_i386.deb">\
      0.6.1 package for i386</a>. If you want automatic upgrades via apt,
      see the <a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/">jigdo homepage</a> for a
      line to add to your <tt>/etc/apt/sources.list</tt>.</li>

#      <li>Other Linux distributions: <a href="">tar.gz archive for
#      i386</a>, contains binaries and documentation</li>

      <li>Other Linux/Unix systems:
      <a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/jigdo-0.6.1.tar.gz">Source code for
      0.6.1</a>. Unpack, then execute
      "<tt>./configure&nbsp;&amp;&amp;&nbsp;make&nbsp;bindist</tt>" to
      create a tar.gz archive with binaries and documentation.</li>
    </ul>

  </li>

  <li>Run the <tt>jigdo-lite</tt> script. It will ask for the URL
  of a "<tt>.jigdo</tt>" file to process. (You can also supply
  that URL on the command line if you like.)</li>

  <li>Go to the <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~atterer/jigdo/">Debian
  CD jigdo site</a>, pick what you want to download and enter the URL of
  that "<tt>.jigdo</tt>" file.</li>

  <li>Follow the instructions printed by the script. If all goes well, the
  script finishes by calculating a checksum of the generated image and
  telling you that the checksum matches that of the original image.</li>

</ul>

<p>jigdo is capable of "upgrading" an older version of a CD image to the
supplied image - in this case, only what has changed will be downloaded.
Also, people running their own local Debian mirror can supply a "file:" URL
when asked for the mirror URI.</p>

<p>If you want to have a look at the prototype of the GUI download
application or some experimental binaries for Windows, see the
<a href="http://atterer.net/jigdo/">jigdo homepage</a>. Volunteers willing
to help with jigdo development are always welcome!</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Aargh! The script fails with an error - have I downloaded all
those MBs in vain?!</strong></p>

<p>Of course this Should Not Happen(tm), but for various reasons you may end
up in a state where a large "<tt>.iso.tmp</tt>" file has already been
generated and <tt>jigdo-lite</tt> appears to have problems, telling you
repeatedly to try restarting the download. At the moment, the only solution
that does <em>not</em> involve downloading all the data again is to revert
to <tt><a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a></tt>. Rename
<tt>jigdo-lite</tt>'s temporary file to remove the "<tt>.tmp</tt>"
extension, then use one of the
<a href="../mirroring/rsync-mirrors.html">rsync mirrors</a> to retrieve the
missing parts of the image.</p>
