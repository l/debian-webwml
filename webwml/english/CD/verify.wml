<p>
Official releases of Debian CDs come with signed checksum files;
look for them alongside the images in the <code>iso-cd</code>,
<code>jigdo-dvd</code>, <code>iso-hybrid</code> etc. directories.
These allow you to check that the images you download are correct.
First of all, the checksum can be used to check that the CDs have not
been corrupted during download.
Secondly, the signatures on the checksum files allow you to confirm
that the files are the ones officially released by the Debian CD /
Debian Live team and have not been tampered with.

<p>
To validate the contents of a CD image, just be sure to use the
appropriate checksum tool.
For recent releases, cryptographically strong checksum
algorithms (SHA256 and SHA512) are used; you should use the tools
<code>sha256sum</code> or <code>sha512sum</code> to work with these.
For CD releases older than Debian 6, you have to use the
<code>sha1sum</code> or <code>md5sum</code> tools, depending on which
checksums have been generated for that releases.
</p>

<p>
To ensure that the checksums files themselves are correct, use GnuPG to
verify them against the accompanying signature files (e.g.
<code>SHA512SUMS.sign</code>).
The keys used for these signatures are all in the <a
href="http://keyring.debian.org">Debian GPG keyring</a> and the best
way to check them is to use that keyring to validate via the web of
trust.
To make life easier for users, here are the fingerprints for the keys
that have been used for releases in recent years:
