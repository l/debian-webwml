<p>
Official releases of Debian CDs come with signed checksum files.
These allow you to check that the images you download are correct.
First of all, the checksum can be used to check that the CDs have not
been corrupted during download.
Secondly, the signatures on the checksum files allow you to confirm
that the files are the ones officially released by the Debian CD /
Debian Live team and have not been tampered with.
</p>

<p>
To validate the contents of a CD image, just be sure to use the
appropriate checksum tool.
For older archived CD releases, only MD5 checksums were generated in
the <code>MD5SUMS</code> files; you should use the tool
<code>md5sum</code> to work with these.
For newer releases, newer and cryptographically stronger checksum
algorithms (SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512) are used, and there are equivalent
tools available to work with these.
</p>

<p>
To ensure that the checksums files themselves are correct, use GnuPG to
verify them against the accompanying signature files (e.g.
<code>MD5SSUMS.sign</code>).
The keys used for these signatures are all in the <a
href="http://keyring.debian.org">Debian GPG keyring</a> and the best
way to check them is to use that keyring to validate via the web of
trust.
To make life easier for users, here are the fingerprints for the keys
that have been used for releases in recent years (with some UIDs
removed for clarity):

Official <q>role</q> keys have gradually replaced the use of personal
keys belonging to developers.
However, a decision was made not to go back and re-sign all the old
releases that were already signed using the older keys.
