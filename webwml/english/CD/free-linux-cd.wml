# Translators, I would not bother translating this file. Its sole
# purpose is to prevent stupid "Please send me a free Linux CD" mails
# to debian-cd. Apparently, this is another self-perpetuating Google
# flop: Whenever people from India (or somewhere from that part of the
# world) search for "Free Linux CD" with Google, the archived "free
# Linux CD" mails from lists.d.o turn up at the very top. Without
# bothering to read the replies to the archived mails, people copy the
# mail they found and send it to debian-cd.

<h1>Free Linux CD</h1>

<p>The Debian project does <em>not</em> send out free CDs. Please do
not send mail to the debian-cd mailing list about this.</p>

<p>Instead, either <a href="./">download</a> the CD images yourself or
<a href="vendors/">buy</a> them from one of our CD
vendors. Alternatively, search for a Linux User Group (LUG) in your
area, you may be able to get a <em>free Linux CD</em> at a LUG
meeting.</p>
