<p><a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a>
is a peer to peer download system optimised for large numbers of
downloaders. It puts minimal load on our servers because BitTorrent clients
upload pieces of files to others while downloading, thus spreading the load
accross the network and making blazing fast downloads possible.
</p>

<p>
You will need a BitTorrent client to download Debian CDs this way. In the
Debian distribution, this is packaged in the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/bittorrent">bittorrent package</a>;
clients are also available for
<a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html">other operating
systems</a>.
</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/torrents/">Official
  bittorrent files</a> for the "stable" release on CD
  </li>

</ul>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/pub/weekly/torrents/">Official
  bittorrent files</a> for the "testing" distribution on CD
  (<em>all architectures, regenerated weekly</em>)
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
If you can, please leave your client running after your download is complete,
to help others download images faster!
