<p><a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/">BitTorrent</a>
is a peer to peer download system optimised for large numbers of
downloaders. It puts minimal load on our servers because BitTorrent clients
upload pieces of files to others while downloading, thus spreading the load
across the network and making blazing fast downloads possible.
</p>

<p>
You will need a BitTorrent client to download Debian CDs this way. In the
Debian distribution, this is packaged in the
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/bittorrent">bittorrent package</a>;
clients are also available for
<a href="http://bitconjurer.org/BitTorrent/download.html">other operating
systems</a>.
