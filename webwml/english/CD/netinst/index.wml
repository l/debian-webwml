<p>A <q>network install</q> or <q>netinst</q> CD is a single CD which enables
you to install the entire operating system. This single CD contains
just the minimal amount of software to start the installation and
fetch the remaining packages over the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>What's better for me &mdash; the minimal bootable CD-ROM or the
full CDs?</strong> It depends, but we think that in many cases the
minimal CD image is better &mdash; above all, you only download the packages
that you selected for installation on your machine, which saves both
time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the full CDs are more suitable
when installing on more than one machine, or on machines without a
free Internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>What types of network connections are supported
during installation?</strong>
The network install assumes that you have a connection to the
Internet. Various different ways are supported for this, like
analogue PPP dial-up, Ethernet, WLAN (with some restrictions), but 
ISDN is not &mdash; sorry!</p>

<p>The following minimal bootable CD images are available for
download:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Official <q>netinst</q> images for the <q>stable</q> release &mdash; <a

  <li>Images for the <q>testing</q> release, both daily builds and known
  working snapshots, see the <a
