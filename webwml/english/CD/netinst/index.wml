#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Network install from a minimal CD"

<p><strong>What's better for me - the minimal bootable CD-ROM or the
full CDs?</strong> It depends, but we think that in many cases the
minimal CD image is better - above all, you only download the packages
that you selected for installation on your machine, which saves both
time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the full CDs are more suitable
when installing on more than one machine, or on machines without a
free Internet connection.</p>

<p>The network install assumes that either an analogue PPP dialup
connection to your Internet provider, or Internet access via Ethernet
(possibly using a PCMCIA card in your laptop) is available. It does
not support <strong>internal</strong> ISDN cards - sorry! At some
point, we hope to provide official credit card sized CD images which
also work for installing with internal ISDN cards. Unfortunately, at
the moment there are only unofficial images made by some people:</p>
