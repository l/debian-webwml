#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Network install from a minimal CD"

<p><strong>What's better for me - the minimal bootable CD-ROM or the
full CDs?</strong> It depends, but we think that in many cases the
minimal CD image is better - above all, you only download the packages
that you selected for installation on your machine, which saves both
time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the full CDs are more suitable
when installing on more than one machine, or on machines without a
free Internet connection.</p>

<p>The network install assumes that you have a connection to the
Internet either using analogue PPP dial-up or using an ethernet
connection. This may be through a PCMCIA adapter on laptops. Internal
(PCI) ISDN cards are not supported - sorry!</p>

<h2>Official net install images for the "testing" release</h2>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://gluck.debian.org/cdimage/testing/netinst/">\
  Official "testing" images</a>, built daily, in two sizes
  ("businesscard" = 40&nbsp;MB, "netinst" = 110&nbsp;MB). It is not
  possible to use these images to install the stable release.
  <p>
  The images are <strong>only intended for testing the new
  installer</strong> for sarge. The <a href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/">\
  Debian Installer</a> is still under development, so the installation may
  fail.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For information what these files are and how to use them, please see
the <a href="../faq/">FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have downloaded the images, be sure to have a look at the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">detailed
information about the installation process</a>.</p>
