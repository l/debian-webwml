<p>A "network install" or "netinst" CD is a single CD which enables
you to install the entire operating system. This single CD contains
just the minimal amount of software to start the installation and
fetch the remaining packages over the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>What's better for me - the minimal bootable CD-ROM or the
full CDs?</strong> It depends, but we think that in many cases the
minimal CD image is better - above all, you only download the packages
that you selected for installation on your machine, which saves both
time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the full CDs are more suitable
when installing on more than one machine, or on machines without a
free Internet connection.</p>

<p><strong>What types of network connections are supported?</strong>
The network install assumes that you have a connection to the
Internet either using analogue PPP dial-up or using an ethernet
connection. This may be through a PCMCIA adapter on laptops. Internal
(PCI) ISDN cards and WLAN cards are not supported - sorry!</p>

<p><strong>The image size is larger than the 180&nbsp;MB/40&nbsp;MB
mentioned below!</strong> Yes - at the moment, the size is only
checked for the i386 architecture, other architectures may exceed the
given sizes.</p>

<p>The following minimal bootable CD images are available for
download:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Official "netinst" images for the "stable" release - <a
  href="#netinst-stable">see below</a></li>

  <li>Official "businesscard" images for the "stable" release - <a
  href="#businesscard-stable">see below</a></li>

  <li>Images for the "testing" release, both daily builds and known
  working snapshots, see the <a
  href="$(DEVEL)/debian-installer/">Debian-Installer page</a>.</li>

</ul>


<h2 id="netinst-stable">Official netinst images for the "stable" release</h2>

<p>Up to 180&nbsp;MB in size, this image is suitable for writing to
small CD-R(W) media, 80&nbsp;mm/3.1" in diameter. The image contains the
installer and a small set of packages which allows the installation of
a (very) basic system.</p>

  <images-list url="http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/3.1_r0a/@ARCH@/iso-cd/debian-31r0a-@ARCH@-netinst.iso" arch="<strip-arches "<stable-images-arches />" s390 />" />
  </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="businesscard-stable">Official businesscard images for the
"stable" release</h2>

<p>This image has a size of up to 40&nbsp;MB. It is small enough to
fit on business card-shaped CDs (available in differing sizes,
e.g. 58&times;75&nbsp;mm/2.3&times;3"). This image contains just the
bare necessities to start a Debian installation, i.e. those parts of
the installer which are necessary to configure networking and download
the rest of the installation system.</p>
