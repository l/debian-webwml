#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Network install from a minimal CD"

<p><strong>What's better for me - the minimal bootable CD-ROM or the
full CDs?</strong> It depends, but we think that in many cases the
minimal CD image is better - above all, you only download the packages
that you selected for installation on your machine, which saves both
time and bandwidth. On the other hand, the full CDs are more suitable
when installing on more than one machine, or on machines without a
free Internet connection.</p>

<p>The network install assumes that you have a connection to the
Internet either using analogue PPP dial-up or using an ethernet
connection. This may be through a PCMCIA adapter on laptops. Internal
(PCI) ISDN cards are not supported - sorry!</p>
