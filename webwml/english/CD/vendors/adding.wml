#use wml::debian::template title="Adding new vendors to the CD vendors list"

<p>If you are considering selling Debian CDs, you should look at the Debian
<a href="info">vendor information</a> page.</p>

<p>If you would like to be added to the CD vendors page, send email, in English, to
<email "debian-www@lists.debian.org"> with the
following details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Vendor Name</li>
  <li>URL of Vendor</li>
  <li>Whether or not you donate some of the sale to Debian</li>
  <li>Type of CDs sold (see at the <a href="./">top of the main page</a> for details)</li>
  <li>Country you are in</li>
  <li>Do you ship orders overseas ("yes", "no", "some areas" or "within Europe")
  </li>
  <li>URL of a web page that has information about your Debian CDs</li>
  <li>Email address for sales enquiries</li>
  <li>What architectures your CDs are for.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important that you keep this information up to date. We try to
check the vendor sites every now and then and if, for example, the web page
no longer exists or mail bounces, we delete that entry.</p>

<p>You must have a web page (specified by the 'Debian URL' line) that
mentions the Debian CDs you sell. This entry is mandatory if you want to
be listed on our site.</p>
