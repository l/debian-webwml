#use wml::debian::template title="Information for CD vendors"

<p>From the number of letters sent to us, it seems that many of the
potential vendors are not familiar with Debian. This page simply
reiterates ideas on the rest of the web site of specific interest
to CD vendors.

<p>The most important ideas you should understand are the following:
<ul>
<li>All the software in the main distribution are released under a license that
complies with the <a href="../social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software
Guidelines</a>. Furthermore, there are no restrictions on redistribution of the
collection of software (nor could there be given the license of the underlying software).
<li>We are a volunteer organization
<li>We sell no products
<li>If you decide to sell CDs containing any software from the non-free or non-us portions
of Debian, it is up to you, the vendor, to comply with any applicable laws.
In particular, you must negotiate any required licenses for material in non-free yourself.
</ul>

There are three possibilities for those who want to sell Debian CDs.
<ul>
<li>Become a reseller of an existing vendor. Use the list of known
<a href="./">vendors of Debian CDs</a> if you are looking for someone
to act as a supplier. It is important that Debian remain impartial so we
will not recommend suppliers.

<li>Produce your own CDs using the <a href="../">Official
Debian CD Images</a>. Note: <em>if you just want to install Debian, then you do not
want these images, but want to do an ftp install or <a href="./">buy a CD</a>.</em>
Note that it is possible to sell the 'Official Debian CD', and add a extra disk
containing vendor additions and still use the term 'Official Debian CD'.

<li>Produce your own custom CDs. This requires you have a local copy of
the Debian archive.  Creating custom disks is not difficult, but it is the
vendors responsibility to test the disks before shipping. There have been
problems in the past with vendors selling customized CDs which are not up
to Debian's standards. For this reason, use of the term 'Official Debian CD'
is reserved for those who sell disks made from the Official Debian CD Images.
</ul>

If you would like to be listed on the Debian vendors page, send mail to
<a href="mailto:cdvendors@debian.org">cdvendors@debian.org</a> including
all the information needed for us to create an entry for you. See the vendors
page for a typical entry.
