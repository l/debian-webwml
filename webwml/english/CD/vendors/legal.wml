<p>Since the Debian system consists of a lot software which is
licensed under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU
General Public License</a> any distributor has to ensure the license
is not infringed.  Please read the explanations and the advice
below.</p>

<p>Distributing software which is licensed under the GNU GPL in object
code or executable form, either as CD image through the Internet or as
pressed or burned CD, requires the distributor (commercial or
non-commercial) to inform the person, who receives the binary form,
how to obtain the source code of the software.  The souce code has to
be provided to the user for a period of at least three years.
Pointing them only to an FTP server from a third party (i.e. the
Debian project) is not sufficient!</p>

<p>As the GPL says:</p>

<p>(1) The distributor can give the user a copy of the source.  (If they
are downloading the binary from some archive, then putting the source
on the same archive is good enough; the distributor doesn't have to
force the user to download it.)</p>

<p><center>OR</center></p>

<p>(2) The distributor can give the user a written offer to provide
the source to anyone (not merely ones own customers) at a later date
for a period of at least three years.  Pointing to a third party
(e.g. another company that sells source CDs) is not sufficient.  If
there's no written offer, the source has to be provided up front.  You
may charge a fee for providing the source, but only for what it costs
you to do so.</p>

<p><center>OR</center></p>

<p>(3) If the distributor is a non-profit organization, and if it has
received the binaries with an offer like in number (2) above, then the
distributor can merely pass on that offer.</p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>

<p>Any entity that distributes binary-only Debian CDs or images has to
provide CDs or images containing the matching source code for a period
of at least three years.  If no source CDs are provided regularily,
the easiest way to fulfil this requirement is to burn a CD containing
the relevant source archives and store it in a shelf.  When somebody
requests the source code, this can be fulfilled with a manually burned
copy.</p>

<p>The easiest way, however, is to distribute both binary and source
CDs at the same time and at the same price.  Since CDs are quite cheap
these days, this would not increase the price too significantly.
