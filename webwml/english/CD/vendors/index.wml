<p>Debian creates and provides its entire distribution free of charge.
Debian does not manufacture its own CDs, DVDs, BDs, or USBs, but relies
on third-party vendors. To make it easier for vendors to provide a
high quality disk, we provide official images for them. This is the
only version that has been fully tested by our testing team and is by
far the most popular way to buy Debian.</p>

<p>
 Some vendors allow customers to pay extra money and donate this to
 Debian. Others contribute a portion of sales of Debian disks back to
 Debian. This is indicated under <q>Allows Contributions.</q>
 We hope that you will consider making a donation to Debian.
</p>

<p>If you are having trouble with a vendor (e.g. you paid for
installation media but never received them), you can inform us by
sending mail to <email "debian-www@lists.debian.org">.</p>

<p>
 If you want to buy a computer system that has Debian already installed
 on it, go to the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/pre-installed">Debian Pre-installed Page</a>.
</p>

<p>If you are a Debian installation media vendor or you wish to
become one, please see <a href="info">the information for Debian CD
vendors</a>.</p>
