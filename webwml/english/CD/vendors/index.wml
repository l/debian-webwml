<p>Debian creates and provides its entire distribution free of charge. 
Debian does not manufacture its own CDs, but relies on 3rd party
vendors. To make it easier for CD vendors to provide a high quality
disk we provide Official CD images for them. This is the only version
that has been fully tested by our testing team and is by far the most
popular way to buy Debian.</p>

<p>
 The type of CD is indicated under each entry.
</p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   `Official CD' indicates that the vendor sells the Official Debian CD 
   set as distributed by us.
  </li>
  <li>
   `Development Snapshot' indicates the vendor sells a snapshot of the 
   unstable version of Debian. These are generally smaller runs and 
   cost more money. The frequency of the snapshots is also given. 
   These are mostly used by developers and others who like to live 
   on the edge.
  </li>
  <li>
   `Vendor Release' means the CD set is one created by the vendor 
   based on the Debian distribution. These usually include software 
   that are not on the Official CD. See the vendors web site for details.
  </li>
  <li>
   'Custom Release' means the vendor will create a CD set to your 
   specifications.
  </li>
  <li>
   `Multiple Distribution' means that Debian is only sold as part of a
   set of CDs including multiple distributions of Linux.
  </li>
  <li>
   'non-US' indicates that at least part of the collection of software
   that is not in the main Debian distribution due to United States export
   regulations or copyright restrictions is included.
  </li>
  <li>
   'non-free' indicates that at least part of the collection of software 
   deemed non-free by the 
   <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>
   but stored in the Debian archive is included. It is up to the
   vendor to negotiate the terms of distribution with the author of 
   the software.
  </li>
 </ul>
<p>
 Entries separated by a semi-colon, ';', are separate products.
</p>
<p>
 Some vendors allow customers to pay extra money and donate this to
 Debian. Others contribute a portion of sales of Debian CDs back to
 Debian. This is denoted under the entry 'Allows Contribution to
 Debian.'  We hope that you will consider making a donation to Debian.
</p>
<p>
 It is usually cheaper to find a vendor in your own country since shipping
 costs will be less. There are some vendors who find they can provide
 CDs for less money by buying CDs in bulk from a large vendor in
 another country and reselling them. Since some people find this
 confusing, resellers are clearly marked.  Note that this should have
 no effect on the quality of the disks.

 on it, go to the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/pre-installed">Debian Pre-installed Page</a>.

 Debian CDs are quite inexpensive, but you may be able to find an 
 even better deal if you don't mind getting a used, slightly dated, CD.
