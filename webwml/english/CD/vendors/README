Note to debian-www team members:

The processing of CD vendors is a manual process. The form data receiving
submissions from vendors (https://www.debian.org/CD/vendors/adding-form) is 
sent to the cdvendors@d.o alias which is forwarded to a number of 
people of the debian-www team.

If you want to get involved, please contact the webmaster in order
to have the alias file for the webteam modified.

Archives from the submissions are kept for historical purposes.
