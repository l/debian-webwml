## VENDOR DOESN'T RESPECT OUR POLICY (see [1]) ## 
## in the example the requirement not fullfilled is lack of shipping costs on
## the site, but obviously you can use the same mail for other requirements

Hi,
during the routine checks in order to [add your website to our cd vendor
list | update informations about your shop on our cd vendor page],
I've noted that you don't provide informations about shipping costs.
As these informations are explicitly request by our policy [1] on CD
vendors, can you please add them on your web page?

Please, let me know when you've done it: as soon as you'll do it, I'll be glad
to [add | update] your profile on our vendors page.

## COMPLAIN ABOUT VENDOR: REPLY TO THE USER ##
## (please, always cc cdvendors@debian.org)

8<----8<-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi,
thank you for the notice: I've emailed the vendor asking them what was
happened to your order.
Unfortunately the most we can do is drop the vendor from our webpage.

## COMPLAIN ABOUT VENDOR: MAIL TO THE VENDOR ##
## (please always cc cdvendors@debian.org)

8<----8<-------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,
the Debian Project has received a complaint of non-delivery of [CDs | DVDs]
by $user who ordered $date_of_order and already paid for a set of [CDs |
DVDs].

Can you let us know what was happened to this order?
If you're unable to, we will have to de-list you from the Debian CD vendors
webpage.

>8----->8------------------------------------------------------------------

## In case of complaint, stay in touch with the user until he received what
## ordered. If the complaint-mail is sent to a ML, remember to add a message in
## ML if there is an happy end (as we don't want to damage vendor's reputation 
## if he's not to blame).
