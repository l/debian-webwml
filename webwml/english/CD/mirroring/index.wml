#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Becoming a mirror for Debian CD images" BARETITLE=true

<p>To become a Debian CD Image mirror site, you need a Linux or
UNIX-like machine. Getting the images and making them accessible
can be done in several ways, depending on your possibilities.</p>

<p>You should <em>not</em> use FTP or HTTP to get the images. These transfer
methods have a high failure probability because of the enormous size of the
files. Moreover, if the images change only slightly (as is the case with
subreleases), the entire data is downloaded again. This puts a high stress
on our computers and network connections.</p>

<p>For these reasons, we use the <a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">\
<tt>rsync</tt></a> program that essentially performs remote binary patching.
With <tt>rsync</tt>, subrelease images are updated very efficiently, as only
the changed parts are transferred over the network; the unchanged parts are
copied from the old image.</p>

<p><tt>rsync</tt> alone still does full downloads for "all new" releases, as
those images contain virtually no unchanged parts. However, with the pseudo
image kit we can create "pseudo" CD images from data that is available
already on the nearest Debian FTP mirror - maybe on your own local hard
disc. Then <tt>rsync</tt> can binary patch these "pseudo-images" to the
official ones. And even for most subrelease images this is found to be more
efficient than patching the old image.</p>

<p>The pseudo image kit is designed mainly for downloading only one or a few
images, like most people do. There is also the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script
which makes mirroring <em>really</em> easy because it automatically uses the
pseudo image kit and <tt>rsync</tt> to keep your mirror up to date -- even
to the point of automatically MD5-checksumming every downloaded image. With
<tt>debcdmirror</tt>, you can also specify exactly what you want to
mirror.</p>

<p>So we have the following possibilities for getting the images and keeping
them up to date:</p>

<ul>

  <li>By FTP or HTTP: This should <em>not</em> be done.</li>

  <li>By using only <tt>rsync</tt> (daily cron job): This is preferable only
  on sites that do not have a nearby/fast Debian FTP mirror.</li>

  <li>By using the pseudo image kit manually (maybe with <tt>rsync</tt> to
  update subreleases). Lots of work and lots of trouble.</li>

  <li>By using the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script (which "internally" uses the
  Pseudo-Image Kit and <tt>rsync</tt>) (daily cron job). 
  <strong>This</strong> is what you should do! :-)</li>

</ul>

<p>The latest version of the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">pseudo
image kit</a> and the
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/debcdmirror/"><tt>debcdmirror</tt></a>
script are available from their author's homepage. Read the READMEs in both
packages for extensive information about the procedures.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong>

<p>For the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script, you must choose an <tt>rsync</tt>
mirror that offers an "<tt>ls-lR</tt>" file. Addresses are on the
<a href="rsync-mirrors.html">rsync mirror list</a>. Official public mirrors
are allowed to rsync directly from the master server, cdimage.debian.org;
you probably need a password for that one, ask
<a href="mailto:phil@hands.com">its administrator</a>.</p>

<p>If you do not have a local <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/">"regular" Debian
FTP mirror</a>, check the <a href="$(HOME)/distrib/ftplist" >list of FTP
sites</a>.

<p><tt>debcdmirror</tt> requires <tt>bash</tt> version 2 or higher. If
necessary you can install that in a non-default location, but then be sure
to update the path to <tt>bash</tt> in the first line of the script.</p>

<p>If you use <tt>rsync</tt> only, use at least the options <b><tt>--times
--links --hard-links --block-size=8192</tt></b>. This will preserve
modification time, symlinks and hardlinks, and use a block size of 8192
bytes (most efficient for CD images). When modification time and size are
the same, <tt>rsync</tt> will just leave the file alone, so <tt>--times</tt>
is really obligatory.</p>

<p>The "<tt><i>codename</i>_test</tt>" directory contains images that are
hard-linked to the ones in the versioned (e.g. <tt>2.2_r4</tt>) directories.
The versioned directory name will change between (sub)releases, but the
names in the "<tt>test</tt>" directories will stay the same. So, in the
<tt>rsync</tt>-only situation, mirroring both the versioned and the
appropriate "<tt>test</tt>" directories, <em>and</em> using the
<tt>--hard-links</tt> option is the only way for rsync to update subreleases
properly. [You should <em>not</em> include "<tt>test</tt>" directories with
<tt>debcdmirror</tt>, because <tt>debcdmirror</tt> will handle things
differently and more efficiently.]</p>

<p>The <tt>ls-lR</tt> file describes the directory structure of the mirror
it is on. <strong>Do not</strong> mirror the <tt>ls-lR</tt> file; either
make one yourself (with the provided "<tt>Makels-lR</tt>", every hour via
<tt>cron</tt>) or simply have no <tt>ls-lR</tt> file at all.
[<tt>debcdmirror</tt> will create a local <tt>ls-lR</tt> automatically after
mirroring.]</p>

<p>Once you have acquired the CD images you want to mirror (i386 and source
CDs are most popular), you should run the <tt>rsync</tt> server program.
This will not place a heavy load on your machine, and will generate much
less network traffic than an FTP/HTTP service. Instructions for setting this
up are in the README of the pseudo image kit.</p>

<p>Of course, if you do not have problems with many gigabytes of network
traffic per day, we'd very much appreciate another FTP/HTTP mirror. We'll be
happy with everything you can afford. Please notify
<a href="mailto:debian-cd@lists.debian.org">debian-cd@lists.debian.org</a>
that you are running a mirror, so that we can update the appropriate pages.
Thanks in advance!</p>
