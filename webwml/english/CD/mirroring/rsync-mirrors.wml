#use wml::debian::cdimage title="List of rsync mirrors for Debian CD images" BARETITLE=true

<p>These are the addresses of the Debian CD Image
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/">rsync</a> mirrors. Note that some mirrors
may not be completely up to date. This list only contains sites that carry
<em>official</em> Debian images.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> These sites do <em>not</em> necessarily offer the
images via FTP or HTTP - no use in trying! Instead, they use the rsync
protocol, which is much more efficient for our purposes. If you are looking
for HTTP/FTP download links, see the <a href="../http-ftp/">list of HTTP/FTP
mirrors</a>.</p>

<p>If you get "Access Denied" from a lot of sites, you are
probably behind a firewall that is blocking the rsync port (873).
Ask your system administrator to reconfigure the
firewall.</p>
