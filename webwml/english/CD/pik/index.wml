#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Downloading Debian CD images with the pseudo image kit" BARETITLE=true

<p>The pseudo image kit (PIK) allows you to download CD images from your
nearest Debian mirror. The PIK is available for Linux, other UNIX variants,
and Windows 95/98/NT.</p>

<p>The latest version of the Pseudo-Image Kit is available from <a
href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">its
author's homepage</a>. There are versions for UNIX (incl. Linux) and
Windows 95/98/NT. This is a set of programs that will construct a
"pseudo" CD image from data that is downloaded automatically from one
of the <a href="$(HOME)/mirror/list">Debian FTP mirrors</a> or
from a local disk. After this, binary patching is used to convert the
pseudo-image to the Official Image. This is done with the <a
href="http://rsync.samba.org/"><tt>rsync</tt></a> program, using one
of the <a href="../mirroring/rsync-mirrors" >Debian CD rsync
mirrors</a>. The README file in the Pseudo-Image Kit contains
extensive information about the procedure.</p>

<p>The Pseudo-Image Kit uses a Debian package mirror (maybe you're running
one yourself) to create the largest part of the CD image. There are many
fast Debian package mirrors, so this procedure is not only fast, but also
greatly lightens the load on the CD image mirrors, of which there are only
few. The network traffic to/from the CD image mirror is typically under 6 MB
(1% of the size of a CD image).</p>

<p>Only official releases of the "stable" distribution are made available
for distribution with the pseudo image kit.</p>

<p>Be sure to have a look at the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">detailed information about
the installation process</a>.</p>
