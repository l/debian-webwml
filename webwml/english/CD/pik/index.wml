#use wml::debian::cdimage title="Downloading Debian CD images with the pseudo image kit" BARETITLE=true

<p>The pseudo image kit (PIK) allows you to download CD images from your
nearest Debian mirror. The PIK is available for Linux, other UNIX variants,
and Windows 95/98/NT.</p>

<p>The latest version of the Pseudo-Image Kit is available from 
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">its author's
homepage</a>. There are versions for UNIX (incl. Linux) and Windows
95/98/NT. This is a set of programs that will construct a "pseudo" CD image
from data that is downloaded automatically from one of the 
<a href="$(HOME)/distrib/ftplist">Debian FTP mirrors</a> or from a local
disk. After this, binary patching is used to convert the pseudo-image to the
Offical Image. This is done with the
<a href="http://rsync.samba.org/"><tt>rsync</tt></a> program, using one of
the <a href="../mirroring/rsync-mirrors.html" >Debian CD rsync mirrors</a>.
The README file in the Pseudo-Image Kit contains extensive information about
the procedure.</p>

<p>The Pseudo-Image Kit uses a Debian package mirror (maybe you're running
one yourself) to create the largest part of the CD image. There are many
fast Debian package mirrors, so this procedure is not only fast, but also
greatly lightens the load on the CD image mirrors, of which there are only
few. The network traffic to/from the CD image mirror is typically under 6 MB
(1% of the size of a CD image).</p>

<p>Only official releases of the "stable" distribution are made available
for distribution with the pseudo image kit.</p>

<p>Be sure to have a look at the
<a href="$(HOME)/releases/stable/installmanual">detailed information about
the installation process</a>.</p>
