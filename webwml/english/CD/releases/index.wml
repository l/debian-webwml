    <p>The CD's README states that the CD is an unofficial beta. The

  <dt><strong>Official Debian 2.2 rev4 and rev4.1</strong></dt>
    <dd>\
    <p>The original 2.2rev4 CDs for the powerpc architecture
    were not bootable. They were regenerated - the resulting
    2.2rev4.1 release does not differ from 2.2rev4 except on
    powerpc.</p>\
    </dd>
# ------------------------------------------------------------
  <dt><strong>Official Debian 2.2 rev3</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Toshiba laptops are reported to have problems booting off the CDs
    because their BIOS
    <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0104/msg01326.html">cannot
    handle</a> 2.88MB boot images. The easiest way to start installing
    Debian on these machines is by running <tt>boot.bat</tt> from the
    <tt>install/</tt> directory of the Binary-1 CD.</p>

    <p>Not all packages from section "contrib" are included on the CDs,
    since they depend on non-free packages that are also not on the CDs.</p>

    <p>The problems with the <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode mouse driver have still
    not been resolved. See in the "2.2 rev0" section below for more
    info.</p>

  </dd>
# ------------------------------------------------------------

  <dt><strong>Official Debian 2.2 rev2</strong></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Not all packages from section "contrib" are included on
    the CDs, since they depend on non-free packages that are
    also not on the CDs.</p>

    <p>The problems with the <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode mouse
    driver have still not been resolved. See in the "2.2 rev0"
    section below for more info.</p>
  </dd>
# ------------------------------------------------------------

  <dt><strong>Official Debian 2.2 rev1</strong></dt>
  <dd><p>No CD images were created for the 2.2 rev1
  release.</p></dd>
# ------------------------------------------------------------

  <dt><strong>Official Debian 2.2 rev0</strong></dt>
    <dd>
    <p>Not all packages from section "contrib" are included on the CDs,
    since they depend on non-free packages that are also not on the CDs.</p>

    <p><strong>i386</strong>: There are some issues with the <tt>gpm</tt>
    text-mode mouse driver while running the X Window System. The easiest
    solution is to remove the line
    <tt>repeat_type=<i>&lt;something&gt;</i></tt> from
    <tt>/etc/gpm.conf</tt>, running "<tt>/etc/init.d/gpm&nbsp;restart</tt>"
    and then restart X.  Other solutions are possible, ask the
    <a href="mailto:gpm@packages.debian.org">gpm maintainer</a> to supply
    more documentation.</p>

    <p><strong>i386</strong>: The previously available Binary-2 CD image had
    a one-bit problem that prevented the package "<tt>pdksh</tt>" from being
    installed. Repairing your own image is very easy with the 
    <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.c">correct-i386-2.c</a>
    program.</p>

    <p>Thanks to <a href="mailto:kteague@sprocket.dhis.net">Ken Teague</a>
    we also have a precompiled 
    <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.zip">Windows
    version</a>; usage: extract the <tt>.zip</tt> in the dir where the
    <tt>binary-i386-2.iso</tt> file is sitting, then in a DOS box change to
    that directory and give the command "<tt>correct-i386-2
    binary-i386-2.iso</tt>".</p>

    <p>If you have a CD-ROM, which you obviously cannot repair, the easiest
    option to get <tt>pdksh</tt> is to 
    <a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/binary-i386/shells/pdksh_5.2.14-1.deb">download
    it</a> (212 kB) and install with "<tt>dpkg -i pdksh_5.2.14-1.deb</tt>". 
    But you can also copy the file from the CD to a temporary directory and
    use the same 
    <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.c">correct-i386-2.c</a>
    program, but then you should modify it so that <tt>POS</tt> is
    <tt>0x64de</tt>.</p>

    <p><strong>PowerPC</strong>: The powerpc Binary-1_NONUS and Binary-3 CD
    images are also plagued by a one-bit problem, preventing
    "<tt>smbfs</tt>" and "<tt>gimp-manual</tt>" respectively from being
    installed. Repaired versions are (slowly) propagating to the mirrors,
    but you can repair your own images very easily with the 
    <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/correct_cds/correct-powerpc-1_NONUS.c">correct-powerpc-1_NONUS.c</a>
    and 
    <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/correct_cds/correct-powerpc-3.c">correct-powerpc-3.c</a>
    programs. These also contain information on repairing the affected
    packages individually when copied from CD (which is especially useful
    for the 15MB-sized "<tt>gimp-manual</tt>").</p>

    <p><strong>Sparc</strong>: The 2.2 rev0 CDs have a problem when booting
    from the Binary-1 CD. This has been solved in the 2.2 rev0a (or
    2.2_rev0_CDa) version of the sparc CDs.</p>

    <p>Sparc: If X does not start correctly, and the error message mentions
    the mouse, and you are <i>not</i> running the <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode
    mouse driver, &quot;<tt>rm -f /dev/gpmdata</tt>&quot; might help.</p>

    <p><strong>Alpha</strong>: The 2.2 rev0 CDs may prove problematic when
    booting from the Binary-1 CD. To solve that, boot with "<tt>-flags
    i</tt>", then enter at the aboot prompt:
    <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aboot&gt; b /linux
      initrd=/boot/root.bin root=/dev/ram</tt>
    <br>
    This problem has been corrected in the 2.2 rev0a (or 2.2_rev0_CDa)
    version of the alpha CDs.</p>
