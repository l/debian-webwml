<p>If you want to obtain Debian GNU/Linux on CD, see below for the
available options. In case of problems, please check the <a
href="faq/">FAQ about Debian CDs</a>.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="netinst/">Download a minimal bootable CD image</a> (or
  <a href="../distrib/floppyinst">a couple of floppy disk images</a>). 
  Are you sure you really need the full CDs? You can just get the
  basic installation system - it will download the rest of the
  distribution if and when needed during the installation.</li>

  <li><a href="vendors/">Buy finished Debian CD-ROMs.</a> They are
  cheap - we do not make any profit with them! If your Internet
  connection is charged by the minute, this is your only choice. You
  might also consider buying the CDs if you only have a modem, as
  downloading the images via modem takes days.</li>

  <li><a href="jigdo-cd/">Download CD/DVD images with jigdo.</a>
  The "jigdo" scheme allows you to pick the fastest out of
  300 Debian mirrors worldwide for your download. It features easy
  mirror selection and "upgrading" of older images to the latest
  release. Also, it is the only way to download Debian DVD
  images for <em>all</em> architectures.</li>

  <li><a href="torrent-cd/">Download CD/DVD images with BitTorrent.</a>
  The Bittorrent peer to peer system lets many users cooperatively download
  images at the same time, with minimal load on our servers.
  DVD images are only available for some architectures.</li>
  
  <li><a href="http-ftp/">Download CD/DVD images using HTTP or FTP.</a>
  Due to space and bandwidth constraints, only very few mirrors are
  able to supply direct HTTP/FTP download links. <em>These sites may
  use bandwidth throttling,</em> downloads can be quite slow.
  Please use <a href="jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a> or 
  <a href="torrent-cd/">bittorrent</a> instead.
  DVD images are only available for some architectures and not on
  all mirrors.</li>

</ul>

<p>Debian is available for different computer architectures - make
sure you are getting images that match your computer! (Most people
will need images for "i386", i.e. Intel systems.) Once you have
created your own CDs, you might be interested in the <a
href="artwork/">artwork for covers of Debian CDs</a>.</p>
