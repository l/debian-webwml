<p>If you want to obtain Debian GNU/Linux using CDs, your options are:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="netinst/">Download a minimal bootable CD image</a>
  (or <a href="../distrib/floppyinst">a couple of floppy disk images</a>).
  Are you sure you really need the full CDs? You can just get the basic
  installation system and download the rest of Debian when you need it,
  during the installation.</li>

  <li><a href="vendors/">Buy finished Debian CD-ROMs.</a> They are cheap -
  we do not make any profit with them! If your Internet connection is
  charged by the minute, this is your only choice.  You might also consider
  buying the CDs if you only have a modem, as downloading the images via
  modem takes days.</li>

  <li><a href="http-ftp/">Download the official full CD images.</a> These are
  meant primarily for people who make large quantities of CDs. Downloading
  them would be very slow for most users, and the mirror sites <em>may use
  bandwidth throttling</em>.</li>

  <li><a href="pik/">Download CD images with the pseudo image kit.</a> The
  predecessor of the <a href="jigdo-cd/">jigdo scheme</a> shares most of its
  benefits, but is more complex to use and needs to access one of the few
  slower rsync servers for parts of the download.</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, another method of distributing CD images is currently in
its <strong>beta phase</strong>:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="jigdo-cd/">Download CD images with jigdo.</a> Recommended if
  you want to burn the complete Debian distribution onto CD-R. The "jigdo"
  scheme allows you to pick the fastest out of 200 Debian mirrors worldwide
  for your download.</li>

</ul>

<p>In case you encounter problems downloading or recording CD images, please
check the <a href="faq/">Frequently Asked Questions about Debian CD
images</a>. If the FAQ does not answer your question, you can also <a
href="faq/#mailing-list">ask on the <em>debian-cd</em> mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Debian is available for different computer architectures - make
sure you are getting images that match your computer! (Most people
will need images for "i386", i.e. Intel systems.)</p>

  <dd>
    The original 2.2rev4 CDs for the powerpc architecture were not
    bootable. They have been regenerated - the resulting 2.2rev4.1
    release does not differ from 2.2rev4 except on powerpc. &nbsp;
