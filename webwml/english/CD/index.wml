<p>If you want to obtain Debian GNU/Linux on CD, see below for the
available options. In case of problems, please check the <a
href="faq/">FAQ about Debian CDs</a>.</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="netinst/">Download a minimal bootable CD image</a> (or
  <a href="../distrib/floppyinst">a couple of floppy disk images</a>). 
  Are you sure you really need the full CDs? You can just get the
  basic installation system - it will download the rest of the
  distribution if and when needed during the installation.</li>

  <li><a href="vendors/">Buy finished Debian CD-ROMs.</a> They are
  cheap - we do not make any profit with them! If your Internet
  connection is charged by the minute, this is your only choice. You
  might also consider buying the CDs if you only have a modem, as
  downloading the images via modem takes days.</li>

  <li><a href="http-ftp/">Download CD images using HTTP or FTP.</a>
  Due to space and bandwidth constraints, only very few mirrors are
  able to supply direct HTTP/FTP download links. <em>These sites may
  use bandwidth throttling,</em> downloads can be quite slow.</li>

  <li><a href="pik/">Download CD images with the pseudo image kit.</a>
  The PIK can use any of the 200 Debian mirrors worldwide to download
  individual packages and create a CD image from them. This makes it
  faster than direct HTTP/FTP downloads. However, it is quite complex
  to use.</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, another method of distributing CD images is currently
in its <strong>beta phase</strong>:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="jigdo-cd/">Download CD images with jigdo.</a> Just like
  the PIK, the "jigdo" scheme allows you to pick the fastest out of
  200 Debian mirrors worldwide for your download. It features easy
  mirror selection and "upgrading" of older images to the latest
  release.</li>

</ul>

<p>Debian is available for different computer architectures - make
sure you are getting images that match your computer! (Most people
will need images for "i386", i.e. Intel systems.) Once you have
created your own CDs, you might be interested in the <a
href="artwork/">artwork for covers of Debian CDs</a>.</p>
