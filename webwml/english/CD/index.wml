<p>If you want to obtain Debian GNU/Linux using CDs, your options are:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="images/netinst/">Install directly from the network.</a> Are
  you sure you really need the full CDs? You can download only a minimal
  bootable CD image (or a couple of floppy disk images) containing the
  installation system. Provided your computer has an internet connection,
  the rest of the Debian distribution can be downloaded if and when needed
  during installation.</li>

  <li><a href="images/http-ftp/">Download official CD images directly via
  HTTP or FTP.</a> Due to space and bandwidth constraints, only very few
  sites are able to supply direct HTTP/FTP download links. <em>These sites
  may use bandwidth throttling</em>, downloads are bound to be slower than
  with <a href="jigdo-cd/">jigdo</a>.</li>

  <li><a href="vendors/">Buy finished Debian CD-ROMs.</a> They are cheap -
  we do not make any profit with them! If your Internet connection is
  charged by the minute, this is your only choice.  You might also consider
  buying the CDs if you only have a modem, as downloading the images via
  modem takes days.</li>

  <li><a href="pik/">Download CD images with the pseudo image kit.</a> The
  predecessor of the <a href="jigdo-cd/">jigdo scheme</a> shares most of its
  benefits, but is more complex to use and needs to access one of the few
  slower rsync servers for parts of the download.</li>

</ul>

<p>Additionally, another method of distributing CD images is currently in
its <strong>beta phase</strong>:</p>

<ul>

  <li><a href="jigdo-cd/">Download CD images with jigdo.</a> Recommended if
  you want to burn the complete Debian distribution onto CD-R. The "jigdo"
  scheme allows you to pick the fastest out of 200 Debian mirrors worldwide
  for your download.</li>

</ul>
