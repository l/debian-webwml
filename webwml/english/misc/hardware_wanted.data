 <wanted ARM machines and devices>
 <who ARM porters>
 <arch arm>
 <specs We are looking for ARM hardware.  For example, the Rebel (Corel)
  Netwinder is ARM-based.  Additionally, a number of ARM based NAS (Network
  Attached Storage) devices have come out recently which are interesting
  targets to which Debian could be ported.  This includes the Synology
  DS-101, Allnet 6500 (also known as Thecus N2100), and various Arm11/Cortex
  development boards.>

 <specs We are looking for little-endian hardware.  For example,
  DECstation machines and some Cobalt machines (RaQ, Qube, RaQ2, Qube2)
  are mipsel based>
