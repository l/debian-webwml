 <wanted m68k hardware (Amiga, Atari, Mac)>
 <who m68k porters>
 <arch m68k>
 <specs All kinds of m68k hardware; ideally with a 060 CPU, but machines
  with a 040 CPU are useful for our porting efforts as well>

 <wanted DECstations and Cobalt machines>
 <who MIPS porters>
 <arch mipsel>
 <specs We are looking for little-endian hardware.  For example,
  DECstation machines and some Cobalt machines (RaQ, Qube, RaQ2, Qube2)
  are mipsel based>
