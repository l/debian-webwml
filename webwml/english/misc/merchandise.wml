<P>
As Debian's popularity has grown, we have received many requests for Debian
merchandise. Being a non-profit organization, we don't make or sell anything
ourselves. Luckily, a number of companies have seen a potential market and
are trying to fill it. The information below is provided as a favor to our
loyal users.

<p>If you sell merchandise with a Debian theme and would like to be listed on
this page, write to webmaster@debian.org.
Please provide us with the following information: the company name, the url for
your main page, the url where Debian merchandise can be found, and the merchandise
sold. We are only interested in advertising Debian related gear. 

<p>Since we are protective of our reputation, we take customer service seriously.
If we receive complaints about your service, you will be removed from the page.
