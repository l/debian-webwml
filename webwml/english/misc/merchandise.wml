<P>
As Debian's popularity has grown, we have received many requests for Debian
merchandise. Being a non-profit organization, we don't make or sell anything
ourselves. Luckily, a number of companies have seen a potential market and
are trying to fill it. The information below is provided as a favor to our
loyal users. The ordering is purely alphabetical and no ranking or
endorsement of a specific vendor.

<p>If you sell merchandise with a Debian theme and would like to be listed on
this page, send mail <strong>in English</strong> to

Please provide us with the following information:
<ul>
  <li>the company name,
  <li>the URL for your main page,
  <li>the URL where Debian merchandise can be found, and
  <li>the list of Debian merchandise sold.

We are only interested in advertising Debian related gear.
