<P>
As Debian's popularity has grown, we have received many requests for Debian
merchandise. Being a non-profit organization, we don't make or sell anything
ourselves. Luckily, a number of companies have seen a potential market and
are trying to fill it. The information below is provided as a favor to our
loyal users.
