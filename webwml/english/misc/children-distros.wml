#use wml::debian::template title="Software distributions based on Debian" BARETITLE=true

<p>There are a number of distributions based on Debian. Some users
might want to take a look at these distributions <em>in addition to</em> the
official Debian releases. This is done for a number of reasons (better
localization support, specific hardware support, simplified installation,
etc).</p>

<p>Debian welcomes and encourages organisations that want to develop
new distributions based on Debian. However,
in the spirit of Debian's <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social
contract</a>, we ask them to contribute their work to the main distribution
so that ultimately, all users can benefit from improvements.</p>

<H2><a name="adamantix">Adamantix</a></H2>

<p>The Adamantix project (<url "http://www.adamantix.org/">) aims to
create a highly secure but usable Linux platform.  To accomplish this,
the project will use currently available security solutions for Linux
(like kernel patches, compiler patches, security related programs and
techniques) and knit these together to a highly secure Linux
platform.
</p>

</p>


<H2><a name="corel">Corel Linux</a></H2>

<p>Corel developed a distribution based on Debian bundled with its
WordPerfect and other Corel software. Corel chose Debian because
<q>...it offers an excellent fit with the company's existing
customer base and Linux mission. Debian has a solid charter, a strong
worldwide developer base and a thorough testing period</q> as
described in its 
# http://www.corel.com/news/1999/may/may_1999_faqs.htm
FAQ (no longer available).
It was released in <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/1999/44/">November
1999</a>, after a few public <a
href="http://old.lwn.net/1999/features/CorelLinux/">betas</a>. This
opened some discussion due to the fact that Corel had elected KDE
for its GUI, and KDE license issues were not yet solved within
Debian. Three different editions were published from 1999 to the end
of the year 2000. However, in the year 2001 it <a
href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/PressRelease/Details&amp;id=ZZZZ8DJU78T">announced</a>
its intention to spin off the Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>Corel Linux was available from http://linux.corel.com/.
Users wishing to upgrade to newer Debian releases can use, as a guideline,
the <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2000/25/mail#2">Corel to Debian
micro-howto</a> published in Debian support mailing lists.
</p>

<p>However, afterwards it was licensed to a new company called
Xandros Corporation <url "http://www.xandros.net/"> (see the <a
href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/PressRelease/Details&amp;id=ZZZZ8DJU86H">press
release</a>), a company which includes some of the developers and
architects of the original Corel Linux.

<H2><a name="linex">Linex</a></H2>

<P>Linex is a Debian-based distribution being developed by the regional
government of Extremadura (Spain). The main goal is to migrate
all the computer systems, from government offices, to businesses to
schools into Linux. Read
<a href="http://www.consultia.net/esnoticia/vernoticia.asp?id=3220&amp;seccion=1">the official press release</a>
(also available
<a href="http://lwn.net/2002/0425/a/linex.php3">in English</a>).

<P>Linex has drawn a lot of attention not just from non-Spanish newspapers
like the 
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A59197-2002Nov2&amp;notFound=true">Washington Post</A>,
but even from the European Parliament, where it was presented in
several occasions, the latest one in the annual meeting of the
European Regions Committee (news posted in February 2003
<a href="http://www.consultia.net/esnoticia/vernoticia.asp?id=4489&amp;seccion=2">
here</A> or 
<a href="http://www.elperiodicoextremadura.com/noticias/noticia.asp?pkid=40043">here</A>,
in Spanish only).

<H2><a name="linuxin">Linuxin</a></H2>

<P>Linuxin is a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (<em>woody</em>)
and is oriented towards the Spanish end-user (desktop)
with a simplified installation that includes 
<a href="http://linuxin.paislinux.net/index.php?page=Foro&amp;mensaje=48">hardware autodetection</A> 
and a <a href="http://linuxin.paislinux.net/Packages.txt">small package selection</A> 
directed towards users with little experience. All changes are distributed
under the GPL and some of the improvements will probably be merged
with the main Debian project.
</p>

<p>The CD images provide also a live filesystem so it can be used as
a demonstration CD (like <a href="#demolinux">Demolinux</a>). Some
programs might not work, however, due to RAMdisk limitations.
</p>

<p>CD images can be downloaded from the main website (all content is
in Spanish) at <url "http://linuxin.paislinux.net/"> 
or
at <url "http://jucar.aig.uc3m.es/linuxin/"> (probably higher bandwidth).
</p>


<H2><a name="morphix">Morphix</a></H2>

<p>Morphix, <url "http://www.morphix.org/">, is designed as a modular
framework to easily create and customize livecd's, with a range of
modules for different purposes. Based on Debian and KNOPPIX, it
emphasises ease-of-use, ease-of-install and, thanks to Debian and apt,
ease-of-updating. In such, it is a hybrid: the usefulness of a regular
livecd, and a dependable way to get a Debian install on your
harddisk. It does contain certain non-free drivers (nvidia driver),
which can be chosen at boottime, but these can be disabled for full
Debian compliance.
</p>

<p>Besides the custom-made opensource installer, the people behind
Morphix are active on creating a number of extra tools and
applications to increase the usefulness of Morphix for newer
users. These tools are also licensed under the GPL.
</p>

of best-of-breed desktop applications, and popular Chinese input
methods, all designed to enhance the desktop experience.

Debian GNU/Linux.

<H2><a name="storm">Storm Linux</a></H2>

<p>Storm was a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux which <a
href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/1999/27/">appeared in 1999</a> (the first
