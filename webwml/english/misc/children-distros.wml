#use wml::debian::template title="Software distributions based on Debian" BARETITLE=true

<p>There are a number of distributions based on Debian. Some users
might want to take a look at these distributions <em>in addition to</em> the
official Debian releases. This is done for a number of reasons (better
localization support, specific hardware support, simplified installation,
etc.).</p>

<p>Debian welcomes and encourages organisations that want to develop
new distributions based on Debian. However,
in the spirit of Debian's <a href="$(HOME)/social_contract">social
contract</a>, we ask them to contribute their work to the main distribution
so that ultimately, all users can benefit from improvements.</p>

<p>The following distributions are based on Debian (in alphabetical order,
not chronological). This list is far for complete and might be out of date,
if you find inaccurate data, want to contribute information or add
a distribution not listed here
please <a href="$(HOME)/contact#infrastructure">contact us</a>.
</p>

<p><em>Note</em>: for more detailed information of these distributions
including release dates, contents and reviews, please visit <url

# TODO:

<h2><a name="adamantix">Adamantix</a></h2>

<p>The <a href="http://www.adamantix.org/">Adamantix project</a> aims to
create a highly secure but usable Linux platform.  To accomplish this,
the project will use currently available security solutions for Linux
(like kernel patches, compiler patches, security related programs and
techniques) and knit these together to a highly secure Linux
platform.
</p>

<h2><a name="aplinux">APLINUX</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.aplinux.com.br/">APLINUX</a> was a distribution
based on Debian GNU/Linux focused on web servers, DNS servers and mail
servers. Its main goal was to automatize the tasks of installation and
configuration of the system, with the purpose to achieve the maximum
in trustworthiness, stability and security.</p>

<h2><a name="corel">Corel Linux</a></h2>

<p>Corel developed a distribution based on Debian bundled with its
WordPerfect and other Corel software. Corel chose Debian because
<q>...it offers an excellent fit with the company's existing
customer base and Linux mission. Debian has a solid charter, a strong
worldwide developer base and a thorough testing period</q> as
described in its 
# http://www.corel.com/news/1999/may/may_1999_faqs.htm
FAQ (no longer available).
It was released in <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/1999/44/">November
1999</a>, after a few public <a
href="http://old.lwn.net/1999/features/CorelLinux/">betas</a>. This
opened some discussion due to the fact that Corel had elected KDE
for its GUI, and KDE license issues were not yet solved within
Debian. Three different editions were published from 1999 to the end
of the year 2000. However, in the year 2001 it <a
href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/PressRelease/Details&amp;id=ZZZZ8DJU78T">announced</a>
its intention to spin off the Linux distribution.
</p>

<p>Corel Linux was available from http://linux.corel.com/.
Users wishing to upgrade to newer Debian releases can use, as a guideline,
the <a href="$(HOME)/News/weekly/2000/25/mail#2">Corel to Debian
micro-howto</a> published in Debian support mailing lists.
</p>

<p>However, afterwards it was licensed to a new company called
Xandros Corporation <url "http://www.xandros.net/" /> (see the <a
href="http://www3.corel.com/cgi-bin/gx.cgi/AppLogic+FTContentServer?pagename=Corel/PressRelease/Details&amp;id=ZZZZ8DJU86H">press

architects of the original Corel Linux.

<h2><a name="demolinux">Demolinux</a></h2>

<p>Demolinux is a distribution that allows a user to run Linux without
installation, disk partitioning or any related issues, since it works
from a bootable CD-ROM. Demolinux includes the GNOME and KDE
environments, Enlightenment, StarOffice, lots of games, development
tools, and a full load of utilities. It is probably the best
distribution to use if you want to just give Linux a try and see how
it works and what can it offer you.
</p>

<p>Since version 2.0 it is <a

(version 3.0 is <a

<h2><a name="grml">grml</a></h2>
<p><a href="http://grml.org/">grml</a> is a bootable CD (Live-CD) originally
based on Knoppix and nowadays based on Debian. grml includes a collection of
GNU/Linux software especially for system administrators and users of texttools.
grml provides automatic hardware detection. You can use grml (for example) as a
rescue system, for analyzing systems/networks or as a working environment. It
is not necessary to install anything to a harddisk; you don't even need a
harddisk to run it. Due to on-the-fly decompression grml includes about 2.1GB
of software and documentation on the CD. You don't have to pay anything to use
grml because it is free software!</p>

<h2><a name="linuxin">Linuxin</a></h2>

<p>Linuxin is a distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux 3.0 (<em>woody</em>)
and is oriented towards the Spanish end-user (desktop)
with a simplified installation that includes 
<a href="http://linuxin.paislinux.net/index.php?page=Foro&amp;mensaje=48">hardware autodetection</a> 
and a <a href="http://linuxin.paislinux.net/Packages.txt">small package selection</a> 
directed towards users with little experience. All changes are distributed
under the GPL and some of the improvements will probably be merged
with the main Debian project.
</p>

<p>The CD images provide also a live filesystem so it can be used as
a demonstration CD (like <a href="#demolinux">Demolinux</a>). Some
programs might not work, however, due to RAMdisk limitations.

<p>CD images can be downloaded from the main website (all content is

<h2><a name="morphix">Morphix</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.morphix.org/">Morphix</a> is designed as a modular
framework to easily create and customize livecd's, with a range of
modules for different purposes. Based on Debian and KNOPPIX, it
emphasises ease-of-use, ease-of-install and, thanks to Debian and apt,
ease-of-updating. In such, it is a hybrid: the usefulness of a regular
livecd, and a dependable way to get a Debian install on your
harddisk. It does contain certain non-free drivers (nvidia driver),
which can be chosen at boottime, but these can be disabled for full
Debian compliance.
</p>

<p>Besides the custom-made opensource installer, the people behind
Morphix are active on creating a number of extra tools and
applications to increase the usefulness of Morphix for newer
users. These tools are also licensed under the GPL.
