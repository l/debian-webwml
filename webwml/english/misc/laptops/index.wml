#use wml::debian::template title="Debian on the Go" NOHEADER="yes"
[ <a href="..">Ports</a> ] [ <b>Debian-Laptops</b> ]<p>


<P>Shalah,  This page is copied from the Beowulf page so much of the data
comes from that.  Modify this page to your heart's content.  Just leave the
first line (#use) in place (you can change the title, if you like).  And
keep the second line pretty much as in (you can add or rename as you like).

<P>The rest is easy.  Just use standard HTML to code the body of the page.
Any other pages you add, just include the top two lines and the pages will
continue to have a look that's uniform with the rest of Debian's web site.
The Makefile searches for all *.wml files and "makes" them.  It also
searches for *.gif and *.jpg files and installs them.  Any other file type
needs  to have the Makefile modified... check with us for details.

<P>If you add subdirectories, the Makefile will have to be modified to have
the subdir= set.  The www make system uses a diving make method.. it'll go
into each subdirectory and run make.  The easiest is to just copy the
Makefile from one directory up and changing the obvious.  That way all the
*.wml, *.gif and *.jpg files get handled in a uniform manner.
