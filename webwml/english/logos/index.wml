<P>Although Debian can be obtained for free and will always remain
that way, events such as the problem with the ownership of the
term "Linux" have shown that Debian needs to protect its
property from any use which could hurt its reputation.

<P>Debian has decided to create two logos.  One logo is for official Debian
use.  The other logo falls under an open use type license.

<B>Please note, the graphics are not yet available.  However, the xfig
files should be updated along with this page.</B>
