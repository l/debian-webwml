<p>Although Debian can be obtained for free and will always remain
that way, events such as the problem with the ownership of the
term &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; have shown that Debian needs to protect its
property from any use which could hurt its reputation.</p>

<p>Debian has decided to create two logos: <a href="#official-use">one
logo</a> is for official Debian use; the <a href="#open-use">other
logo</a> falls under an open use type license.</p>

<h2>About the Debian logo</h2>
<p>
The Debian logo was selected by a vote by the Debian developers in 1999.
It was created by <a href="mailto:rsilva@debian.org">Raul Silva</a>. You 
can find more details about the logo on the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLogo">Debian Logo Wiki Page</a>.</p>

<h2>Other promotional images</h2>

<p><img class="ico" src="button-1.gif" alt="[Debian GNU/Linux]" />

this logo is equivalent to the Open Use logo license.  The button was
created by <a href="mailto:csmall@debian.org">Craig Small</a>.</p>
