<p>Debian has two logos. The <a href="#open-use">official logo</a> (also known
  as "open use logo") contains the well-known Debian <q>swirl</q> and best
  represents the visual identity of the Debian Project. A separate, <a
  href="#restricted-use">restricted-use logo</a>, also exists for use by the
  Debian Project and its members only. To refer to Debian, please prefer the
  open use logo.</p>

<h2>About the Debian logo</h2>
<p>
The Debian logo was selected by a vote by the Debian developers in 1999.
It was created by <a href="mailto:rsilva@debian.org">Raul Silva</a>. You 
can find more details about the logo on the 
<a href="http://wiki.debian.org/DebianLogo">Debian Logo Wiki Page</a>.</p>

<h2>Other promotional images</h2>

<p><img class="ico" src="button-1.gif" alt="[Debian GNU/Linux]" />
This is the first button made for the Project.  The license of
this logo is equivalent to the Open Use logo license.  The button was
created by <a href="mailto:csmall@debian.org">Craig Small</a>.</p>
