<P>Although Debian can be obtained for free and will always remain
that way, events such as the problem with the ownership of the
term &ldquo;Linux&rdquo; have shown that Debian needs to protect its
property from any use which could hurt its reputation.

<P>Debian has decided to create two logos: <a href="#official-use">one
logo</a> is for official Debian use; the <a href="#open-use">other
logo</a> falls under an open use type license.
