<P>Although Debian can be obtained for free and will always remain
that way, events such as the problem with the ownership of the
term ``Linux'' have shown that Debian needs to protect its
property from any use which could hurt its reputation.

<P>Debian has decided to create two logos: <a href="#official-use">one
logo</a> is for official Debian use; the <a href="#open-use">other
logo</a> falls under an open use type license.

the Debian project, but does not indicate endorsement by the
project.

<P>It is not required, but we would appreciate, that when used on a web
