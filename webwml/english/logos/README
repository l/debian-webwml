About the Debian Logo:
======================
The swirl was done by Raul M. Silva
(see <https://www.debian.org/News/1999/19990826>)

<http://www.identifont.com/show?U5> -- "Poppl Laudatio Condensed" is the name
of the font that was used for the debian logo.  A commercial font that can be
bought from Berthold for 99$ (link to that on the above page).
