#use wml::debian::template title="HOWTO request a mailing list"

<P>The scope of this document is to help people establish a mailing
list at <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">lists.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>All new mailing lists need to have these basic prerequisites:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Basic purpose.
  <dd>
  This means that the topic the new mailing list would cover is appropriate
  for discussion on a permanent mailing list on lists.debian.org.
  <br>
  Some discussions are better suited for simple mail aliases, and mailing
  lists for simple package maintenance don't need lists here, they can be
  done in <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a> instead.
  Needless to mention, vanity or offtopic lists will not be created.</dd>

  <dt>Interested audience.
  <dd>
  This means that requests for new mailing lists need to be based on
  a real need for a new, separate discussion forum, rather than on
  the whim of the requester. A modicum of audience is also necessary
  to avoid temporary or transient mailing list requests.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once these two prerequisites have been obtained, a proper request
needs to be sent in as a <em>wishlist</em>
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">bug report</a> against the
<code><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</a></code>
pseudo-package.</p>

<p>The following information is required in the bug report:</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>

   <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
   <dd>
   	<p>Please choose a descriptive, short and unique name.</p>

	<p>Please note that every list name needs to be prefixed with a
	unique string, most commonly <code>debian-</code> for lists related
	to the Debian Project.

	<p>Lists for external projects don't need a prefix, as they will be
	created as <code><var>listname</var>@other.debian.org</code>.</p>

	<p>Words are separated with a dash, "-", so for example a list about
	"Foo bar" in relation to Debian would be called debian-foo-bar.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Rationale</strong></dt>
   <dd>
	<p>Full explanation on why do you want this list be created.</p>

	<p>The listmasters reserve the right to ask for consensus on
	debian-devel and / or debian-project lists first.
	If you are aware your request is questionable, you can speed up
	the process by discussing the matter even before filing the bug.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Short description</dt></strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<p>This is the one-line description, for display in list indices,
      	so make it short and straightforward.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Long description</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This description is meant for people who are looking for the
      	proper list to join, so make sure it's clear and informative.

    	<P>See <A HREF="subscribe">the subscription page</A> for examples.
	</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Category</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This is needed to classify the list and to properly sort it on
    	<a href="subscribe">the subscription page</a> and elsewhere.
	The available categories are:

		<UL>
			<LI>Users
			<LI>Developers
			<LI>Internationalization and Translations
			<LI>Ports
			<LI>Miscellaneous Debian
			<LI>Other
		</UL>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Subscription Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / closed

      <p>If closed, who may get subscribed, who can approve subscription
         requests?</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Post Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / moderated

      <p>If moderated, who are the moderators?</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Web Archive</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>yes / no

      <p>At <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">our mailing list archives</a>.
   </dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>After filing the request, it would be very much appreciated if several
other people interested in the new list would send a mail to the bug,
in order to record their interest.</p>

<p>Please follow the above rules, because improper requests will not be
implemented.</p>
