#use wml::debian::template title="HOWTO request a mailing list"

<P>The scope of this document is to help people establish a mailing
list at lists.debian.org.  The intention of this document is to
decrease the workload for the listmasters and to decrease annoying
discussions and superflous requests for stuff that is still missing.

<P>New lists will only be created if a (wishlist) bug report against
<code>lists.debian.org</code> exists and the required information is
provided in the bug report.

<P>The following information is required if you want to establish a
new list:

<br>&nbsp;

<OL>
   <li>Name

   	<P>Which list do you want to be created?

	<p>Please note that every list is prefixed by a unique string:
	
	<table bgcolor="#000000"><tr><td>
	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1">
   	<tr><td bgcolor="#72c9ff">Debian</td>                          <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><code>debian-</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="#72c9ff">Software in the Public Interest</td> <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><code>spi-</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="#72c9ff">Berlin</td>                          <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><code>berlin-</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="#72c9ff">Linux Documentation Project</td>     <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><code>ldp-</code></td></tr>
	<tr><td bgcolor="#72c9ff">Linux Standard Base</td>             <td bgcolor="#ffffff"><code>lsb-</code></td></tr>
	</table>
	</td></tr></table>

   	<P>The listmasters will add this string if required.

   	<P>Please keep the name descriptive, short and unique.  Subnames
   	are divided by a dash, `-'.

   	<P>If the name is not proper the listmasters will
        <strong>reject</strong> the request.

   <br>&nbsp;

   <li>Rationale

    <P>Why do you want this list be created, why is it important or
    similar.  Vanity lists (like debian-jokes etc.) will not be
    created.  Do not waste your (and our) time.

    <P>We will reserve the right to ask for consensus on debian-devel
    and / or debian-project lists first.  To speed it up you should do
    this for questionable lists.

   <br>&nbsp;

   <li>Long description

      	<P>This description is meant for people who are looking for the
      	proper list to join.  The description refers to the part of
      	Debian that will be covered.  It contains the purposes of the
      	list.

    	<P>See <A HREF="subscribe">the subscription page</A> for examples.

   <br>&nbsp;

   <li>Category

      	<P>This is needed to classify the list and to properly sort it on
    	<A HREF="subscribe">the subscription page</A>.

		<UL>
			<LI>Users
			<LI>Developers
			<LI>Internationalization and Translations
			<LI>Ports
			<LI>Miscellaneous Debian
			<LI>Other
		</UL>

   <br>&nbsp;

   <br>&nbsp;
