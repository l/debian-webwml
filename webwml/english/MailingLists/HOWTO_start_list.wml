#use wml::debian::template title="HOWTO request a mailing list"

<P>The scope of this document is to help people establish a mailing
list at <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">lists.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>All new mailing lists need to have these basic prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic purpose.
  <br>
  This means that the topic the new mailing list would cover is appropriate
  for discussion on a permanent mailing list on lists.debian.org.
  <br>
  Some discussions are better suited for simple mail aliases, and mailing
  lists for simple package maintenance don't need lists here.
  Needless to mention, vanity or offtopic lists will not be created.</li>

  <li>Interested audience.
  <br>
  This means that requests for new mailing lists need to be based on
  a real need for a new, separate discussion forum, rather than on
  the whim of the requester. A modicum of audience is also necessary
  to avoid temporary or transient mailing list requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these two prerequisites have been obtained, a proper request
needs to be sent in as a <em>wishlist</em>
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">bug report</a> against the
<code><a href="https://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</a></code>
pseudo-package.</p>

<p>The following information is required in the bug report:</p>

<div class="centerblock">
<dl>

   <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
   <dd>
   	<p>Please choose a descriptive, short and unique name.</p>

	<p>Please note that every list name needs to be prefixed with a
	unique string, most commonly <code>debian-</code> for lists related
	to the Debian Project.

	<p>Lists for external projects don't need a prefix, as they will be
	created as <code><var>listname</var>@other.debian.org</code>.</p>

	<p>Words are separated with a dash, "-", so for example a list about
	"Foo bar" in relation to Debian would be called debian-foo-bar.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Rationale</strong></dt>
   <dd>
	<p>Full explanation on why do you want this list be created.</p>

	<p>The listmasters reserve the right to ask for consensus on
	debian-devel and / or debian-project lists first.
	If you are aware your request is questionable, you can speed up
	the process by discussing the matter even before filing the bug.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Short description</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<p>This is the one-line description, for display in list indices,
      	so make it short and straightforward.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Long description</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This description is meant for people who are looking for the
      	proper list to join, so make sure it's clear and informative.

    	<P>See <A HREF="subscribe">the subscription page</A> for examples.
	</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Category</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This is needed to classify the list and to properly sort it on
    	<a href="subscribe">the subscription page</a> and elsewhere.
	The available categories are:

		<UL>
			<LI>Users
			<LI>Developers
			<LI>Internationalization and Translations
			<LI>Ports
			<LI>Miscellaneous Debian
			<LI>Other
		</UL>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Subscription Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / closed

      <p>If closed, who may get subscribed, who can approve subscription
         requests? We usually don't support closed lists, you need a very
         good reasoning for requesting such a list.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Post Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / moderated

      <p>If moderated, who are the moderators?
         We usually don't support moderated lists, you need a very
         good reasoning for requesting such a list. There also doesn't exist
         a webfrontend or something like that. Moderation is done by mail
         only.
      </p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Web Archive</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>yes / no

      <p>At <a href="https://lists.debian.org/">our mailing list archives.</a>.
      We do expect for list archives to be public, you do need a good reason
      for not having a web archive.
   </dd>

</dl>
</div>

<p>After filing the request, it would be very much appreciated if several
other people interested in the new list would send a mail to the bug,
in order to record their interest.</p>

<p>Please follow the above rules, because improper requests will not be
implemented.</p>

<h3>Moving existing mailing lists to lists.debian.org</h3>

<p>An existing mailing list can be moved to lists.debian.org: the
administrator of the list has to submit a request as described above and
provide us with a list of subscribers (in plain text format, one address
per line). Archives of the existing list can also be imported from files
in mbox format (preferably split per month).</p>

<p>In addition to that, they should set up redirections from
the old location to the new one, of course.</p>
