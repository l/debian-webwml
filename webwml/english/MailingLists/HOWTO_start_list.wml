#use wml::debian::template title="HOWTO request a mailing list"

<P>The scope of this document is to help people establish a mailing
list at <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">lists.debian.org</a>.</p>

<p>All new mailing lists need to have these basic prerequisites:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Basic purpose.
  <br>
  This means that the topic the new mailing list would cover is appropriate
  for discussion on a permanent mailing list on lists.debian.org.
  <br>
  Some discussions are better suited for simple mail aliases, and mailing
  lists for simple package maintenance don't need lists here, they can be
  done in <a href="http://alioth.debian.org/">Alioth</a> instead.
  Needless to mention, vanity or offtopic lists will not be created.</li>

  <li>Interested audience.
  <br>
  This means that requests for new mailing lists need to be based on
  a real need for a new, separate discussion forum, rather than on
  the whim of the requester. A modicum of audience is also necessary
  to avoid temporary or transient mailing list requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once these two prerequisites have been obtained, a proper request
needs to be sent in as a <em>wishlist</em>
<a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/Reporting">bug report</a> against the
<code><a href="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</a></code>
pseudo-package.</p>

<p>The following information is required in the bug report:</p>

<blockquote>
<dl>

   <dt><strong>Name</strong></dt>
   <dd>
   	<p>Please choose a descriptive, short and unique name.</p>

	<p>Please note that every list name needs to be prefixed with a
	unique string, most commonly <code>debian-</code> for lists related
	to the Debian Project.

	<p>Lists for external projects don't need a prefix, as they will be
	created as <code><var>listname</var>@other.debian.org</code>.</p>

	<p>Words are separated with a dash, "-", so for example a list about
	"Foo bar" in relation to Debian would be called debian-foo-bar.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Rationale</strong></dt>
   <dd>
	<p>Full explanation on why do you want this list be created.</p>

	<p>The listmasters reserve the right to ask for consensus on
	debian-devel and / or debian-project lists first.
	If you are aware your request is questionable, you can speed up
	the process by discussing the matter even before filing the bug.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Short description</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<p>This is the one-line description, for display in list indices,
      	so make it short and straightforward.</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Long description</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This description is meant for people who are looking for the
      	proper list to join, so make sure it's clear and informative.

    	<P>See <A HREF="subscribe">the subscription page</A> for examples.
	</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Category</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      	<P>This is needed to classify the list and to properly sort it on
    	<a href="subscribe">the subscription page</a> and elsewhere.
	The available categories are:

		<UL>
			<LI>Users
			<LI>Developers
			<LI>Internationalization and Translations
			<LI>Ports
			<LI>Miscellaneous Debian
			<LI>Other
		</UL>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Subscription Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / closed

      <p>If closed, who may get subscribed, who can approve subscription
         requests?</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Post Policy</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>open / moderated

      <p>If moderated, who are the moderators?</p>
   </dd>

   <dt><strong>Web Archive</strong></dt>
   <dd>
      <P>yes / no

      <p>At <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">our mailing list archives</a>.
   </dd>

</dl>
</blockquote>

<p>After filing the request, it would be very much appreciated if several
other people interested in the new list would send a mail to the bug,
in order to record their interest.</p>

<p>Please follow the above rules, because improper requests will not be
implemented.</p>

<p>It is also possible to move an existing mailing list to lists.debian.org but it
requires coordination between the administrator of the old list and
Debian's listmasters.  You have to be able to provide the lists of
subscribers (plain-text, one address per line) on request.</p>

<p>Once the new list is created, the administrator of the old list
should setup a mail redirection for old-address@list.example to
new-address@lists.debian.org and has to take care of administrative
requests (subscription/unsubscription) for the old list, for example
e.g.  by simply pointing out the fact that the list has migrateted and
can be (un)subscribed at new-address-request@lists.debian.org.</p>

<p>Existing archives of the old list can be imported if they are
provided in mbox-format, one file per month.</p>
