<p><b>Our archives are public.</b> By posting to a public forum, you
agree to public distribution of your article.  All mails sent to any
of our <a href="$(HOME)/MailingLists/subscribe">mailing lists</a> and
to the <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/">bug tracking system</a> will
be distributed publically and archived in our <a
href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</a>.

<p>After review with several legal counsels, the Debian project has
determined that it is under no obligation to remove anyones emails
from the list archive.  The mailing list archives were public well
before a message to that mailing list address.  You are responsible
for determining who it is you are sending your email to.  You cannot
send email to arbitrary recipients and expect that they are
automatically forced into accepting your terms for receiving your
email.

<p>Any emails sent by one person directly to the list, or replies by
others to these same emails to the list, are considered published, in
accordance with United States law.  Obviously the author still owns
the copyright to these emails, and their content.  That does not mean
we are under obligation to remove them, once published.
