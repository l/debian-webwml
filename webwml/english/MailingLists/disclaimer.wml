#use wml::debian::template title="Disclaimer for the Debian mailing lists" BARETITLE=true

<p><strong>Our mailing lists are public forums, and our mailing list
archives are public.</strong>

<p>By sending an email to such a public forum, you agree to public
distribution of your article.  All mails sent to any of our
<a href="subscribe">mailing lists</a> (and to the <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bug
tracking system</a>) will be publically distributed and archived in our
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</a>.

<p>Any emails sent by any one person directly to the list, or replies by
others to those emails sent to the list, are considered published, in
accordance with the United States law.

<p>Obviously the author still owns the copyright to the content of these
emails that they have written. However, that does <strong>not</strong> mean
that the Debian Project is under obligation to remove them from a list
archive once published. Several legal counsels have reviewed this stance and
confirmed it is correct.

<p>The mailing list archives have been public well before you sent a message
to that mailing list address.  You are responsible for determining who it is
you are sending your email to.  You cannot send email to arbitrary
recipients and expect that they are automatically forced into accepting your
terms for receiving your email.

<p>Debian accepts no responsibility for the opinions and information posted
on its mailing lists by others.</p>

<p>Debian disclaims all warranties with regard to information posted on its
mailing lists, whether posted by Debian or others; this disclaimer includes
all implied warranties of merchantability and fitness.  In no event shall
Debian be liable for any special, indirect or consequential damages, or
damages of any kind whatsoever, resulting from loss of use, data or profits,
arising out of or in connection with the use of any information posted on a
Debian mailing list.</p>

<p>By posting material, the posting party warrants and represents that it
owns the copyright with respect to such material, has received permission
from the copyright owner, or that the material is in the public domain.
The posting party further warrants and represents that it otherwise has the
full and unencumbered right to post such material and that such posting will
not infringe any rights or interests of others.</p>

<p>Debian does not generally monitor its mailing lists for inappropriate
postings, and does not undertake editorial control of postings. We do,
however, reserve the right to prevent posting to mailing lists in the event
of failure to comply with the mailing list code of conduct.</p>

<p>Some spam and virus filtering is applied to every message that goes through
debian lists. Roughly 1 in 400 messages that are sent to the list actually
make it through; the rest are discarded as spam.</p>
