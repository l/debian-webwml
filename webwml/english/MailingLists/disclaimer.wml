#use wml::debian::template title="Disclaimer for the Debian mailing lists" BARETITLE=true

<p><strong>Our mailing lists are public forums, and our mailing list
archives are public.</strong>

<p>By sending an email to such a public forum, you agree to public
distribution of your article.  All mails sent to any of our
<a href="subscribe">mailing lists</a> (and to the <a href="$(HOME)/Bugs/">bug
tracking system</a>) will be publically distributed and archived in our
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</a>.

<p>Any emails sent by any one person directly to the list, or replies by
others to those emails sent to the list, are considered published, in
accordance with the United States law.

<p>Obviously the author still owns the copyright to the content of these
emails that they have written. However, that does <strong>not</strong> mean
that the Debian Project is under obligation to remove them from a list
archive once published. Several legal counsels have reviewed this stance and
confirmed it is correct.

<p>The mailing list archives have been public well before you sent a message
to that mailing list address.  You are responsible for determining who it is
you are sending your email to.  You cannot send email to arbitrary
recipients and expect that they are automatically forced into accepting your
terms for receiving your email.
