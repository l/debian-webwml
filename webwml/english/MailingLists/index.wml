#use wml::debian::template title="Mailing Lists"

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore e-mail is a preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several mailing lists.

<P>There are several world-open mailing lists while there are also some
lists which are only open to active developers. Please don't interpret this
as closed development, everyone is encouraged to help development of Debian
and to spread the word of free software. On the other hand it doesn't make
much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

<P>All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server with a mail
transport agent that is optimized for lists, called Smartlist. This server
is called lists.debian.org. All submission, subscription and unsubscription
messages have to go to a particular address at this host.

<P>The language used on all lists is English unless stated otherwise.
There are also some user lists for other languages available.

<P>For information on the mailing lists and how to subscribe to them, see the
<A href="subscribe">Subscription Page</A>. For information on unsubscribing,
see the <A href="unsubscribe">Unsubscription Page</A>.

<P>You can also view (and search for) old posts to the mailing lists using
the <A href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</A>.

<P>If you wish to request a new mailing list, please read the
<A HREF="HOWTO_start_list">HOWTO</A>. To contact the list maintainer,
send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A>
or <A HREF="../Bugs/Reporting">file a bug report</A> against the
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</A>
virtual package.
