#use wml::debian::template title="Mailing Lists"

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore, e-mail is the preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=mailing+list">mailing
lists</a>.

<P>There are many world-open mailing lists, meaning anyone can read
everything that is posted, and participate in the discussions. Everyone is
encouraged to help development of Debian and to spread the word of free
software. There are also a few lists which are only open to official Debian
developers; please don't interpret this as closed development, it sometimes
doesn't make much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

<P>All original Debian mailing lists are run on a special server, using an
automatic mail processing software called SmartList. This server
is called <code>lists.debian.org</code>. All submission, subscription and
unsubscription messages have to be sent to a particular address at this host.

<P>The language used on all lists is English, unless stated otherwise.
There are also some user lists for other languages available.

<h2><a name="subunsub">Subscription / Unsubscription</a></h2>

<p>Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open'.

<p>You can use simple web forms to <a href="subscribe">subscribe</a> or to
<a href="unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> from the lists. The
<a href="subscribe">list subscription web page</a> also contains a complete
list of all the mailing lists, along with a short description and the
subscription policy for each list.

<p>The requests for subscription or unsubscription can also be sent by
email, to a special control address, which is slightly different from the
lists address. <strong>Subscription or unsubscription messages should NOT be
sent to the address of the mailing list itself.</strong>

<p>To subscribe to or unsubscribe from a mailing list, please send mail to

<p><var>&lt;listname&gt;</var>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

<p>with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as Subject.

<p><strong>Please remember the -REQUEST part of the address.</strong>

<p>As part of the subscription process, the list software will send you an
email to which you must reply in order to finish subscribing. This is a
security measure to keep people from subscribing others to the lists without
their permission.

<h2>Mailing list archives</h2>

<p>Please note that all mails you send to our mailing lists will be
archived publically in our <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing
list archives</a>. Everyone can view and
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/search.html">search</a> for old posts to the
mailing lists in the archives.

<p>Some mailing list <a href="http://lists.debian.org/stats/">usage
statistics</a> are also available as well as a <a href="disclaimer">disclaimer</a>.

<h2>List maintenance</h2>

<P>If you wish to request a new mailing list, please read the
<A HREF="HOWTO_start_list">HOWTO</A>.

<p>To contact the list maintainer, send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A>
or <A HREF="../Bugs/Reporting">file a bug report</A> against the
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</A>
pseudo-package.

<h2><a name="ads">Debian mailing list advertising policy</a></h2>

<p>This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".

<p>The Debian mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment. The
fee for advertisments is a donation of USD 1000 or more to
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/donations">"Software in the Public Interest"
(SPI)</a>. One donation per advertisement, please. If you prefer to pay in
arrears, simply post your advertisement to the list, and the list operator
will bill you USD 1999. The list operator will donate this amount, minus
the expense of collecting it, to SPI. Please note that the lists are
distributed automatically &mdash; messages are generally not read or checked
in any way before they are distributed.

<p>The act of posting an advertisement indicates your willingness to
<ul>
  <li>accept responsibility for the fee,
  <li>indemnify the list operator against any legal claims from you or
      others in connection with your advertisement, and
  <li>pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
</ul>
Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your
message.

<p>Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the list operator in advance of posting
for any reduction or fee waiver.
