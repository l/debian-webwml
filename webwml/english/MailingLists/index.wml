<toc-add-entry name="intro">Introduction</toc-add-entry>

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore, e-mail is the preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=mailing+list">mailing
lists</a>.

<P>There are many world-open mailing lists, meaning anyone can read
everything that is posted, and participate in the discussions. Everyone is
encouraged to help development of Debian and to spread the word of free
software. There are also a few lists which are only open to official Debian
developers; please don't interpret this as closed development, it sometimes
doesn't make much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

<P>All original Debian mailing lists are run on a special server, using an
automatic mail processing software called SmartList. This server
is called <code><a href="http://lists.debian.org/">lists.debian.org</a></code>.
All submission, subscription and unsubscription messages have to be sent
to a particular address at this host.


<toc-add-entry name="basics">Basic use</toc-add-entry>

<p>Each Debian mailing list has a submission address in the form
<kbd><var>listname</var>@lists.debian.org</kbd>, a control request
address in the form <kbd><var>listname</var>-request@lists.debian.org</kbd>,
and a web page at <kbd>http://lists.debian.org/<var>listname</var>/</kbd>.</p>

<p>To send an email to a list, simply send it to the submission address.
To subscribe to a list to be able to read incoming mails as they arrive,
or to unsubscribe from a list, use the control request
address (<a href="#subunsub">see below</a>).

<p>The current list of available mailing lists is at
<url "http://lists.debian.org/">, presented sorted by topic
and unsorted.</p>

<p>All emails sent to the lists are distributed both to the list subscribers
and copied to the <a href="http://lists.debian.org/">public archive</a>,
for people to browse or <a href="http://lists.debian.org/search.html">search</a>
without the need to be subscribed. The mailing lists are public forums --
Debian provides a <a href="disclaimer">disclaimer of responsibility</a>.</p>

<p>We also maintain some <a href="http://lists.debian.org/stats/">usage
statistics</a> for the mailing lists: check the average number of posts
before subscribing to a list in order to avoid being flooded by mails.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="subunsub">Subscription / Unsubscription</toc-add-entry>

<p>Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open'.

<p>You can use simple web forms to subscribe or unsubscribe from
individual mailing lists, available at their respective web pages at
<url "http://lists.debian.org/">.</p>

<p>To subscribe or unsubscribe from multiple mailing lists at once,
use the list <a href="subscribe">subscription</a> or
<a href="unsubscribe">unsubscription</a> web forms, respectively.
The former page also includes descriptions and the subscription policy
for each list.</p>

<p>The requests for subscription or unsubscription can also be sent by
email, to a special control address, which is slightly different from the
lists address. <strong>Subscription or unsubscription messages should NOT be
sent to the address of the mailing list itself.</strong>

<p>To subscribe to or unsubscribe from a mailing list, please send mail to

<p><var>&lt;listname&gt;</var>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

<p>with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as Subject.

<p><strong>Please remember the -REQUEST part of the address.</strong>

<p>As part of the subscription process, the list software will send you an
email to which you must reply in order to finish subscribing. This is a
security measure to keep people from subscribing others to the lists without
their permission.

<p><a name="subglitches">
Please remember that <strong>an unsubscription request should be sent
from the address that is subscribed</strong>.</a> If that is not possible,
the Subject: header should be:
<code>unsubscribe <var>subscribedaddress@subscribed.domain</var></code></p>

<p>Unfortunately it's currently impossible to subscribe with a username
that matches procmail's check for mail coming from a daemon. This means
that a username may not have "mail", "admin", "root", "master" or similar
strings in it (see <kbd>procmailrc(5)</kbd> for "FROM_DAEMON").</p>

<p>Another known limitation in our mailing list software is that most
rejected e-mails get silently dropped, so the user has no real indication
on what went wrong. For example, it is common for people to try to subscribe
an address that is already subscribed: SmartList will simply ignore their
e-mail.</p>

<p>If you are uncertain as to whether you are subscribed to a mailing
list of ours, send mail to <email majordomo@lists.debian.org> with
<kbd>which <var>your.email@address</var></kbd> in the body. Further
information about this service (the so-called "MajorSmart") is available
by sending another mail to the same address with <kbd>help</kbd> in the
body.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="codeofconduct">Code of conduct</toc-add-entry>

<p>When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not send <em><a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=spam">
      spam</a></em>; see the <a href="#ads">advertising policy</a> below.
  <li>Send all of your e-mails in English. Only use other languages on
      mailing lists where that is explicitly allowed
      (e.g. French on debian-user-french).
  <li>Make sure that you are using the proper list. In particular, don't
      send user-related questions to developer-related mailing lists.
  <li>Wrap your lines at 80 characters or less for ordinary
      discussion. Lines longer than 80 characters are acceptable
      for computer-generated output (e.g., <kbd>ls -l</kbd>).
  <li>Do not send automated "out-of-office" or "vacation" messages.
  <li>Do not send subscription or unsubscription requests to the list
      address itself; use the respective <tt>-request</tt> address instead.
  <li>Never send your messages in HTML; use plain text instead.
  <li>Avoid sending large attachments.
  <li>When replying to messages on the mailing list, do not send a carbon
      copy (CC) to the original poster unless they explicitly request to be
      copied.
  <li>If you send messages to lists to which you are not subscribed, always
      note that fact in the body of your message.
  <li>Do not use foul language; besides, some people receive the lists
      via packet radio, where swearing is illegal.
  <li>Try not to <em><a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=flame">
      flame</a></em>; it is not polite.
</ul>

<p>If you're having problems subscribing or unsubscribing, please
make sure you've <a href="#subunsub">followed the proper procedure</a>
<strong>before</strong> trying to contact us. Make sure that you have seen
<a href="#subglitches">the caveats regarding subscription/unsubscription</a>.
</p>

<p>To contact the list maintainer, send e-mail <strong>in English</strong>
to <email "listmaster@lists.debian.org">.

<p>If you were unable to unsubscribe from a mailing list, please include a
copy of all the headers of an example message that you have received from
that list in your e-mail.</p>


<toc-add-entry name="ads">Debian mailing list advertising policy</toc-add-entry>

<p>This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".

<p>The Debian mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment. The
fee for advertisments is a donation of USD 1000 or more to
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/donations">"Software in the Public Interest"
(SPI)</a>. One donation per advertisement, please. If you prefer to pay in
arrears, simply post your advertisement to the list, and the list operator
will bill you USD 1999. The list operator will donate this amount, minus
the expense of collecting it, to SPI. Please note that the lists are
distributed automatically &mdash; messages are generally not read or checked
in any way before they are distributed.

<p>The act of posting an advertisement indicates your willingness to
<ul>
  <li>accept responsibility for the fee,
  <li>indemnify the list operator against any legal claims from you or
      others in connection with your advertisement, and
  <li>pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
</ul>
Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your
message.

<p>Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the list operator in advance of posting
for any reduction or fee waiver.
