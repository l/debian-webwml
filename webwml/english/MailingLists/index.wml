#use wml::debian::template title="Mailing Lists"

<P>Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all around
the world. Therefore e-mail is a preferred way to discuss various items.
Much of the the conversation between Debian developers and users is managed
through several
<a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=mailing+list">mailing
lists</a>.

<P>There are several world-open mailing lists while there are also some
lists which are only open to active developers. Please don't interpret this
as closed development, everyone is encouraged to help development of Debian
and to spread the word of free software. On the other hand it doesn't make
much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.

<P>All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server with a mail
transport agent that is optimized for lists, called Smartlist. This server
is called <code>lists.debian.org</code>. All submission, subscription and
unsubscription messages have to go to a particular address at this host.

<P>The language used on all lists is English, unless stated otherwise.
There are also some user lists for other languages available.

<h2><a name="subunsub">Subscription / Unsubscription</a></h2>

<p>Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open' (see below
for details on which lists are open).

<p><strong>*NO*</strong> subscription or unsubscription messages should be
sent to the address of the mailing list itself, but to a special control
address, which is slightly different from the lists address. To subscribe
or unsubscribe to a mailing list, please send mail to

<p><var>&lt;listname&gt;</var>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

<p>with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as Subject.

<p><strong>Please remember the -REQUEST part of the name.</strong>

<p>Alternatively, you can use simple web forms to <a href="subscribe">
subscribe</a> or to <a href="unsubscribe">unsubscribe</a> from the lists.

<p>As part of the subscription process you will be sent mail which you must
reply to to finish subscribing. This is a security measure to keep people
from subscribing others to the lists without their permission.

<h2>Mailing list archives</h2>

<P>You can also view (and search for) old posts to the mailing lists using
the <A HREF="http://lists.debian.org/">mailing list archives</A>. Some
mailing list <a href="http://lists.debian.org/stats/">usage statistics</a>
are also available.

<h2>List maintenance</h2>

<P>If you wish to request a new mailing list, please read the
<A HREF="HOWTO_start_list">HOWTO</A>.

<p>To contact the list maintainer, send e-mail to
<A HREF="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org">listmaster@lists.debian.org</A>
or <A HREF="../Bugs/Reporting">file a bug report</A> against the
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/lists.debian.org">lists.debian.org</A>
pseudo-package.

<h2><a name="ads">Debian mailing list advertising policy</a></h2>

<p>This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".

<p>The Debian mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment. The
fee for advertisments is a donation of USD 1000 or more to
<a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/donations">"Software in the Public Interest"
(SPI)</a>. One donation per advertisement, please. If you prefer to pay in
arrears, simply post your advertisement to the list, and the list operator
will bill you USD 1999. The list operator will donate this amount, minus
the expense of collecting it, to SPI. Please note that the lists are
distributed automatically &mdash; messages are generally not read or checked
in any way before they are distributed.

<p>The act of posting an advertisement indicates your willingness to
<ul>
  <li>accept responsibility for the fee,
  <li>indemnify the list operator against any legal claims from you or
      others in connection with your advertisement, and
  <li>pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
</ul>
Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your
message.

<p>Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the list operator in advance of posting
for any reduction or fee waiver.
