<H1>Mailing-List Subscription</H1>

Our lists are served by Smartlist.  This is a comfortable, easy
way to manage them.  If the subscription policy for the
particular list is `open' everyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe
on their own.                                                        
                                                                        
<P>*NO* subscription or unsubscription messages should be sent to the
lists address. They should only to a special control address which
is slightly different from the lists address.  To subscribe or
unsubscribe to such a list, please send a mail to

<P>&lt;listname&gt;-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

<P>with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.              
Please remember the -REQUEST inside of the name.

<P>A much easier way is to simply use our subscribe and unsubscribe
forms. The subscription form is below. The unsubscribe form is on a separate page.

<P>This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".

       
<P>The Debian Linux mailing lists accept commercial advertising for
  payment.  We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the canceled
  check for a $1000 (U.S.) or more donation to the Free Software
  Foundation earmarked for "Debian".  One donation per advertisement,
  please.  If you don't wish to donate, simply post your advertisement
  to the list, and the operator of the mailing lists will bill you $1999
  (U.S).  The list operator will donate this amount, minus the expense
  of collecting it, to FSF.  Please note that the lists are distributed
  automatically - messages are generally not read or checked in any way
  before they are distributed.

       
<P>By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept
  responsibility for the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list
  operator against any legal claims from you or others in connection
  with your advertisement, and you agree to pay any legal and business
  expenses incurred in collecting late payment. Our liability to you
  is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.

  advertisements. You must consult the mailing-list operator in
  advance of posting for any reduction or fee waiver.
