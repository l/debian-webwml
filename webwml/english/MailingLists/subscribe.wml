<h1>Introduction to the Debian mailing lists</h1>
  Most of the the conversation between Debian developers and users is
  managed through several mailing lists.  Debian GNU/Linux is
  developed through distributed development all around the world.
  Therefore email is the preferred way to discuss various items.
  <p>
  There are several world-open mailing lists while there are also some
  lists which are only open to active developers.  Please don't
  interpret this as closed development, everyone is encouraged to help
  development of debian and to spread the word of free software.
  On the other hand it doesn't make much sense discussing internal
  topics with non-developers.
  <p>
  All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server with a
  mail transport agent that is optimized for lists.  This host is
  called lists.debian.org.  All submission, subscription and
  unsubscription messages have to go to this host.
  <p>
  The language used on all lists is English unless stated otherwise.
  There are some user lists for other languages available.

<h2>Subscription / Unsubscription</h2>

  Our lists are served by Smartlist.  This results in a comfortable
  way to manage them.  If the subscription policy for a
  particular list is `open' anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe
  on their own.
  <p>
  *NO* subscription or unsubscription messages should be sent to the
  lists address, but to a special control address which is
  slightly different from the lists address.  To subscribe or
  unsubscribe to such a list, please send mail to
  <p>
  &lt;listname&gt;-REQUEST@lists.debian.org
  <p>
  with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.
  <p>
  Please remember the -REQUEST inside of the name.
  <p>
  If you need to contact a human listmaster, direct your mail to
  <a href="mailto:listmaster@debian.org">listmaster@debian.org</a> or <a href="mailto:listmaster@va.debian.org">listmaster@va.debian.org</a> .  These are two
  different machines in case one is offline.  To find out who
  is responsible for the lists, take a look at
  <a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/maintainer_contacts.html">http://www.debian.org/devel/maintainer_contacts.html</a> .

<hr><h2>Mailing list advertising policy</h2>

  This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".
  <p>
  The Debian Linux mailing lists accept commercial advertising for
  payment.  We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the canceled
  check for a $1000 (U.S.) or more donation to "Software in the Public
  Interest" (SPI).  One donation per advertisement, please.  If you
  don't wish to donate, simply post your advertisement to the list,
  and the operator of the mailing lists will bill you $1999 (U.S).  The
  list operator will donate this amount, minus the expense of
  collecting it, to SPI.  Please note that the lists are distributed
  automatically - messages are generally not read or checked in any way
  before they are distributed.
  <p>
  By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept
  responsibility for the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list
  operator against any legal claims from you or others in connection
  with your advertisement, and you agree to pay any legal and business
  expenses incurred in collecting late payment. Our liability to you
  is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.
  <p>
  Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
  advertisements. You must consult the mailing-list operator in
  advance of posting for any reduction or fee waiver.
