MailingLists/subscribe.wml and MailingLists/unsubscribe.wml
are generated automatically from scripts. Do not bother
translating these yet. A system for adding translations
will be developed.

The problem is that the list of mailing lists (along with
the descriptions) are managed by different people.
We don't have cvs access to modify them.

This is not a problem of itself, but lists are created
fairly often and translations will quickly be behind
if we don't devise a system to make sure that lists are
available to all pages even if a translation falls behind.
