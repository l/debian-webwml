Debian mailing list advertising policy
This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".
.
The Debian mailing lists accept commercial advertising for payment. The fee
for advertisments is a donation of USD 1000 or more to "Software in the
Public Interest" (SPI).  One donation per advertisement, please.  If you
prefer to pay in arrears, simply post your advertisement to the list, and
the list operator will bill you USD 1999.  The list operator will donate
this amount, minus the expense of collecting it, to SPI.  Please note that
the lists are distributed automatically -- messages are generally not read
or checked in any way before they are distributed.
.
The act of posting an advertisement indicates your willingness to
  * accept responsibility for the fee,
  * indemnify the list operator against any legal claims from you or
      others in connection with your advertisement, and
  * pay any legal and business expenses incurred in collecting late payment.
Our liability to you is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your
message.
.
Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the list operator in advance of posting for
any reduction or fee waiver.
