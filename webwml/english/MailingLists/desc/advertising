Mailing list advertising policy
This policy is intended to fight mailing-list "spamming".
.
The Debian Linux mailing lists accept commercial advertising for
payment.  We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the canceled
check for a $1000 (U.S.) or more donation to "Software in the Public
Interest" (SPI).  One donation per advertisement, please.  If you
don't wish to donate, simply post your advertisement to the list,
and the operator of the mailing lists will bill you $1999 (U.S).  The
list operator will donate this amount, minus the expense of
collecting it, to SPI.  Please note that the lists are distributed
automatically - messages are generally not read or checked in any way
before they are distributed.
.
By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept
responsibility for the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list
operator against any legal claims from you or others in connection
with your advertisement, and you agree to pay any legal and business
expenses incurred in collecting late payment. Our liability to you
is limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.
.
Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the mailing-list operator in
advance of posting for any reduction or fee waiver.
