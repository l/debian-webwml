Discussions about the needs of companies that contribute to, offer
support for, or have other strategic interests in Debian.
.
List participation is restricted to representatives of companies that
offer Debian-specific support or services and that are determined to
contribute to Debian.
.
As an approximation of the above, subscription requests will be
verified against the following criteria:
.
- the requested subscription address should be a company address
(i.e. its domain name should correspond to a company website)
.
- the company should advertise on its website Debian-related support
or services, mentioning the Debian name or logo, and linking back to
the Debian website (please provide a link to that page in your
subscription request)
.
- at least 2 Debian project members (AKA Debian Developer) should be
working for the company (please name them in your request)
.
- preferably, the person requesting subscription should be able to
speak as a company representative, at least for the topics of
interest of the mailing list
.
List participation can be requested by a mail to listmaster@debian.org. The
mail has to include all needed information and has to be signed by a debian
developer with a key in the debian keyring.
