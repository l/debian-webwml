Job postings can be published on this list in
order to make them public to members of the Debian
community.  While the jobs do not necessarily have
to involve the use Debian, it is encouraged that
they do.  Jobs can be about the development of
proprietary system, but jobs involving free software
(either development or system administration) are
preferred.  Please include information such as
location and remuneration if appropriate.  The list
is moderated; it is also an open list - job postings
which have to be kept private should be sent to
leader@debian.org who will distribute them.
