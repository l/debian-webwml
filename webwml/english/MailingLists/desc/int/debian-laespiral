Advocacy of Debian amongst spanish-speakers,
a project dedicated to promote the
use of Debian's distribution working
on articles (http://laespiral.org/),
internationalisation CD-ROMs, installation
parties and new programs for Spanish users (see
http://www.debian.org/international/spanish/).
.
The project was started in June 2000 by Debian
GNU/Linux Spanish users.  Their aim is to make
publicity of Debian on the Spanish-speakers world,
and promote the distribution of Debian CDs along
with Linux magazines.
.
Becoming a member of La Espiral is for people
that do not find themselves able to contribute
technically to Debian (at first), but might be a
good step towards becoming a Debian developer.
