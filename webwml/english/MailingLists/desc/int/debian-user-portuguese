This list is used to give Portuguese-speaking users of Debian sub-projects
(not only GNU/Linux) a forum to to some work together, ranging from
internationalization to advocacy (ala debian-publicity) to translation
of the website to user support (ala debian-user) and even the occasional
project-internal flamewar (ala debian-devel).
