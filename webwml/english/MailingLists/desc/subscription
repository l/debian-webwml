Subscription / Unsubscription
Our lists are served by Smartlist.  This results in a comfortable
way to manage them.  If the subscription policy for a
particular list is `open' anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe
on their own.
.
*NO* subscription or unsubscription messages should be sent to the
lists address, but to a special control address which is
slightly different from the lists address.  To subscribe or
unsubscribe to such a list, please send mail to
.
      <listname>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org
.
with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.
.
Please remember the -REQUEST inside of the name.
.
If you need to contact a human listmaster, direct your mail to
listmaster@debian.org or listmaster@va.debian.org .  These are two
different machines in case one is offline.  To find out who
is responsible for the lists, take a look at
http://www.debian.org/intro/organization .
