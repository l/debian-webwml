Subscription / Unsubscription
Anyone is able to subscribe/unsubscribe on their own to any mailing list,
presuming the subscription policy for a particular list is `open'.
.
The requests for subscription or unsubscription can be sent to a special
control address, which is slightly different from the list address.
Subscription or unsubscription messages should NOT be sent to the address
of the mailing list itself.
.
To subscribe or unsubscribe from a mailing list, please send mail to
.
      <listname>-REQUEST@lists.debian.org
.
with the word `subscribe' or `unsubscribe' as subject.
.
Please remember the -REQUEST part of the address.
.
As part of the subscription process, the list software will send you an
email to which you must reply in order to finish subscribing.  This is a
security measure to keep people from subscribing others to the lists without
their permission.
.
If you need to contact a human listmaster, direct your mail to
listmaster@lists.debian.org . To find out who is responsible for the
lists, take a look at https://www.debian.org/intro/organization
