Introduction to the Debian mailing lists
Most of the the conversation between Debian developers and users is
managed through several mailing lists.  Debian GNU/Linux is
developed through distributed development all around the world.
Therefore email is the preferred way to discuss various items.
.
There are several world-open mailing lists while there are also some
lists which are only open to active developers.  Please don't
interpret this as closed development, everyone is encouraged to help
development of debian and to spread the word of free software.
On the other hand it doesn't make much sense discussing internal
topics with non-developers.
.
All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server with a
mail transport agent that is optimized for lists.  This host is
called lists.debian.org.  All submission, subscription and
unsubscription messages have to go to this host.
.
The language used on all lists is English unless stated otherwise.
There are some user lists for other languages available.
