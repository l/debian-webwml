Introduction to the Debian mailing lists
Debian GNU/Linux is developed through distributed development all
around the world. Therefore, email is the preferred way to discuss
various items. Much of the conversation between Debian developers
and users is managed through several mailing lists.  
.
There are many world-open mailing lists, meaning anyone can read
everything that is posted, and participate in the discussions. Everyone is
encouraged to help development of Debian and to spread the word of free
software.  There are also a few lists which are only open to official Debian
developers; please don't interpret this as closed development, it sometimes
doesn't make much sense discussing internal topics with non-developers.
.
All original Debian mailing lists run on a special server, using an
automatic mail processing software called SmartList.  This server is called
lists.debian.org.  All submission, subscription and unsubscription messages
have to be sent to a particular address at this host.
.
The language used on all lists is English, unless stated otherwise.
There are some user lists for other languages available.
