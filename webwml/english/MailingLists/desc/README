                 README for webwml/english/MailingLists/desc

You can make translated copies of all files in this directory, except for
the files "advertising", "introduction" and "subscription". These three
files are only used for the creation of the mailing-lists.txt file, and that
is not to be translated.

Caution: Since the lists description can be used in a text file, too, it
should not be wider than 52 characters. (In case anyone wants to make
mailing-lists.??.txt...)
