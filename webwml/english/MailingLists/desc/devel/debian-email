The intention of this list is to act as a grab-bag
for Debian related correspondence such as contacting
upstream authors about licenses, bugs etc. or discussing
the project with others where it might be useful to have
the discussion archived somewhere. . This is archived
on the development machine and only developers have
access to it.
