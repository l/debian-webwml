This list covers developer-to-developer issues. It is
the main communication media for all developers. It's
only supposed to be used for politically or technically
sensitive discussions. Anything sent there should be
treated as sensitive and not to be spread to other
lists; thus cross-posting between it and an open list
defeats the purpose of the list.
