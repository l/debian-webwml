This list covers developer-to-developer issues. It is the main
communication media for all developers. It's only supposed to be used
for politically or technically sensitive discussions. Anything sent there
should be treated as sensitive and not to be spread to other lists; thus
cross-posting between it and an open list defeats the purpose of the list.
