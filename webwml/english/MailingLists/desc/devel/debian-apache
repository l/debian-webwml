This mailing list is for people who are interested
in the maintenance of the Apache (web server) and
related packages for Debian.  It is neither for
submitting bug reports (please use the BTS for that),
nor for support requests.  It is intended to
facilitate the coordination of this effort (code
changes, reproducing bugs, talking to upstream etc.).
