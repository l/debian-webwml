This list is for people who are interested in the
maintenance of the openssh packages for Debian.
It is *not* the place to mail bug reports
(use the BTS for that), nor support requests.
It exists to facilitate coordination of ssh
maintenance (talking to upstream, reproducing bugs,
hacking on the code, etc.).
