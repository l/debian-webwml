Debian Pure Blends (formerly known as Custom Debian Distributions)
provide support for special user interests. They implement a new
approach to cover interests of specialised users, who might be 
children, lawyers, medical staff, visually impaired people, etc.
Of late, several Debian Pure Blends have evolved. The common goal 
of those is to make installation and administration of computers 
for their target users as easy as possible, and to serve in the
role as the missing link between software developers and users
well.
