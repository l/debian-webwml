<h1>Viridian Sun</h1>

<p>We have our own dedicated helpdesk team and field engineers, and offer 
tailor made support and maintenance contracts and run many debian boxes 
ourselves and for our customers.
We are able to help with anything from setting up internet mail servers and 
office machines to building private ADSL WAN's, VoIP networks and intranets.
We also build corporate information systems and supply hardware which we can 
pre-load in volume, and install.
