$200/hour, minimum one hour. I donate 25% of my fees to Software
in the Public Interest, the parent organization of the Debian
project. I wrote a good deal of the bootstrap and installation
system, and the scripts that create the official CDs. You might
find my services useful in creating custom CD distributions
derived from Debian, packaging commercial software for use on
Debian, and writing device drivers. I work in computer graphics
at Pixar, creator of "Toy Story". I also have experience in
writing software for Amateur Radio, and hold an Amateur Extra
class license with callsign K6BP.
