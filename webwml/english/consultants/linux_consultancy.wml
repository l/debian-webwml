Whether you just want someone to help you sort out a Linux system, or
whether you are looking for someone to supply and maintain a Linux
server, we can help. One of our offerings is an "Office Server", which
handles all email (including spam and virus detection), file storage,
automated off-site backups, internal web pages and more.
