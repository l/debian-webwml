<p>
We donate 10 EUR/h for the Debian project based on the
short term price. If it is a long running project the rates will go
down considerably but we will spend 5 EUR/h nevertheless.
</p>
<p>
Our main strengths are compiler and language development. We do offer
a C development environment on Linux
(http://www.q-software-solutions.de/products/qide/).
</p>
<p>
We have developed a C compiler for 32 and 64 bit systems.
</p>
<p>
All our servers are running under Debian, as well as our personal PCs.
</p>
<p>
We've also published a few articles in the German 'Linux Magazin'
its english counterpart and also the German 'freeX' magazine.
