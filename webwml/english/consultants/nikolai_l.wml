<PRE>
I am a student at the University of Queensland
doing a Bachelors Degree in Information
Technology and a Bachelors Degree in Arts with
a double major in History. I specialise in
setting and administering unix machines, from
a single machine to entire networks. For home
or office, I will accomodate your needs in the
most effective manor, including interfaceing 
unix servers with Windows 95/NT desktops.
