I am an computer systems engineering student who uses Debian
as a drop in replacement for NT.  My main market is medium sized
businesses with 5+ computers and who need to have networks,
intranets and document management systems.  I am currently
developing a clone of MYOB under postgres95sql and tcl/tk plugin
| java & HTML.
