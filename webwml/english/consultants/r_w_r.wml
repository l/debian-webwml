<p>
We are a one-stop shop serving everyone from individuals to large
corporations, with help ranging from setting up home based systems to web
site hosting and creation to small business networks and writing custom
applications. We started working with Slackware in the mid-90's and
graduated to Debian soon thereafter. We can cover all versions of Linux,
Windows, Mac's and specialize in integrated networks containing all of
them (we'll even throw in a Novell server if you twist our arms and pay
lots of money). If we can't do it, we know someone who can and will refer
you to them (no referral fee).
