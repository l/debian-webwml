<PRE>
We started Southern Gazer because we saw too many small businesses
being dragged down by computer headaches and over the top costs.

Our background is many years in PC utility technical support so we
know how to get your systems up and running quickly and keep them that
way. What's more - we can explain even the most technical issues in
simply, clear English. We work on the basis that we probably can't do
your job, so we don't expect you to be able to do ours. We won't treat
you like an idiot simply because you have a computer problem!

We've been using Linux since the middle 90's and have found it to be a
fantastic all purpose tool.

Where appropriate we offer Open Source solutions for your business
computing needs because of its stability, security and the enormous
cost savings on offer.

Our services range from Linux based Samba server installation, E-mail
systems, Webservers, Content Management Systems (CMS), Intranets,
Firewalls and desktop environments.

We've installed Red Hat, Debian, e-smith and FreeBSD systems. We also
offer competitively priced E-mail and Webhosting and sell a complete
range of Linux, Open Source and FreeBSD CD's from our Website.

Southern Gazer is based in the Sutherland Shire in Sydney but has
clients all over the Sydney Metropolitan area.

Competitive hourly rates. No call out fees.

We can install and configure on-site a complete Linux based Windows NT
or Windows 2000 Server replacement on your hardware starting from $199
(inc GST) with no further user or per seat costs. See our website for
further details.
