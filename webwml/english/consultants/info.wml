<h2>Policy for Debian's consultants page</h2>

<p>If you want to be listed as a consultant at the Debian web site,
the most important ideas you should understand are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mandatory contact information<br />
    You must provide a working e-mail address and answer e-mails sent to you
    within four weeks at most. You are not allowed to use your official
    @debian.org address, as required by the
    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Further contact information<br />
    If you'd like to provide a URL, please note that you cannot use an
    official *.debian.org domain, according to the
    <a href="$(HOME)/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.
  </li>
  <li>Multiple cities/regions/countries<br />
    Every consultant has to choose in what country (only one) they want
    to be listed. They can choose only one address to be mentioned, but
    they can of course mention additional cities, regions or countries on
    their additional info or on their website.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Only the consultants who satisfy the above criteria will be listed.
If the above criteria are no longer met at some future point, the consultant
should receive a warning message that they are about to be removed from the
listing, unless they fulfill all criteria again. There should be a grace
period of four weeks.</p>

<p>Some parts (or all) of the consultant's information can be removed if
they don't comply with this policy anymore or at the maintainers'
discretion.</p>
