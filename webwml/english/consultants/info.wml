<h2>Policy for Debian's consultants page</h2>

<p>If you want to be listed as a consultant at the Debian web site,
the please note the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mandatory contact information<br />
    You must provide a working e-mail address and answer e-mails sent to you
    within four weeks at most.
  </li>
  <li>Multiple cities/regions/countries<br />
    You have to choose the country (only one) that you want to be
    listed under. Additional cities, regions or countries should be
    listed either as part of the additional info, or at your own website.
  </li>
  <li>Rules for Debian developers<br />
    You are not allowed to use your official @debian.org address
    for the consultant listing.<br />
    If you'd like to provide a URL, you cannot use an official
    *.debian.org domain.<br />
    This is required by the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If the above criteria are no longer met at some future point, the
consultant should receive a warning message that they are about to be
removed from the list, unless they fulfill all criteria again.
There should be a grace period of four weeks.</p>
