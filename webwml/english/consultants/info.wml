<h2>Policy for Debian's consultants page</h2>

<p>If you want to be listed as a consultant at the Debian web site,
the please note the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mandatory contact information<br />
    You must provide a working e-mail address and answer e-mails sent to you
    within four weeks at most.
  </li>
  <li>Multiple cities/regions/countries<br />
    Every consultant has to choose in what country (only one) they want
    to be listed. They can choose only one address to be mentioned, but
    they can of course mention additional cities, regions or countries on
    their additional info or on their website.
  </li>
  <li>Rules for Debian developers<br />
    You are not allowed to use your official @debian.org address
    for the consultant listing.<br />
    If you'd like to provide a URL, you cannot use an official
    *.debian.org domain.<br />
    This is required by the <a href="$(HOME)/devel/dmup">DMUP</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Only the consultants who satisfy the above criteria will be listed.
If the above criteria are no longer met at some future point, the consultant
should receive a warning message that they are about to be removed from the
listing, unless they fulfill all criteria again. There should be a grace
period of four weeks.</p>

<p>Some parts (or all) of the consultant's information can be removed if
they don't comply with this policy anymore or at the maintainers'
discretion.</p>
