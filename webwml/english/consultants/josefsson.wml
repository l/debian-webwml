<p>
We develop and maintain free security and internationalization
libraries, such as Shishi, GNU SASL, GnuTLS, Generic Security
Service, LibIDN, Libntlm, Libtasn1.  We provide support, porting, and
extensions of our products, but we also work with security analysis
and technical specification work.  We have a F-tax clearance
certificate (<q>F-skattebevis</q>).
