<p>
We are a management consultancy specialising
in helping organisations make the most of information and communication
technology. Where appropriate, we deploy Debian GNU/Linux (the only
Linux distribution, we support) alongside Windows and Mac OS X and support
the integrated systems. We favor gradual migration to Debian and
typically clients start with a Debian based file and print server;
thereafter we add additional functionality such as an IMAP mail server
and web-based (intranet) applications such as databases using
PostgreSQL (or MySQL).
