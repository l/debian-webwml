Starnix is a technology firm founded in 1998, with a focus on Linux and
Open Source. From teaching revision control software courses at Research
in Motion to video card driver development for AMD/ATI, Starnix has a
proven track record of delivering exceptional service and cost savings
by leveraging Open Source technologies.

<p>
Such savings extend to their product line, a suite of Linux-based
servers including Firewall/VPN, database, network-attached storage,
backup and thin clients. These products are supported and maintained by
Starnix's managed services.
</p>

Starnix continues to significantly lower IT costs for businesses while
at the same time enhancing systems security and flexibility. Many of
North America’s industry leaders such as Clover Leaf Seafoods, Expedia,
Indigo Books and Konica Minolta have realized the benefits of Open
Source technologies by taking advantage of Starnix’s products and
services throughout the company’s 14-year history.
