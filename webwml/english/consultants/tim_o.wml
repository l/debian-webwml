Additional Information: OASys specializes in serving the small to medium
size business community in all their computing needs. We recommend the
Debian Linux and Samba combination over Windows NT Server due to Debian's
stability, robust operation, and absence of licensing headaches. In
addition, we service most Unix variants as well as Windows 95, 98, and NT. 

OASys also offers training and basic administration classes upon
request/special arrangement.
