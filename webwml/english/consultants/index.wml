<P> Debian is free software and offers free help through
<A HREF="../MailingLists/">mailing lists</A>.  Some people either don't
have the time or have specialized needs and are willing to hire someone to
either maintain or add additional functionality to their Debian system.  The
following is a list of people who make at least part of their income from doing
<STRONG>paid</STRONG> support for Debian.

<P> Names are sorted by country, but within each country are simply listed in
the order received. If your country is not listed, please check any neighboring
countries, as some of the consultants will work internationally.  Debian lists
the consultants simply as a courtesy to its users and does not endorse any of
the people or companies listed below.  Please see <a href="#add-update">the
bottom of this page</a> for information on how to add or update a listing.

<P> Please note that some consultants donate a portion of their income (derived
from Debian) to supporting Debian.  This is up to each consultant or company.
Of course, this is pointed out to you so that it will hopefully influence your
choice...
