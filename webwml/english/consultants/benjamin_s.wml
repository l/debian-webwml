I will donate 10% of the profits to Debian of any work I obtain through
the web page. 

I have experience with installation and configuration of Debian
including web, DNS, etc., WAN setup and configuration (remote access,
data replication, etc), and I have programming experience with Mysql/PHP
and other tools.  Also, I have experience in integrating Internet
connectivity with the current network to get the most value out of the
Internet connection.
