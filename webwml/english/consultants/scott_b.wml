<PRE>
We do everything, from vanilla installs, to specific customizations and hacks,
to ongoing system administration. However, we do not do telephone-only
support.  Also, since we are a very small company (for the moment), we will
not return long-distance phone calls, unless they are toll-free.

Currently, our prices are $20/hour for personal clients, and $40/hour for
commercial clients.
