<p>
Non-government organisations (NGOs) involved in community interest,
human rights, environment and social justice issues need communication
systems which are appropriate to their needs. Debian Linux provides
secure, inexpensive, expandable solutions that run well on minimal
hardware requirements. Minihub also provides corporate consulting, and
does work all over South East Asia.
