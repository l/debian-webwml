#use wml::debian::consultant name="Andreas John"

<p>
Specialized in networking I am able to help companies with Debian things
related to networking (layer 2, vlan, bridging, bonding, failover),
management of webserver farms (cluster, loadbalancer, ldap, virtualisation)
and backbones (bgp, ospf, quagga, zebra, etc.).

I am only available for opensource-based projects or training.
