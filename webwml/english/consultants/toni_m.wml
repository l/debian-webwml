#use wml::debian::consultant name="Oeko.neT"

<p>
Toni holds a University degree in computer science (Dipl.-Inf.)
and has been active as a consultant since about 1985, and operated
an ISP since 1994. Customers as large as PLCs enjoy projects
that are functional, on time and on budget, too.
</p><p>
He tends to specify, design and implement in the direction of
a robust, scalable, and secure solution that can handle the
anticipated load if the client permits, maybe owing to his
ISP background there. 
</p><p>
During all the work, he strongly emphasizes free software, if
somehow feasible. Available for tasks in other countries as well, 
depending on the specifics. We offer Debian housing &amp; hosting, both
managed and unmanaged.
