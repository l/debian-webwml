Rates will be determined by the type of problem and time
expected/involved.  I am a 3 year linux administrator with 2 years
maintaining multiple Debian servers.  Specialties include workstation
configurations and router/proxy systems.  I have a great deal of
experience with incorporating Debian (or any other linux - some other
unixen too) into the workplace. At this time, I am willing to
provide e-mail support and local support only.
Following the trend - a portion of all proceeds will be donated to
Debian - The OS of the Deities (and Deity users).
