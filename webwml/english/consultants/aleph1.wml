<h1>Aleph One Ltd</h1>

<p>
We specialise in Embedded/Small systems and the ARM architecture, but most
of this expertise gneralises to embedded systems in general. We can
also advise on Debian-based small office systems. We can provide general
consultancy on your project, help with ports to your hardware, write 
device drivers, educate your engineers/management on the GNU/Linux 
development process and licencing, or build filesystem images for you.
We are flexible and friendly, and take some pride in offering high-quality
advice.
