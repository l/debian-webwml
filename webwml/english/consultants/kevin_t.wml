I have 10 years experience with Unix (7 with Debian GNU/Linux) specializing
in operating system administration, network security, disaster recovery, and
task automation.  I also have 5+ years of experience in web application
development and support services using PHP/Perl, Javascript/CSS (DHTML),
PostgreSQL/MySQL, Apache, or other open source applications as required.

Please mention that you found me on debian.org and I will donate 10% of your
fee back to the Debian project.
