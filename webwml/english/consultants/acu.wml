(KVM) Servers, Web Servers, Course Management Servers (EDXcode and
Moodle), and Bioinformatics (e.g. Whole Genome Analysis).
Debian GNU/Linux is our mainline OS (since 10 years), however, we
provide support for other Linux distributions such as  
RedHat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, Scientific Linux.
We have physical locations in Chicago Area and Minnesota, but
we do remote or fly anywhere in US or world to setup servers or for
tech support.
