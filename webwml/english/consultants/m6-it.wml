M6-IT is a social enterprise supporting software freedom and
sustainable IT for third sector organisations, and education projects.
We work directly in a number of communities to heal the digital divide,
and provide training, support, and web-based solutions to a variety of
organisations.

<p>
With bases in Manchester, Oxford, Birmingham, and Wales, we cover most
of the western half of the British Isles - and occasionally work further
afield, particularly on web-based tasks.
