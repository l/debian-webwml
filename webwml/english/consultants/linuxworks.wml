Our business is to make computers and internet technology work better
for you.  That is, to evaluate your computer use, listen to what you
want, and then come up with solutions that meet your needs.  They may be
easier to use, quicker, have more features, be more reliable and cost
less.

We produce debian based solutions, mainly for small orgainisations.  We
can replace or augment other systems, both on the desktop and in the
back office/ server room.  We can create a single component for a
specific task, but prefer to take a whole systems view because benefits
are greater when the whole picture is taken into account.

Our team includes experts in technologies such as Debian, Linux, exim,
sendmail, squid, apache, thttpd, samba, netatalk, c/c++, Java, python,
scripting, webware, mysql, postgres, gnome, legacy (windows) application
solutions and 802.11 wireless.  We're always learning new stuff, and
we'll pick up any open source technology that will benefit you.

You may want to take a hands-on approach to your systems and give us
detailed instructions on how you want things to look.  Alternatively,
you may want us leave it all to us to come up with a solution that "just
works".  We're happy to work with you whatever you want.

We look forward to your call.
