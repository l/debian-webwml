Incipit: the client in the center
Our approach is forthright: we try to understand the real needs of the
client and to provide an efficient solution, fastly and at low costs.

Incipit: complete services
We can provide computer services and networking solutions all-in-one:
we plan the solution, sell the product, implement the project, configure
all the machines, provide the training and support ponctually or under a
continuous contract.

Incipit: a single consultant
We think that a single technological consultant is an advantage for the
client. Only one name and one phone number for all the needs of computer,
networking and security solutions.
