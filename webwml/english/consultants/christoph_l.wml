<PRE>
PC Software and Unix Software development, design and support since I was
15 (1978). Master of Computer Science 1986 from the University of Bremen
in Germany. I have experience running Debian to serve large Campuses and
distributed Companies integrating heterogenous environments. Experience
integrating Debian with VAX/VMS, HP-UX, SCO, Solaris, Windows, Win95,
WinNT, MacIntosh and plain old Terminals. I have been running Debian for
WAN Connections, Bridging, Firewalls, Masquerading, Modem Pools and as a
File Server for both Macintosh and PC environments. I have experience
teaching others how to use Debian and have repeatedly pioneered the use of
Linux Servers as Internet Servers or Corporate Servers.
