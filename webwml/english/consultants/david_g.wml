<PRE>
Although technical support for Unix and Linux is not our primary
business, we do have the expertise and experience. We can provide
support for installation and system setup, networking, trouble shooting,
and custom programming.

For work we receive providing Debian technical support, we will donate
5% of our hourly rate to Debian (Software in the Public Interest).
