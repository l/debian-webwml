<p>
GPLHost delivers professional hosting facilities
with high availability and security, and is contributing to the open
source effort in building hosting tools. Our main software is available at
<a href="http://www.gplhost.com/software-dtc.html">\
http://www.gplhost.com/software-dtc.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
Some of our packages for doing hosting (like dtc, dtc-xen, sbox and
others) are already in Debian, and we believe that our contributions are a
real alternative to commercial solutions.
We can help for any hosting problems, but not only. We can also find
Debian solutions for companies (Debian for desktop uses, VPN, Samba domain
controllers, file servers, etc.).
