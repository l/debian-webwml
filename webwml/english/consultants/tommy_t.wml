OpenSys is one of the networking company in Hong Kong aimed to develop
leading internet technology and to provide consultancy service. Since
1999, we supply hardware and software products including pre-installed
Linux PC, LAN and WAN Peripherals especially on multicast enabled
network such as MBone Router. From many internet available Linux
solutions, OpenSys utilizes the widely accepted, powerful Debian Linux
as our development platform. It not only     shortens our product
delivery cycle, and also takes full advantage of the most up-to-date
andprofessional Debian Linux.

One of our products is an embedded system running with a minimal Debian
Linux files to allow routing of multicast data among MBone Islands.
Moreover, we are looking forward to connect to the real MBone in the
near future.
