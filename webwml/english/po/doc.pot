Start on the\n  beginners level and learn how to deploy the system with graphical\n  interface and terminal.\n  This book provides the basic knowledge to grow and become a 'junior'\n  systems administrator. Start off with exploring the GNOME desktop\n  interface and adjust it to your personal needs. Overcome your fear of\n  using the Linux terminal and learn the most essential commands in\n  administering Debian. Expand your knowledge of system services (systemd)\n  and learn how to adapt them. Get more out of the software in Debian and\n  outside of Debian.

The GNU\n  toolchain is covered in native and cross-compiler form, as are bootloaders,\n  kernel patches, RAMdisks, ARM peculiarities and other ARM resources. It also\n  includes extensive tutorial information on GNU/Linux basics for developers\n  coming from other platforms.\n  It is not specific to Debian, but the Aleph\n  ARMLinux distribution is closely based on Debian-ARM and it is assumed you\n  will be working from this distribution and preferably have a Debian based\n  host machine too."
