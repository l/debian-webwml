Q. What to do with those <lang>/po directories?
A. If you are not familiar with PO files, please read gettext
   documentation.
   Calling 'make' in */po/ directories (different than English) runs:
       msgmerge -q templates.<xx>.po ../../english/po/templates.pot |\
           msgfmt --use-fuzzy --statistics -o templates.mo -
   where <xx> is the language code.  If templates.mo file differs from
   webwml/locale/<xx>/LC_MESSAGES/templates.mo, then the latter is
   replaced by the former.

   When a translator wants to work on a PO file, he runs 'make update-po'
   which executes:
       msgmerge templates.<xx>.po ../../english/po/templates.pot \
              -o templates.<xx>.po.new && \
              mv templates.<xx>.po.new templates.<xx>.po

Q. What are those <void> tags in msgids?
A. They are meant to make msgids unique.  Sometimes the same English
   msgid may have different translations depending on context, so
   there must be distinguished; this is the purpose of the <void> tag,
   which does not appear in output.
   There is no reason to put it in msgstr, unless in a very special
   case, if you want an empty translated string.

Q. How do I know which files need to be updated?
A. Run 'make stats' to display nice statistics for your language.

Q. Why are HTML generated files not updated after editing templates.<xx>.po?
A. You have to run 'make' in your webwml/<lang>/po/ directory to update
   MO files.

Q. It doesn't work, what happens?
A. There may be several reasons, e.g.
   * mp4h >= 1.3.0 must be installed in order to display translated strings,
     make sure your version is recent enough
   * Your language must have been generated in /usr/lib/locale/<lang>/,
     otherwise gettext seems unable to display localized strings :(
