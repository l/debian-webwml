Q. What to do with those <lang>/po directories?
A. If you are not familiar with PO files, please read gettext
   documentation.  When running 'make' in english/po/ directory, templates.pot
   is generated.  This file contains all the translatable strings found in
   english/template/debian/*.wml files.

   Running 'make' in other */po/ directories gives:
       msgmerge -q templates.<xx>.po ../../english/po/templates.pot |\
           msgfmt --use-fuzzy --statistics -o templates.mo -
   where <xx> is the language code.  If templates.mo file differs from
   webwml/locale/<xx>/LC_MESSAGES/templates.mo, then the latter is
   replaced by the former.

   When a translator wants to work on a PO file, he runs 'make update-po'
   which executes:
       msgmerge templates.<xx>.po ../../english/po/templates.pot \
              -o templates.<xx>.po.new && \
              mv templates.<xx>.po.new templates.<xx>.po

Q. Why are HTML generated files not updated after editing templates.<xx>.po?
A. You have to run 'make' in your webwml/<lang>/po/ directory to update
   MO files.

Q. What are those <void> tags in msgids?
A. They are meant to make msgids unique.  Sometimes the same English
   msgid may have different translations depending on context, so
   there must be distinguished; this is the purpose of the <void> tag,
   which does not appear in output.
   There is no reason to put it in msgstr, unless in a very special
   case, if you want an empty translated string.

Q. It doesn't work, what happens?
A. No idea, but ask on <debian-www@lists.debian.org>.  Note that your
   language must have been enabled in /etc/locale.gen, otherwise
   locales do not seem to work :(
