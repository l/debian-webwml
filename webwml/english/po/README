Q. What to do with those <lang>/po directories?
A. Currently nothing, except for testing.  But it would be nice if all
   translators could check that they are able to generate files for
   their language, and that there is no difference.

Q. So how does it work?
A. Read more informations about commands below in gettext documentation.
   When running 'make' in english/ directory, templates.pot is generated.
   This file contains all the translatable strings found in
   english/template/debian/*.wml files.

   Running 'make' in other directories gives:
       msgmerge templates.<xx>.po ../../english/po/templates.pot \
              -o new.templates.<xx>.po
       msgfmt --statistics -o templates.mo new.templates.<xx>.po
   where <xx> is the language code.

   The templates.<xx>.po file is manually handled by translators and 
   put under CVS control.  The new.templates.<xx>.po file is automatically
   generated, and must *never* be committed, otherwise CVS conflicts
   will appear on klecker.debian.org.  The templates.mo file is a binary
   file, and contains a machine-readable representation of templates.<xx>.po.

   This means that translators must check from time to time if their
   templates.<xx>.po file is outdated, in which case they copy
   new.templates.<xx>.po into templates.<xx>.po and commit it.
   Fortunately it is possible to automatically detect those outdated
   translations, and a tool such as check_trans.pl could send notices.

   Last, 'make install' copy templates.mo files under
     webwml/locale/<xx>/LC_MESSAGES/templates.mo

Q. It looks nice, how could I try?
A. You need at least mp4h 1.3.0 (only available in sid), and you must
   add a line
     -I po/template
   *after*
     -I english/template
   in your <lang>/.wmlrc file so that new templates are loaded instead
   of old ones.
   DO NOT COMMIT THESE MODIFIED .WMLRC FILES OR BUILD WILL BE BROKEN

   Then compile pages as usual and check that output do not differ.
   If you want to come back with usual templates, you only have to
   switch the two lines above in <lang>/.wmlrc.

Q. It doesn't work, what happens?
A. No idea, but ask on <debian-www@lists.debian.org>.  Note that your
   language must have been enabled in /etc/locale.gen, otherwise
   locales do not seem to work :(

Q. It works, could I commit changes in PO files instead of slicing?
A. Please don't, <lang>/po/templates.<xx>.po files are currently
   automatically generated from english/template/debian/*.wml, so your
   changes will be lost.
