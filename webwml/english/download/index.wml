<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a
<a href="intro/free">free</a> operating system (OS) for your computer.
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run.
</p>

<p>
Debian provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over
<packages_in_stable> <a href="distrib/packages">packages</a>, precompiled software bundled
up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine. <a href="intro/about"><readmore></a></p>

# Note for translators: these paragraphs are taken from www.d.o/distrib/index

<p>
Debian is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>
over Internet. You can download all of it from any of our
<a href="ftplist">mirrors</a>.
The <a href="../releases/stable/installmanual">Installation Manual</a>

    <p>
      You can try Debian by booting a live system from a CD, DVD or USB key
      without installing any files to the computer. When you are ready, you can
      run the included installer.

  <h2><a href="">Verify your download</a></h2>

     # this is taken from /english/CD/index
   <p>
   Official CD releases are signed so that you can verify they are authentic,
   and that your download has not been corrupted.
   </p>
   
   #these needs work: 
   # which is the folder where people downloaded the image?
   # maybe we should offer two downloads above: the image and the checksum file...
   
   <p>
   Look for the "SHA512SUMS" file in the same directory
   where you downloaded the image, it contains checksums of the images. 
   
   These checksum files are also signed, see the SHA512SUMS.sign file too.
   </p>
   
   #these needs work: 
   # which "checksum verifier tool" to use?
   # maybe we should complete english/CD/verify to include instructions
   # and links to checksum verifier tools for several operating systems.
   # there is also info about verification in https://www.debian.org/CD/faq/#verify
   
   <p>
   With these files and a checksum verifier tool, you can check 
   that the image checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; 
    and that the checksum file has not been tampered with. 
  </p>
  
  <p>

  read the <a href="../CD/verify">verification guide</a>.

   <h2>How to write to USB flash drive</h2>
    
<p>On a GNU/Linux machine, simply use the <q>cp</q> command, to copy an
image to a USB flash drive:</p>

<p><code>cp &lt;file&gt; &lt;device&gt;</code></p>

<p>where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>&lt;file&gt; is the name of the input image, e.g. <q>netinst.iso</q>
  <li>&lt;device&gt; is the device matching the USB flash drive,
  e.g. /dev/sdb, /dev/sdc. <em>Be careful to make sure you have the right
  device name</em>, as this command is capable of writing over your hard
  disk just as easily if you get the wrong one!</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally to the method above for GNU/Linux systems, there is also
   the <a NAME="win32diskimager"
   href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/">win32diskimager</a>
   program available, which allows writing such bootable USB flash
   drives under Windows.

   <h2>How to write to optical media</h2>
    
    <p>
    
<p>On a GNU/Linux machine, use 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/xorriso/xorriso.html">xorriso</a>
for all optical media types (also doable as non-root user):
<br/><tt>xorriso -as cdrecord -v dev=/dev/sr0 -eject debian-x.y.z-arch-MEDIUM-NN.iso</tt>
</p>

<p>You can also use the graphical programs <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/brasero/">Brasero</a>,
<a href="http://k3b.plainblack.com/">K3B</a>, and others.
</p>

<p>In Windows, you can use <a href="https://infrarecorder.org">InfraRecorder</a> to burn the iso file, 
or look for options like <q>ISO9660 file</q>, <q>Raw ISO image</q> in your
preferred optical media writer program.
</p>

<p>In Mac OS X, after opening the Disk Utility application 
(in the <tt>/Applications/Utilities</tt> folder), 
select <i>Burn...</i> in the <i>Image</i> menu and choose the image file 
to burn.
