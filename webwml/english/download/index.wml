<p><a href="https://www.debian.org/">Debian</a> is a
<a href="intro/free">free</a> operating system (OS) for your computer.
An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make
your computer run.
</p>

<p>
Debian provides more than a pure OS: it comes with over
<packages_in_stable> <a href="distrib/packages">packages</a>, precompiled software bundled
up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine. <a href="intro/about"><readmore></a></p>

<p>
Debian is distributed <a href="../intro/free">freely</a>

    <h2><a href="../CD/live/">Try Debian live before installing</a></h2>
    <p>
      You can try Debian by booting a live system from a CD, DVD or USB key
      without installing any files to the computer. When you are ready, you can
      run the included installer.

  <h2><a href="">Verify your download</a></h2>

     # this is taken from /english/CD/index
   <p>
   Official CD releases are signed so that you can verify they are authentic,
   and that your download has not been corrupted.
   </p>
   
   #these needs work: 
   # which is the folder where people downloaded the image?
   # maybe we should offer two downloads above: the image and the checksum file...
   
   <p>
   Look for the "SHA512SUMS" file in the same directory
   where you downloaded the image, it contains checksums of the images. 
   
   These checksum files are also signed, see the SHA512SUMS.sign file too.
   </p>
   
   #these needs work: 
   # which "checksum verifier tool" to use?
   # maybe we should complete english/CD/verify to include instructions
   # and links to checksum verifier tools for several operating systems.
   
   <p>
   With these files and a checksum verifier tool, you can check 
   that the image checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; 
    and that the checksum file has not been tampered with. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  For more information about how to do these steps, 
  read the <a href="../CD/verify">verification guide</a>.
