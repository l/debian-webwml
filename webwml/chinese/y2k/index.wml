<P>One of the goals of Debian is to provide the most robust system possible.
This is why we have created a system that makes upgrading completely seamless
and why we are investigating how Y2K compliant Debian is.

<P>In evaluating whether a system is Y2K compliant you must look at not only
the base system (the kernel and the basic libraries and tools that create a
system), but all the tools that you use every day. The near Y2K compliance
of a system is meaningless if the failure of even a single non-Y2K
compliant component causes your mission critical system to stop functioning.

<P>Unlike some bloated monolithic operating systems on the market, Debian 
is created by adding a large number of tools on top of the Linux kernel. 
This type of design allows parts of the system to be upgraded without 
affecting the rest. It allows for levels of abstraction in design that 
create a much more robust and flexible system.  Since the interaction of 
different components is well understood, we only need to test the Y2K 
compliance of each component to verify the compliance of the system.

<P>As a service to our customers, we are collecting a list of packages 
and their state of the Y2K compliance. Since Y2K compliance is most 
important to IT departments we have separated the list of 'base' 
system packages and components most used on server machines from the 
rest of the packages we provide (over 2500).
