Some notes and ramblings on Chinese translations (and the fun of
maintaining both Big5 and GB pages and hope that all the characters
show up properly.  :-)

Big5<->GB is quite a challenging problem.

Big5 is *bad*!!  Its relationship to Unicode is _not_ one-to-one,
and is giving us a lot of headaches.  Fortunately, in the upcoming
Unicode 3.0, much (if not all) of this issue would be resolved.

The following is from
	ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/MAPPINGS/EASTASIA/OTHER/BIG5.TXT

#       WARNING!  It is currently impossible to provide round-trip compatibility
#               between BIG5 and Unicode.  
#
#       A number of characters are not currently mapped because
#               of conflicts with other mappings.  They are as follows:
#
#       BIG5        Description                    Comments
#
#       0xA15A      SPACING UNDERSCORE             duplicates A1C4
#       0xA1C3      SPACING HEAVY OVERSCORE        not in Unicode
#       0xA1C5      SPACING HEAVY UNDERSCORE       not in Unicode
#       0xA1FE      LT DIAG UP RIGHT TO LOW LEFT   duplicates A2AC
#       0xA240      LT DIAG UP LEFT TO LOW RIGHT   duplicates A2AD
#       0xA2CC      HANGZHOU NUMERAL TEN           conflicts with A451 mapping
#       0xA2CE      HANGZHOU NUMERAL THIRTY        conflicts with A4CA mapping
#
#       We currently map all of these characters to U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER

Another reference is the Big5+ standard tables.  At least it won't
leave any Big5+ codes dangling.  :-)  It does include a Big5+ to GBK
table, but then, we want GB, not GBK.  Hmm...


Converter
~~~~~~~~~
 * Don't bother with tcs.  Due to the traditional/simplified character
   issue, tcs simply doesn't work well at all.

 * utf-converter works but need more tweaking to get everything translated
   properly.  (1999-12-28 update: Nah, let's not bother with utf-converter
   when we have zh-AutoConvert.  :-)
