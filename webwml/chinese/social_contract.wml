<P>Debian, the producers of the Debian GNU/Linux system, have created the
<strong>Debian Social Contract</strong>. The contract, initially designed
as as a set of commitments that we agree to abide by, has been adopted by
the free software community as the basis of the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</a>.

<H2>"Social Contract" with the Free Software Community</H2>

   <LI><P><strong>Debian Will Remain 100% Free Software</strong>
     <P>We promise to keep the Debian GNU/Linux Distribution
     entirely free software. As there are many definitions of
     free software, we include the guidelines we use to determine
     if software is "<em>free</em>" below.  We will support our
     users who develop and run non-free software on Debian, but
     we will never make the system depend on an item of non-free
     software.</P>
   <LI><strong>We Will Give Back to the Free Software Community</strong>
     <P>When we write new components of the Debian system, we will
     license them as free software. We will make the best system
     we can, so that free software will be widely distributed and
     used. We will feed back bug-fixes, improvements, user
     requests, etc. to the "<em>upstream</em>" authors of software
     included in our system.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>We Won't Hide Problems</strong>
     <P>We will keep our entire bug-report database open for public
     view at all times. Reports that users file on-line will
     immediately become visible to others.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>Our Priorities are Our Users and Free Software</strong>
     <P>We will be guided by the needs of our users and the
     free-software community. We will place their interests first
     in our priorities. We will support the needs of our users
     for operation in many different kinds of computing
     environment. We won't object to commercial software that is
     intended to run on Debian systems, and we'll allow others to
     create value-added distributions containing both Debian and
     commercial software, without any fee from us. To support
     these goals, we will provide an integrated system of
     high-quality, 100% free software, with no legal restrictions
     that would prevent these kinds of use.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>Programs That Don't Meet Our Free-Software Standards</strong>
     <P>We acknowledge that some of our users require the use of
     programs that don't conform to the 
     <a href="#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>.
     We have created "<tt>contrib</tt>" and "<tt>non-free</tt>"
     areas in our FTP archive for this software. The software in
     these directories is not part of the Debian system, although
     it has been configured for use with Debian.  We encourage CD
     manufacturers to read the licenses of software packages in
     these directories and determine if they can distribute that
     software on their CDs. Thus, although non-free software
     isn't a part of Debian, we support its use, and we provide
     infrastructure (such as our bug-tracking system and mailing
     lists) for non-free software packages.
