<h1>How to report a bug in Debian</h1>

Send mail to
<A href="mailto:submit@bugs.debian.org"><code>submit@bugs.debian.org</code></A>,
as described below.
<p>

Please don't report several unrelated bugs - especially ones in
different packages - in one message.  Also, please don't mail your bug
report to any mailing lists or recipients other than
<code>submit@bugs</code> (for details of how to do this right, see
<A href="#xcc">below</A>).
<p>

Lists of currently-outstanding bugs are available <A href="./">on
the World Wide Web</A> and <A href="Access">elsewhere</A> - see
other documents for details.
<p>

You should put a pseudo-header at the start of the body of the
message, with the <code>Package:</code> and <code>Version:</code>
lines giving the name and version of the package which has the bug.
(The pseudo-header fields must start at the very start of their lines,
and the bug system does not currently understand them if they're
buried in MIMEd or PGPd mail.)
(You can get these using
<code>dpkg --search</code> and <code>dpkg --list</code>; see
<code>dpkg --help</code>.

<em>See below for <A href="#details">further requirements</A></em>.
<p>

There are some pseudo-packages available for putting in the
<code>Package</code> line when reporting a bug in something other than
an actual Debian software package.
There is <A href="db/ix/pseudopackages.html">a list of these</A>
on the bugs WWW pages.


<h2><A name="example">Example</A></h2>

A bug report, with mail header, looks something like this:
<pre>
  To: submit@bugs.debian.org
  From: diligent@testing.linux.org
  Subject: Hello says `goodbye'

  <A name="pseudoheader">Package: hello</A>
  Version: 1.3-2

  When I invoke `hello' without arguments from an ordinary shell
  prompt it prints `goodbye', rather than the expected `hello, world'.
  Here is a transcript:

  $ hello
  goodbye
  $ /usr/bin/hello
  goodbye
  $

  I suggest that the output string, in hello.c, be corrected.

  I am using Debian 1.1, kernel version 1.3.99.15z
  and libc 5.2.18.3.2.1.3-beta.
</pre>

<h2><A name="details">Please include in your report:</A></h2>

<ul>
<li>The <em>exact</em> and <em>complete</em> text of any error
messages printed or logged.  This is very important!
<li>Exactly what you typed or did to demonstrate the problem.
<li>A description of the incorrect behaviour: exactly what behaviour
you were expecting, and what you observed.  A transcript of an
example session is a good way of showing this.
<li>A suggested fix, or even a patch, if you have one.
<li>Details of the configuration of the program with the problem.
Include the complete text of its configuration files.
<li>The versions of any packages on which the buggy package depends.
<li>What kernel version you're using (type <code>uname -a</code>).
<li>What shared C library you're using (type <code>ls -l /lib/libc.so.6</code>).
<li>Any other details of your Linux system, if it seems appropriate.  For
example, if you had a problem with a Debian Perl script, you would want
to provide the version of the `perl' binary (<code>perl -v</code>).
<li>Appropriate details of the hardware in your system.  If you're
reporting a problem with a device driver please list <em>all</em> the
hardware in your system, as problems are often caused by IRQ and I/O
address conflicts.

</ul>

Include any detail that seems relevant - you are in very little danger
of making your report too long by including too much information.  If
they are small please include in your report any files you were using
to reproduce the problem (uuencoding them if they may contain odd
characters etc.).

<p>

Of course, like any email, you should include a clear, descriptive
<code>Subject</code> line in your main mail header.  The subject you
give will be used as the initial bug title in the tracking system, so
please try to make it informative !

<h2><A name="xcc">Sending copies of bug reports to other addresses</A></h2>

Sometimes it is necessary to send a copy of a bug report to somewhere
else besides <code>debian-bugs-dist</code> and the package maintainer,
which is where they are normally sent.
<p>

You could do this by CC'ing your bug report to the other address(es),
but then the other copies would not have the bug report number put in
the <code>Reply-To</code> field and the <code>Subject</code> line.
When the recipients reply they will probably preserve the
<code>submit@bugs.debian.org</code> entry in the header and have their
message filed as a new bug report.  This leads to many duplicated
reports.
<p>

The <em>right</em> way to do this is to use the
<code>X-Debbugs-CC</code> header.  Add a line like this to your
message's mail header (not to the pseudo header with the
<code>Package</code> field):
<pre>
 X-Debbugs-CC: other-list@cosmic.edu
</pre>
This will cause the bug tracking system to send a copy of your report
to the address(es) in the <code>X-Debbugs-CC</code> line as well as to
<code>debian-bugs-dist</code>.
<p>

This feature can often be combined usefully with mailing
<code>quiet</code> - see below.


<h2><A name="severities">Severity levels</A></h2>

If a report is of a particularly serious bug, or is merely a feature
request that, you can set the severity level of the bug as you report
it.  This is not required, however, and the developers will assign an
appropriate severity level to your report if you do not.
<p>

To assign a severity level put a
<code>Severity: <var>severity</var></code> line in the pseudo-header,
together with <code>Package</code> and <code>Version</code>.  The
severity levels available are described in the
<A href="Developer#severities">developers' documentation</A>.


<h2>Not forwarding to the mailing list - minor bug reports</h2>

If a bug report is minor (for example, a documentation typo or other
trivial build problem), or you're submitting many reports at once,
send them to <code>maintonly@bugs</code> or <code>quiet@bugs</code>.
<code>maintonly</code> will send the report on to the package
maintainer (provided you supply a correct <code>Package</code> line in
the pseudo-header and the maintainer is known), and <code>quiet</code>
will not forward it anywhere at all but only file it as a bug (useful
if, for example, you are submitting many similar bugs and want to post
only a summary).
<p>

If you do this the bug system will set the <code>Reply-To</code> of
any forwarded message so that replies will by default be processed in
the same way as the original report.

<h3>Unknown packages or bugs with no <code>Package</code> key</h3>

If the bug tracking system doesn't know who the maintainer of the
relevant package is it'll forward the report to
<code>debian-bugs-dist</code> even if <code>maintonly</code> was used.
<p>

When sending to <code>maintonly@bugs</code> or
<var>nnn</var><code>-maintonly@bugs</code> you should make sure that
the bug report is assigned to the right package, by putting a correct
<code>Package</code> at the top of an original submission of a report,
or by using <A href="server-control">the
<code>control@bugs</code> service</A> to (re)assign the report
appropriately first if it isn't correct already.

<h2>Using <code>dpkg</code> to find the package and version for the report</h2>

If you are reporting a bug in a command, you can find out which
package installed it by using <code>dpkg --search</code>.  You can
find out which version of a package you have installed by using
<code>dpkg --list</code> or <code>dpkg --status</code>.

<p>

For example:
<pre>
$ which dpkg
/usr/bin/dpkg
$ type dpkg
dpkg is hashed (/usr/bin/dpkg)
$ dpkg --search /usr/bin/dpkg
dpkg: /usr/bin/dpkg
$ dpkg --search '*/dpkg'
dpkg: /usr/doc/copyright/dpkg
dpkg: /var/lib/dpkg
dpkg: /usr/bin/dpkg
dpkg: /usr/lib/dpkg
dpkg: /usr/doc/dpkg
$ dpkg --list dpkg
Desired=Unknown/Install/Remove/Purge

Description: Package maintenance system for Debian GNU/Linux
 This package contains the programs which handle the installation and
 removal of packages on your system.
 .
 The primary interface for the dpkg suite is the `dselect' program;
 a more low-level and less user-friendly interface is available in
 the form of the `dpkg' command.
