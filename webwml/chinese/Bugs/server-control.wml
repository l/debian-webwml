<h1>錯誤控制與操縱郵件伺服器的簡介</h1>
#<h1>Introduction to the bug control and manipulation mailserver</h1>

除了能以電子郵件方式取回錯誤資料和文件的郵件伺服\
器 <code>request@bugs.debian.org</code> 之外，還有另外一個伺服\
器 <code>control@bugs.debian.org</code> 提供不同的方式來操縱錯誤報告。
#<P>In addition to the mailserver on <code>request@bugs.debian.org</code>
#which allows the retrieval of bug data and documentation by email,
#there is another server on <code>control@bugs.debian.org</code> which
#also allows bug reports to be manipulated in various ways.</P>

<P>除了有額外的命令外，該控制(control)伺服器的運作類似於請求(request)伺服器\
；實際上是一樣的程式。用兩個不同郵件地址是為了避免使用者弄錯，只為了要一些資\
訊卻惹出麻煩。
#<P>The control server works just like the request server, except that it
#has some additional commands; in fact, it's the same program.  The two
#addresses are only separated to avoid users making mistakes and
#causing problems while merely trying to request information.</P>

<P>請參考ＷＷＷ上，檔案 <code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code> 中的
<A href="server-request#introduction">請求伺服器的簡介</A>，或送一封
<code>help</code> 郵件到任一個郵件伺服器以取得操作這些郵件伺服器的基礎，以及\
寄信到任一個郵件地址時可用的命令。
#<P>Please see the
#<A href="server-request#introduction">introduction to the request server</A>
#available on the World Wide Web, in the file
#<code>bug-log-mailserver.txt</code>, or by sending
#<code>help</code> to either mailserver, for details of the basics of
#operating the mailservers and the common commands available when
#mailing either address.</P>

<P>郵件伺服器的 <A href="server-refcard">備忘卡</A> 可由ＷＷＷ的\
<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> 取得，或使用 <code>refcard</code>
郵件命令。
#<P>The <A href="server-refcard">reference card</A> for the
#mailservers is available via the WWW, in
#<code>bug-mailserver-refcard.txt</code> or by email using the
#<code>refcard</code> command).</P>

<H1>僅能在控制(control)郵件伺服器使用的命令</H1>
#<H1>Commands available only at the control mailserver</H1>

<dl>

<dt><code>close</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

關閉錯誤號碼 #<var>bugnumber</var> 錯誤報告。
#Close bug report #<var>bugnumber</var>.

<p>A notification is sent to the user who reported the bug, but (in
contrast to mailing <var>bugnumber</var><code>-done@bugs</code>) the
text of the mail which caused the bug to be closed is <em>not</em>
included in that notification.  The maintainer who closes a report
should ensure, probably by sending a separate message, that the user
who reported the bug knows why it is being closed.

<dt><code>reassign</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>package</var>
<dd>

Records that bug #<var>bugnumber</var> is a bug in <var>package</var>.
This can be used to set the package if the user forgot the
pseudo-header, or to change an earlier assignment.  No notifications
are sent to anyone (other than the usual information in the processing
transcript).

<dt><code>reopen</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
 [ <var>originator-address</var> | <code>=</code> | <code>!</code> ]
<dd>

Reopens #<var>bugnumber</var> if it is closed.

<p>By default, or if you specify <code>=</code>, the original submitter is
still as the originator of the report, so that they will get the ack
when it is closed again.</p>

<p>If you supply an <var>originator-address</var> the originator will be
set to the address you supply.  If you wish to become the new
originator of the reopened report you can use the <code>!</code>
shorthand or specify your own email address.</p>

<p>It is usually a good idea to tell the person who is about to be
recorded as the originator that you're reopening the report, so that
they will know to expect the ack which they'll get when it is closed
again.</p>

<p>If the bug is not closed then reopen won't do anything, not even
change the originator.  There is no way to change the originator of an
open bug report (this is deliberate, so that you can't have a bug be
closed and then deleted 28 days later without someone being told about
it).

<dt><code>forwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>address</var>
<dd>

Notes that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to the upstream
maintainer at <var>address</var>.  This does not actually forward the
report.  This can be used to change an existing incorrect forwarded-to
address, or to record a new one for a bug that wasn't previously noted
as having been forwarded.

<dt><code>notforwarded</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Forgets any idea that <var>bugnumber</var> has been forwarded to any
upstream maintainer.  If the bug was not recorded as having been
forwarded then this will do nothing.

<dt><code>retitle</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>new-title</var>
<dd>

Changes the title of a bug report to that specified (the default is
the <code>Subject</code> mail header from the original report.

<p>Unlike most of the other bug-manipulation commands when used on one of
a set of merged reports this will change the title of only the
individual bug requested, and not all those with which it is merged.

<dt><code>severity</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>severity</var>
<dd>

<p>Set the severity level for bug report #<var>bugnumber</var> to
<var>severity</var>.  No notification is sent to the user who reported
the bug.</p>

<p>Severities are <code>critical</code>, <code>grave</code>,
<code>normal</code>, <code>important</code>, and <code>wishlist</code>.

<p>For <A href="Developer#severities">their meanings</A> please
consult the general developers' documentation for the bug system.

<dt><code>merge</code> <var>bugnumber</var> <var>bugnumber</var> ...
<dd>

Merges two or more bug reports.  When reports are merged opening,
closing, marking or unmarking as forwarded and reassigning any of the
bugs to a new package will have an identical effect on all of the
merged reports.

<p>Before bugs can be merged they must be in exactly the same state:
either all open or all closed, with the same forwarded-to upstream
author address or all not marked as forwarded, and all assigned to the
same package or package(s) (an exact string comparison is done on the
package to which the bug is assigned).  If they don't start out in the
same state you should use <code>reassign</code>, <code>reopen</code>
and so forth to make sure that they are before using
<code>merge</code>.</p>

<P>If any of the bugs listed in a <code>merge</code> command is already
merged with another bug then all the reports merged with any of the
ones listed will all be merged together.  Merger is like equality: it
is reflexive, transitive and symmetric.</p>

<P>Merging reports causes a note to appear on each report's logs; on the
WWW pages this is includes links to the other bugs.</p>

<P>Merged reports are all expired simultaneously, and only when all of
the reports each separately meet the criteria for expiry.

<dt><code>unmerge</code> <var>bugnumber</var>
<dd>

Disconnects a bug report from any other reports with which it may have
been merged.  If the report listed is merged with several others then
they are all left merged with each other; only their associations with
the bug explicitly named are removed.

<p>If many bug reports are merged and you wish to split them into two
separate groups of merged reports you must unmerge each report in one
of the new groups separately and then merge them into the required new
group.</p>

<p>You can only unmerge one report with each <code>unmerge</code>
command; if you want to disconnect more than one bug simply include
several <code>unmerge</code> commands in your message.
