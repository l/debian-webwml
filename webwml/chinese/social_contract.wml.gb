<P>Debian, the producers of the Debian GNU/Linux system, have created the
<strong>Debian Social Contract</strong>. The contract, initially designed
as as a set of commitments that we agree to abide by, has been adopted by
the free software community as the basis of the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org/osd.html">Open Source Definition</a>.

<HR>
<H2>"Social Contract" with the Free Software Community</H2>
<OL>
   <LI><P><strong>Debian Will Remain 100% Free Software</strong>
     <P>We promise to keep the Debian GNU/Linux Distribution
     entirely free software. As there are many definitions of
     free software, we include the guidelines we use to determine
     if software is "<em>free</em>" below.  We will support our
     users who develop and run non-free software on Debian, but
     we will never make the system depend on an item of non-free
     software.</P>
   <LI><strong>We Will Give Back to the Free Software Community</strong>
     <P>When we write new components of the Debian system, we will
     license them as free software. We will make the best system
     we can, so that free software will be widely distributed and
     used. We will feed back bug-fixes, improvements, user
     requests, etc. to the "<em>upstream</em>" authors of software
     included in our system.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>We Won't Hide Problems</strong>
     <P>We will keep our entire bug-report database open for public
     view at all times. Reports that users file on-line will
     immediately become visible to others.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>Our Priorities are Our Users and Free Software</strong>
     <P>We will be guided by the needs of our users and the
     free-software community. We will place their interests first
     in our priorities. We will support the needs of our users
     for operation in many different kinds of computing
     environment. We won't object to commercial software that is
     intended to run on Debian systems, and we'll allow others to
     create value-added distributions containing both Debian and
     commercial software, without any fee from us. To support
     these goals, we will provide an integrated system of
     high-quality, 100% free software, with no legal restrictions
     that would prevent these kinds of use.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>Programs That Don't Meet Our Free-Software Standards</strong>
     <P>We acknowledge that some of our users require the use of
     programs that don't conform to the 
     <a href="#guidelines">Debian Free Software Guidelines</a>.
     We have created "<tt>contrib</tt>" and "<tt>non-free</tt>"
     areas in our FTP archive for this software. The software in
     these directories is not part of the Debian system, although
     it has been configured for use with Debian.  We encourage CD
     manufacturers to read the licenses of software packages in
     these directories and determine if they can distribute that
     software on their CDs. Thus, although non-free software
     isn't a part of Debian, we support its use, and we provide
     infrastructure (such as our bug-tracking system and mailing
     lists) for non-free software packages.

   <LI><P><strong>免费自由重复散布</strong>
     <P>Debian 某 component 许可证不得限制任何
     一方销售或让予作为其组成部分之一的????开放性原始码程式。
     该许可证不得要求从是项销售中索取使用费或其他费用。
     The license of a Debian component may not restrict any
     party from selling or giving away the software as a
     component of an aggregate software distribution containing
     programs from several different sources. The license may not
     require a royalty or other fee for such sale.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>原程式码</strong>
     <P>软件应附有原程式码，该软件除以编辑后的形式散布外，
     还应允许以原程式码的形式散布。
     <P>The program must include source code, and must allow
     distribution in source code as well as compiled
     form.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>衍生软件</strong>
     <P>许可证应允许修改软件和衍生软件，并允许修改后的软件和衍生出的软件
	以原软件的同一条款散布。
     The license must allow modifications and derived works, and
     must allow them to be distributed under the same terms as
     the license of the original software.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>原作者程式码的 Integrity</strong>
     <P>许可证可限制原程式码以修改后的形式散布，除非为修改软件的目的在最后编辑
     时原始码连同修改程式一起散布。许可证必须明确规定允许散布根据修改后的
     原程式码编制的软件。许可证可要求衍生软件使用不同的名称或版本号码,有别
     与原始软件。（<em>This is a compromise.  The Debian group
     encorages all authors to not 限制任何档案、source or binary,
     from being modified.)</P>   
     <P>The license may restrict source-code from being distributed
     in modified form _<strong>only</strong>_ if the license allows
     the distribution of "<tt>patch files</tt>" with the source
     code for the purpose of modifying the program at build
     time. The license must explicitly permit distribution of
     software built from modified source code. The license may
     require derived works to carry a different name or version
     number from the original software.  (<em>This is a
     compromise. The Debian group encourages all authors to not
     restrict any files, source or binary, from being
     modified.</em>)</P>
   <LI><P><strong>不得歧视任何人或团体</strong>
     <P>许可证不得歧视任何人或多人组成的团体。
     The license must not discriminate against any person or
     group of persons.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</strong>
     <P>The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the
     program in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may
     not restrict the program from being used in a business, or
     from being used for genetic research.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>Distribution of License</strong>
     <P>The rights attached to the program must apply to all to
     whom the program is redistributed without the need for
     execution of an additional license by those
     parties.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>License Must Not Be Specific to Debian</strong>
     <P>与程式有关的任何权利不得由该程式是否为某一特定软件的一部分来决定。
     如果从一套软件中取用一组程式，并根据该程式的规定使用或散布这组程式，
     则得到这组程式的所有各方的权利与得到 Debian 系统的使用者的权利相同。</P>
     <P>The rights attached to the program must not depend on the
     program's being part of a Debian system. If the program is
     extracted from Debian and used or distributed without Debian
     but otherwise within the terms of the program's license, all
     parties to whom the program is redistributed should have the
     same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with
     the Debian system.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>许可证的规定不得影响其他软件</strong>
     <P>许可证不得对其他与此软件一起散布的软件作出任何限制的规定。
     例如，许可证不得坚持要求所有根据同一介质散布的其他软件都必须宥     为自由软件。
     <P>The license must not place restrictions on other software
     that is distributed along with the licensed
     software. For example, the license must not insist that all
     other programs distributed on the same medium must be free
     software.</P>
   <LI><P><strong>许可证范例</strong>
     <P>"<strong><a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GPL</a></strong>"、
     "<strong><a href="misc/bsd.license">BSD</a></strong>", and
     "<strong><a href="http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html">Artistic</a></strong>"
     许可证均可视为符合开放性原始码定义的许可证范例。 
licenses are examples of licenses that we consider 「<em>自由</em>」。.

<P><EM>Bruce Perens wrote the first draft of this document
and refined it using the comments of the Debian developers
during a month-long e-mail conference in June 1997.  He
later removed the Debian-specific references from the
Debian 自由软体 Guidelines to create &ldquo;The Open
Source Definition&rdquo;.</EM>

我翻译了"开放性原始码的定义"和与其相关的说明。
我认为开放性原始码这个概念可能成为未来Linux 世界的主导。
在这层意义上，这两份文件可能非常重要，值得国内电脑喜好者的注意。
译文之后都附了原文，以供读者参考。
<P>
在此这两份文件均为译文在前，原文在后。
也许可照原来网站的方式把两份文件串在一起。
