<P>The following is an example which will mirror both the web and ftp site.
You will have to modify the machine name and the directories involved to
match your situation.

<P>The lockfile is useful if you run this using a cron job. If, for any reason,
the mirror doesn't complete, the next time the mirror tries to run you will get
mail. You can then track down where the problem lies, fix it, delete the lockfile and
the mirror will work properly the next time it is run.
<blockquote>
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
set -e

lockfile -r 1 rsync.master.lock || exit 23

rsync -avz -e ssh --exclude .glbuild --delete &lt;machine&gt;:/web/debian.org/ debian.org
rsync -avz -e ssh --delete &lt;machine&gt;:/web/debian.org-local/ debian.org-local

echo FINISHED UPDATING WEB. WORKING ON FTP NOW.

rsync -avz --delete -e ssh &lt;machine&gt;:/debian debian

rm -f rsync.master.lock

<H3>How to set up ssh so you aren't asked for a password:</H3>

<P>The script given above will prompt you for a password unless you set up
ssh a certain way. First, when you use ssh-keygen, just hit return when
asked for a password [1]. Next, add the contents
of ~/.ssh/identity.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the mirror site (the
file should be mode 600).
You should then be able to use ssh to log in to the mirror site without
being asked for a password.

<P>
[1] Note that setting up ssh with a blank password gives an intruder free
access
to the site you are mirroring once they have broken into your site.
For this reason, this should never be done from root.
