<h1>Debian 計劃憲章（版本 1.0）</h1>

<h2>一、導引</h2>

<P><cite>Debian 計劃 (Debian Project) 是由一群致力於發展一個自由作業系統的\
人仕組成的組織。</cite></P>

<p>

本文陳述決策本計劃事務的組織架構。這裡不會描述計劃的目標及達到此目標的\
方法，亦不會涉及任何有關行政上的資料，除非與決策過程有直接關係。

<h2>二、決策團體及個人</h2>

<p>計劃的每一個決定是由以下一個或多個的項目制定：

<ol>
  <li>開發人員 (developer)，經由全民決議 (General Resolution) 或投票；
  <li>計劃領袖 (Project Leader)；
  <li>技術委員會 (Technical Committee) 和／或技術委員會的主席 (Chairman)；
#      The individual Developer working on a particular task;
  <li>某一特定工作中的開發人員；
  <li>被計劃領袖委派為某一特定工作的代表 (delegate)；
#      Delegates appointed by the Project Leader for specific tasks.
  <li>計劃秘書 (Project Secretary)
</ol>

本文件的大部份內容將會用來概述這些體系的權力，他們的組成和工作，及\
他們決策時的程序。某人或團體的權力有可能會受到調查和／或受到別人所\
限，在這個情況下，進行調查的人員會有所交代。<cite>在以上的列表當中\
，能夠被否決的個人或團體通常是放在否決者之下，被委任人或團體也通常\
是放在委任者（或協助委任者）之下 ─ 但不是所有列在前面的也能否決在\
後面的。</cite>

<h3>2.1. 一般規則</h3>

<ol>
  <li><p>
這憲章並沒有強迫任何人去為本計劃工作。於某人不願意做一個曾被委任給\
他的工作，他是不需要去做的。但他們不能積極地違反這些規則，以及在這\
些規則之下達成的決定。
   </p><li><p>
一人可以擁有多個職位，計劃領袖例外。秘書及技術委員會主席不能是同一\
人，計劃領袖亦不能委派他們成為他們自己的代表。
  </p><li><p>
    任何人仕只要公開聲明，就可以隨時離開本計劃或辭退他所擁有的職位。
</ol>

<h2>三、個別開發人員</h2>

<h3>3.1. 權力</h3>

<P>個別開發人員可以
<ol>
  <li>對自己的工作進行技術性或非技術性的決定；
  <li>建議或提出全民決議草案；
  <li>自薦為計劃領袖候選人；
  <li>在全民決議和領袖選舉中投票。
</ol>

<h3>3.2. 組成及工作</h3>

<ol><li><p>
開發人員為願意在他們參與的期間推動計劃目標的志願工作者，他們亦會\
為計劃維護軟件套件／軟件包 (package) 或領袖代表認為值得進行的其他工作。

</p><li><p>
計劃領袖委派的代表可能會選擇不接受新的開發人員，又或開除現任的開\
發人員。<cite>如開發人員認為代表濫用職權，當然，他們可以利用全民決\
議來凌駕那些決定 ─ 詳見 &sect;4.1(3), &sect;4.2。</cite>

</ol>

<h3>3.3. 程序</h3>

<P>開發人員如果認為恰當，他們可以隨時作出這些決定。
#    Developers may make these decisions as they see fit.

<h2>四、The Developers by way of General Resolution or election</h2>

<h3>4.1. 權力</h3>

<P>總括來說，開發人員可以：
<ol>
  <li><p>任命或召回計劃領袖。
	</p>
  <li><p>修改憲章，只要有 ３：１ 的大多數同意他們。
	</p>
  <li><p>拒絕接受計劃領袖或代表的任何決定。
	</p>
  <li><p>拒絕接受技術委員會的任何決定，只要有 ２：１ 的大多數同意他們。
	</p>
  <li><p>分發非技術性的政策文件及聲明。
	<p>
  這類文件包括有描述本計劃目標的，與其他自由軟件團體<comment>entity</comment>\
  的關係的，以及非技術性政策的，如 Debian 的軟件必需要符合的自由軟件\
  許可證條款 (licence terms)。
	<p>
  文件亦可以是有關當時熱門話題的立場聲明。
	</p>
  <li><p>與計劃領袖及 SPI 作出一些關於為 Debian 而受委托代管的財產的\
  決定。（&sect;9.1）
</ol>

<h3>4.2. 程序</h3>
<ol><li><p>
  開發人員需要根據以下敘述的一般議決程序 (Standard Resolution Procedure)\
  。如要提出議決或修改， 任何的一名開發人員可以提議，但要得到至少 K \
  名其他的開發人員保證 (sponsor)，又或是由計劃領袖或技術委員會提議。
</p><li><p>延遲計劃領袖或其代表的決策：
<ol><li>如計劃領袖或其代表，又或技術委員會作出了一個決策，\
        開發人員可以利用通過議決的方式來推翻他們的決定；見 s4.1(3)。
<li>
  如議決得到至少 2K 名開發人員的保證，又或是由技術委員會建議的；\
  若議決要求將是項決定凍結，那麼是項決定將被立即凍結。
<li>
  如原來的決策是要求更改討論的期限或投票的期限，又或者議決是要求推翻\
  技術委員會的決策，在這樣的情況下只需要 K 名的開發人員去保證議決來\
  凍結是項決策。
<li>
#      決策被凍結後，投票將會立即進行來決定是項決策是否
  If the decision is put on hold, an immediate vote is held to
  determine whether the decision will stand until the full vote on
  the decision is made or whether the implementation of the
  original decision will be be delayed until then.  There is no
  quorum for this immediate procedural vote.
<li>
  如計劃領袖（或其代表）收回原先的決策，投票雖未有結果，但亦不會繼續進行。
</ol>
<li><p>
  投票是有計劃秘書處理。票數和統計是不會在投票進行中發表的；投票\
  結束後，計劃秘書將會列出所有投過的票。投票時期為兩星期，但計劃\
  領袖可將它加減一星期。當投票的結果可以被確定的時候，計劃秘書亦\
  可將投票終止。
</p><li><p>
  最短的討論時期為兩星期，但計劃領袖可將它加減一星期。計劃領袖\
  擁有一決定票。法定人數為３Ｑ。
</p><li><p>
  建議，保證，修改，投票通知，和其他正式的行動需要由計劃領袖的代表，\
  在公開的電子郵遞列表中作出宣布；任何開發人員可以在那裡發表言論。
</p><li><p>
  投票是利用電子郵件，並在適合秘書的方式下進行。\
  每個選舉中已投的票可否更改則視乎秘書的決定。
</p><li><p>
  Ｑ是目前開發人員數目的平方根的一半。Ｋ是Ｑ或５中較細的一個。\
  Ｑ和Ｋ都不需要是整數，也不需要四捨五入。
</ol>

<h2>五、計劃領袖</h2>

<h3>5.1. 權力</h3>

<P>計劃領袖可以：
<ol>
  <li>委任代表 (Delegates) 或將決定付托給技術委員會。
	<p>
  計劃領袖可以定義一個範圍用以函括一些執行中的職務，又或定義\
  一個特定的決定，並把它交托給另一名開發人員或技術委員會。
	<p>
  當做了一個決定並被委派了的時候，計劃領袖不可撤銷此委任；\
  惟他們可以撤銷一個進行中的職務範圍之委任。
	</p>
  <li><p>向其他開發人員作出正式的支持
	<p>
  計劃領袖可以制訂支持某些觀點或計劃中其他成員的聲明，無論是被要求與否；\
  這些聲明只是當計劃領袖被授權作某問題的決定時才真正有力。
	</p>
  <li><p>制定需要逼切行動的決定
	<p>
  不適用於由於缺乏適當行動而漸變成逼切的決定，除非時限已定。
	</p>
  <li><p>制定任何人也不需要負責的決定。
	</p>
  <li><p>提出全民決議草案及修訂。
	</p>
  <li><p>與技術委員會共同委任委員會的新成員。（見 &sect;6.2.）
	</p>
  <li>當開發人員投票時投出決定票。
	<p>
  計劃領袖亦同時擁有一次普通的投票。
	</p>
  <li><p>更改開發人員投票的討論階段期限（如上）。
	</p>
  <li><p>帶領開發人員進行討論。
	<p>
  計劃領袖在參與開發人員中的討論的時候應嘗試協助討論集中於\
  討論的重點問題。計劃領袖不應利用他的領導身份來提倡自己的\
  個人觀點。
	</p>
  <li><p>與 SPI 共同制訂與 Debian 有關的信托資產。（見 &sect;9.1）
</ol>


<H3>5.2. Appointment</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>The Project Leader is elected by the Developers.</LI>

  <LI>The election begins nine weeks before the leadership post becomes
  vacant, or (if it is too late already) immediately.</LI>

  <LI>For the following three weeks any Developer may nominate
  themselves as a candidate Project Leader.</LI>

  <LI>For three weeks after that no more candidates may be nominated;
  candidates should use this time for campaigning (to make their
  identities and positions known).  If there are no candidates at the
  end of the nomination period then the nomination period is extended
  for three further weeks, repeatedly if necessary.</LI>

  <LI>The next three weeks are the polling period during which
  Developers may cast their votes.  Votes in leadership elections are
  kept secret, even after the election is finished.</LI>

  <LI>The options on the ballot will be those candidates who have
  nominated themselves and have not yet withdrawn, plus None Of The
  Above.  If None Of The Above wins the election then the election
  procedure is repeated, many times if necessary.</LI>

  <LI>The decision will be made using Concorde Vote Counting.  The
  quorum is the same as for a General Resolution (&sect;4.2) and the
  default option is None Of The Above.</LI>

  <LI>The Project Leader serves for one year from their election.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>5.3. Procedure</H3>

<P>The Project Leader should attempt to make decisions which are
consistent with the consensus of the opinions of the Developers.</P>

<P>Where practical the Project Leader should informally solicit the
views of the Developers.</P>

<P>The Project Leader should avoid overemphasizing their own point of
view when making decisions in their capacity as Leader.</P>

<H2>6. Technical committee</H2>

<H3>6.1. Powers</H3>

<P>The Technical Committee may:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <P>Decide on any matter of technical policy.</P>

    <P>This includes the contents of the technical policy manuals,
    developers' reference materials, example packages and the behaviour
    of non-experimental package building tools.  (In each case the usual
    maintainer of the relevant software or documentation makes
    decisions initially, however; see 6.3(5).)</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Decide any technical matter where Developers' jurisdictions
    overlap.</P>

    <P>In cases where Developers need to implement compatible
    technical policies or stances (for example, if they disagree about
    the priorities of conflicting packages, or about ownership of a
    command name, or about which package is responsible for a bug that
    both maintainers agree is a bug, or about who should be the
    maintainer for a package) the technical committee may decide the
    matter.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Make a decision when asked to do so.</P>

    <P>Any person or body may delegate a decision of their own to the
    Technical Committee, or seek advice from it.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Overrule a Developer (requires a 3:1 majority).</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee may ask a Developer to take a
    particular technical course of action even if the Developer does
    not wish to; this requires a 3:1 majority.  For example, the
    Committee may determine that a complaint made by the submitter of a
    bug is justified and that the submitter's proposed solution should
    be implemented.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Offer advice.</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee may make formal announcements about its
    views on any matter.  <CITE>Individual members may of course make
    informal statements about their views and about the likely views of
    the committee.</CITE></P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Together with the Project Leader, appoint new members to itself
    or remove existing members.  (See &sect;6.2.)</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Appoint the Chairman of the Technical Committee.</P>

    <P>The Chairman is elected by the Committee from its members.  All
    members of the committee are automatically nominated; the committee
    vote starting one week before the post will become vacant (or
    immediately, if it is already too late).  The members may vote by
    public acclamation for any fellow committee member, including
    themselves; there is no None Of The Above option.  The vote finishes
    when all the members have voted or when the outcome is no longer in
    doubt.  The result is determined according to Concorde Vote
    Counting.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>The Chairman can stand in for the Leader, together with the
    Secretary</P>

    <P>As detailed in &sect;7.1(2), the Chairman of the Technical
    Committee and the Project Secretary may together stand in for the
    Leader if there is no Leader.</P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<H3>6.2. Composition</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <P>The Technical Committee consists of up to 8 Developers, and
    should usually have at least 4 members.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>When there are fewer than 8 members the Technical Committee may
    recommend new member(s) to the Project Leader, who may choose
    (individually) to appoint them or not.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>When there are 5 members or fewer the Technical Committee may
    appoint new member(s) until the number of members reaches 6.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>When there have been 5 members or fewer for at least one week
    the Project Leader may appoint new member(s) until the number of
    members reaches 6, at intervals of at least one week per
    appointment.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>If the Technical Committee and the Project Leader agree they
    may remove or replace an existing member of the Technical
    Committee.</P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<H3>6.3. Procedure</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <P>The Technical Committee uses the Standard Resolution
    Procedure.</P>

    <P>A draft resolution or amendment may be proposed by any member
    of the Technical Committee.  There is no minimum discussion period;
    the voting period lasts for up to one week, or until the outcome is
    no longer in doubt.  Members may change their votes.  There is a
    quorum of two.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Details regarding voting</P>

    <P>The Chairman has a casting vote.  When the Technical Committee
    votes whether to override a Developer who also happens to be a
    member of the Committee, that member may not vote (unless they are
    the Chairman, in which case they may use only their casting
    vote).</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Public discussion and decision-making.</P>

    <P>Discussion, draft resolutions and amendments, and votes by
    members of the committee, are made public on the Technical
    Committee public discussion list.  There is no separate secretary
    for the Committee.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Confidentiality of appointments.</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee may hold confidential discussions via
    private email or a private mailing list or other means to discuss
    appointments to the Committee.  However, votes on appointments must
    be public.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>No detailed design work.</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee does not engage in design of new
    proposals and policies.  Such design work should be carried out by
    individuals privately or together and discussed in ordinary
    technical policy and design forums.</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee restricts itself to choosing from or
    adopting compromises between solutions and decisions which have
    been proposed and reasonably thoroughly discussed elsewhere.</P>

    <P><CITE>Individual members of the technical committee may of
    course participate on their own behalf in any aspect of design and
    policy work.</CITE></P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Technical Committee makes decisions only as last resort.</P>

    <P>The Technical Committee does not make a technical decision
    until efforts to resolve it via consensus have been tried and
    failed, unless it has been asked to make a decision by the person
    or body who would normally be responsible for it.</P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<H2>7. The Project Secretary</H2>

<H3>7.1. Powers</H3>

<P>The Secretary:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>
    <P>Takes votes amongst the Developers, and determines the number
    and identity of Developers, whenever this is required by the
    constitution.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Can stand in for the Leader, together with the Chairman of the
    Technical Committee.</P>

    <P>If there is no Project Leader then the Chairman of the
    Technical Committee and the Project Secretary may by joint
    agreement make decisions if they consider it imperative to do
    so.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>Adjudicates any disputes about interpretation of the
    constitution.</P>
  </LI>

  <LI>
    <P>May delegate part or all of their authority to someone else, or
    withdraw such a delegation at any time.</P>
  </LI>
</OL>

<H3>7.2. Appointment</H3>

<P>The Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader and the
current Project Secretary.</P>

<P>If the Project Leader and the current Project Secretary cannot
agree on a new appointment they must ask the board of SPI to appoint a
Secretary.</P>

<P>If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then the
decision may be made or delegated by the Chairman of the Technical
Committee, as Acting Secretary.</P>

<P>The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point
they or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.</P>

<H3>7.3. Procedure</H3>

<P>The Project Secretary should make decisions which are fair and
reasonable, and preferably consistent with the consensus of the
Developers.</P>

<P>When acting together to stand in for an absent Project Leader the
Chairman of the Technical Committee and the Project Secretary should
make decisions only when absolutely necessary and only when consistent
with the consensus of the Developers.</P>

<H2>8. The Project Leader's Delegates</H2>

<H3>8.1. Powers</H3>

<P>The Project Leader's Delegates:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>have powers delegated to them by the Project Leader;</LI>

  <LI>may make certain decisions which the Leader may not make
  directly, including approving or expelling Developers or designating
  people as Developers who do not maintain packages.  <CITE>This is to
  avoid concentration of power, particularly over membership as a
  Developer, in the hands of the Project Leader.</CITE></LI>
</OL>

<H3>8.2. Appointment</H3>

<P>The Delegates are appointed by the Project Leader and may be
replaced by the Leader at the Leader's discretion.  The Project Leader
may not make the position as a Delegate conditional on particular
decisions by the Delegate, nor may they override a decision made by a
Delegate once made.</P>

<H3>8.3. Procedure</H3>

<P>Delegates may make decisions as they see fit, but should attempt to
implement good technical decisions and/or follow consensus opinion.</P>

<H2>9. Software in the Public Interest</H2>

<P>SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some goals.
Debian is grateful for the legal support framework offered by SPI.
<CITE>Debian's Developers are currently members of SPI by virtue of
their status as Developers.</CITE></P>

<H3>9.1. Authority</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>SPI has no authority regarding Debian's technical or nontechnical
  decisions, except that no decision by Debian with respect to any
  property held by SPI shall require SPI to act outside its legal
  authority, and that Debian's constitution may occasionally use SPI as
  a decision body of last resort.</LI>

  <LI>Debian claims no authority over SPI other than that over the use
  of certain of SPI's property, as described below, though Debian
  Developers may be granted authority within SPI by SPI's rules.</LI>

  <LI>Debian Developers are not agents or employees of SPI, or of each
  other or of persons in authority in the Debian Project.  A person
  acting as a Developer does so as an individual, on their own
  behalf.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>9.2. Management of property for purposes related to Debian</H3>

<P>Since Debian has no authority to hold money or property, any
donations for the Debian Project must made to SPI, which manages such
affairs.</P>

<P>SPI have made the following undertakings:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>SPI will hold money, trademarks and other tangible and intangible
  property and manage other affairs for purposes related to
  Debian.</LI>

  <LI>Such property will be accounted for separately and held in trust
  for those purposes, decided on by Debian and SPI according to this
  section.</LI>

  <LI>SPI will not dispose of or use property held in trust for Debian
  without approval from Debian, which may be granted by the Project
  Leader or by General Resolution of the Developers.</LI>

  <LI>SPI will consider using or disposing of property held in trust
  for Debian when asked to do so by the Project Leader.</LI>

  <LI>SPI will use or dispose of property held in trust for Debian when
  asked to do so by a General Resolution of the Developers, provided
  that this is compatible with SPI's legal authority.</LI>

  <LI>SPI will notify the Developers by electronic mail to a Debian
  Project mailing list when it uses or disposes of property held in
  trust for Debian.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>A. Standard Resolution Procedure</H2>

<P>These rules apply to communal decision-making by committees and
plebiscites, where stated above.</P>

<H3>A.1. Proposal</H3>

<P>The formal procedure begins when a draft resolution is proposed and
sponsored, as required.</P>

<H3>A.1. Discussion and Amendment</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>Following the proposal, the resolution may be discussed.
  Amendments may be made formal by being proposed and sponsored
  according to the requirements for a new resolution, or directly by
  the proposer of the original resolution.</LI>

  <LI>A formal amendment may be accepted by the resolution's proposer,
  in which case the formal resolution draft is immediately changed to
  match.</LI>

  <LI>If a formal amendment is not accepted, or one of the sponsors of
  the resolution does not agree with the acceptance by the proposer of
  a formal amendment, the amendment remains as an amendment and will be
  voted on.</LI>

  <LI>If an amendment accepted by the original proposer is not to the
  liking of others, they may propose another amendment to reverse the
  earlier change (again, they must meet the requirements for proposer
  and sponsor(s).)</LI>

  <LI>The proposer or a resolution may suggest changes to the wordings
  of amendments; these take effect if the proposer of the amendment
  agrees and none of the sponsors object.  In this case the changed
  amendments will be voted on instead of the originals.</LI>

  <LI>The proposer of a resolution may make changes to correct minor
  errors (for example, typographical errors or inconsistencies) or
  changes which do not alter the meaning, providing noone objects
  within 24 hours.  In this case the mininum discussion period is not
  restarted.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>A.2. Calling for a vote</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>The proposer or a sponsor of a motion or an amendment may call
  for a vote, providing that the minimum discussion period (if any) has
  elapsed.</LI>

  <LI>The proposer or a sponsor of a motion may call for a vote on any
  or all of the amendments individually or together; the proposer or
  sponsor of an amendment may call for a vote only on that amendment
  and related amendments.</LI>

  <LI>The person who calls for a vote states what they believe the
  wordings of the resolution and any relevant amendments are, and
  consequently what form the ballot should take.  However, the final
  decision on the form of ballot(s) is the Secretary's - see 7.1(1),
  7.1(3) and A.3(6).</LI>

  <LI>The minimum discussion period is counted from the time the last
  formal amendment was accepted, or the last related formal amendment
  was accepted if an amendment is being voted on, or since the whole
  resolution was proposed if no amendments have been proposed and
  accepted.</LI>
</OL>

<H3>A.3. Voting procedure</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>Each independent set of related amendments is voted on in a
  separate ballot.  Each such ballot has as options all the sensible
  combinations of amendments and options, and an option Further
  Discussion.  If Further Discussion wins then the entire resolution
  procedure is set back to the start of the discussion period.  No
  quorum is required for an amendment.</LI>

  <LI>When the final form of the resolution has been determined it is
  voted on in a final ballot, in which the options are Yes, No and
  Further Discussion.  If Further Discussion wins then the entire
  procedure is set back to the start of the discussion period.</LI>

  <LI>The vote taker (if there is one) or the voters (if voting is done
  by public pronouncement) may arrange for these ballots to be held
  simultaneously, even (for example) using a single voting message.  If
  amendment ballot(s) and the final ballot are combined in this way
  then it must be possible for a voter to vote differently in the final
  ballot for each of the possible forms of the final draft
  resolution.</LI>

  <LI>Votes may be cast during the voting period, as specified
  elsewhere.  If the voting period can end if the outcome is no longer
  in doubt, the possibility that voters may change their votes is not
  considered.</LI>

  <LI>The votes are counted according to the Concorde Vote Counting.  If
  a quorum is required then the default option is Further
  Discussion.</LI>

  <LI>In cases of doubt the Project Secretary shall decide on matters
  of procedure (for example, whether particular amendments should be
  considered independent or not).</LI>
</OL>

<H3>A.4. Withdrawing resolutions or unaccepted amendments</H3>

<P>The proposer of a resolution or unaccepted amendment may withdraw
it.  In this case new proposers may come forward keep it alive, in which
case the first person to do so becomes the new proposer and any others
become sponsors if they aren't sponsors already.</P>

<P>A sponsor of a resolution or amendment (unless it has been
accepted) may withdraw.</P>

<P>If the withdrawal of the proposer and/or sponsors means that a
resolution has no proposer or not enough sponsors it will not be voted
on unless this is rectified before the resolution expires.</P>

<H3>A.5. Expiry</H3>

<P>If a proposed resolution has not been discussed, amended, voted on
or otherwise dealt with for 4 weeks then it is considered to have been
withdrawn.</P>

<H3>A.6. Concorde Vote Counting</H3>

<OL>
  <LI>This is used to determine the winner amongst a list of options.
  Each ballot paper gives a ranking of the voter's preferred options.
  (The ranking need not be complete.)</LI>

  <LI>Option A is said to Dominate option B if strictly more ballots
  prefer A to B than prefer B to A.</LI>

  <LI>All options which are Dominated by at least one other option are
  discarded, and references to them in ballot papers will be
  ignored.</LI>

  <LI>If there is any option which Dominates all others then that is
  the winner.</LI>

  <LI>
    If there is now more than one option remaining Single Transferrable
    Vote will be applied to choose amongst those remaining:

    <UL>
      <LI>The number of first preferences for each option is counted,
      and if any option has more than half it is the winner.</LI>

      <LI>Otherwise the option with the lowest number of first
      preferences is eliminated and its votes redistributed according
      to the second preferences.</LI>

      <LI>This elimination procedure is repeated, moving down ballot
      papers to 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. preferences as required, until one
      option gets more than half of the `first' preferences.</LI>
    </UL>
  </LI>

  <LI>In the case of ties the elector with a casting vote will decide.
  The casting vote does not count as a normal vote; however that
  elector will usually also get a normal vote.</LI>

  <LI>If a supermajority is required the number of Yes votes in the
  final ballot is reduced by an appropriate factor.  Strictly speaking,
  for a supermajority of F:A, the number of ballots which prefer Yes to
  X (when considering whether Yes Dominates X or X Dominates Yes) or
  the number of ballots whose first (remaining) preference is Yes (when
  doing STV comparisons for winner and elimination purposes) is
  multiplied by a factor A/F before the comparison is done.  <CITE>This
  means that a 2:1 vote, for example, means twice as many people voted
  for as against; abstentions are not counted.</CITE></LI>

  <LI>If a quorum is required, there must be at least that many votes
  which prefer the winning option to the default option.  If there are
  not then the default option wins after all.  For votes requiring a
  supermajority, the actual number of Yes votes is used when checking
  whether the quorum has been reached.</LI>

<P><CITE>When the Standard Resolution Procedure is to be used, the text
which refers to it must specify what is sufficient to have a draft
resolution proposed and/or sponsored, what the minimum discussion
period is, and what the voting period is.  It must also specify any
supermajority and/or the quorum (and default option) to be
used.</CITE></P>

<P>The present indicative (`is', for example) means that the statement
is a rule in this constitution.  `May' or `can' indicates that the
person or body has discretion.  `Should' means that it would be
considered a good thing if the sentence were obeyed, but it is not
binding.  <CITE>Text marked as a citation, such as this, is rationale
and does not form part of the constitution.  It may be used only to aid
interpretation in cases of doubt.</CITE></P>
