    <h1>Ｄｅｂｉａｎ 計劃憲章（版本 １．０）</h1>
    
    <h2>１．導引</h2>

    <cite>Ｄｅｂｉａｎ 計劃（Debian Project）是由一群致力於發展一個自由作業系統的人仕組成的組織。
    </cite>

    <p>

    本文陳述決策本計劃事務的組織架構。這裡不會描述計劃的目標及達到此目標的\
    方法，亦不會涉及任何有關行政上的資料，除非與決策過程有直接關係。

    <h2>２．決策團體及個人</h2>
    
    <p>計劃的每一個決定是由以下一個或多個的項目制定：

    <ol>
      <li>開發人員 (developer)，經由全民決議 (General Resolution) 或投票；
      <li>計劃領袖 (Project Leader)；
      <li>技術委員會 (Technical Committee) 和／或技術委員會的主席 (Chairman)；
#      The individual Developer working on a particular task;
      <li>某一特定工作中的開發人員；
      <li>被計劃領袖委派為某一特定工作的代表 (delegate)；
#      Delegates appointed by the Project Leader for specific tasks.
      <li>計劃秘書 (Project Secretary)
    </ol>
    
    本文件的大部份內容將會用來概述這些體系的權力，他們的組成和工作，及\
    他們決策時的程序。某人或團體的權力有可能會受到調查和／或受到別人所\
    限，在這個情況下，進行調查的人員會有所交代。<cite>在以上的列表當中\
    ，能夠被否決的個人或團體通常是放在否決者之下，被委任人或團體也通常\
    是放在委任者（或協助委任者）之下 ─ 但不是所有列在前面的也能否決在\
    後面的。</cite>

    <h3>２．１ 一般規則</h3>

    <ol>
      <li><p>
    這憲章並沒有強迫任何人去為本計劃工作。於某人不願意做一個曾被委任給\
    他的工作，他是不需要去做的。但他們不能積極地違反這些規則，以及在這\
    些規則之下達成的決定。
       </p><li><p>
    一人可以擁有多個職位，計劃領袖例外。秘書及技術委員會主席不能是同一\
    人，計劃領袖亦不能委派他們成為他們自己的代表。
      </p><li><p>
        任何人仕只要公開聲明，就可以隨時離開本計劃或辭退他所擁有的職位。
    </ol>

    <h2>３．個別開發人員</h2>

    <h3>３．１．權力</h3>

    個別開發人員可以
    <ol>
      <li>對自己的工作進行技術性或非技術性的決定；
      <li>建議或提出全民決議草案；
      <li>自薦為計劃領袖候選人；
      <li>在全民決議和領袖選舉中投票。
    </ol>

    <h3>３．２．組成及工作</h3>

    <ol><li><p>
    開發人員為願意在他們參與的期間推動計劃目標的志願工作者，他們亦會\
    為計劃維護軟件套件／軟件包 (package) 或領袖代表認為值得進行的其他工作。

    </p><li><p>
    計劃領袖委派的代表可能會選擇不接受新的開發人員，又或開除現任的開\
    發人員。<cite>如開發人員認為代表濫用職權，當然，他們可以利用全民決\
    議來凌駕那些決定 ─ 詳見 s.4.1(3), s.4.2。</cite>

    </ol>

    <h3>３．３．程序</h3>

    <P>開發人員如果認為恰當，他們可以隨時作出這些決定。
#    Developers may make these decisions as they see fit.

    <h2>４．The Developers by way of General Resolution or election</h2>

    <h3>４．１．權力</h3>

    總括來說，開發人員可以：
    <ol>
      <li><p>任命或召回計劃領袖。
	</p>
      <li><p>修改憲章，只要有 ３：１ 的大多數同意他們。
	</p>
      <li><p>拒絕接受計劃領袖或代表的任何決定。
	</p>
      <li><p>拒絕接受技術委員會的任何決定，只要有 ２：１ 的大多數同意他們。
	</p>
      <li><p>分發非技術性的政策文件及聲明。
	<p>
      這類文件包括有描述本計劃目標的，與其他自由軟件團體\ #entity
      的關係的，以及非技術性政策的，如 Debian 的軟件必需要符合的自由軟件\
      許可證條款 (licence terms)。
	<p>
      文件亦可以是有關當時熱門話題的立場聲明。
	</p>
      <li><p>與計劃領袖及 SPI 作出一些關於為 Debian 而受委托代管的財產的\
      決定。（s.9.1）
    </ol>
    
    <h3>４．２．程序</h3>
    <ol><li><p>
      開發人員需要根據以下敘述的一般議決程序 (Standard Resolution Procedure)\
      。如要提出議決或修改， 任何的一名開發人員可以提議，但要得到至少 K \
      名其他的開發人員保證 (sponsor)，又或是由計劃領袖或技術委員會提議。
    </p><li><p>延遲計劃領袖或其代表的決策：
    <ol><li>如計劃領袖或其代表，又或技術委員會作出了一個決策，\
            開發人員可以利用通過議決的方式來推翻他們的決定；見 s4.1(3)。
    <li>
      如議決得到至少 2K 名開發人員的保證，又或是由技術委員會建議的；\
      若議決要求將是項決定凍結，那麼是項決定將被立即凍結。
    <li>
      如原來的決策是要求更改討論的期限或投票的期限，又或者議決是要求推翻\
      技術委員會的決策，在這樣的情況下只需要 K 名的開發人員去保證議決來\
      凍結是項決策。
    <li>
#      決策被凍結後，投票將會立即進行來決定是項決策是否
      If the decision is put on hold, an immediate vote is held to
      determine whether the decision will stand until the full vote on
      the decision is made or whether the implementation of the
      original decision will be be delayed until then.  There is no
      quorum for this immediate procedural vote.
    <li>
      如計劃領袖（或其代表）收回原先的決策，投票雖未有結果，但亦不會繼續進行。
    </ol>
    </p><li><p>
      投票是有計劃秘書處理。票數和統計是不會在投票進行中發表的；投票\
      結束後，計劃秘書將會列出所有投過的票。投票時期為兩星期，但計劃\
      領袖可將它加減一星期。當投票的結果可以被確定的時候，計劃秘書亦\
      可將投票終止。
    </p><li><p>
      最短的討論時期為兩星期，但計劃領袖可將它加減一星期。計劃領袖\
      擁有一決定票。法定人數為３Ｑ。
    </p><li><p>
      建議，保證，修改，投票通知，和其他正式的行動需要由計劃領袖的代表，\
      在公開的電子郵遞列表中作出宣布；任何開發人員可以在那裡發表言論。
    </p><li><p>
      投票是利用電子郵件，並在適合秘書的方式下進行。\
      每個選舉中已投的票可否更改則視乎秘書的決定。
    </p><li><p>
      Ｑ是目前開發人員數目的平方根的一半。Ｋ是Ｑ或５中較細的一個。\
      Ｑ和Ｋ都不需要是整數，也不需要四捨五入。
    </ol>

    <h2>５．計劃領袖</h2>

    <h3>５．１．權力</h3>

    計劃領袖可以：
    <ol>
      <li>委任代表 (Delegates) 或將決定付托給技術委員會。
	<p>
      計劃領袖可以定義一個範圍用以函括一些執行中的職務，又或定義\
      一個特定的決定，並把它交托給另一名開發人員或技術委員會。
	<p>
      當做了一個決定並被委派了的時候，計劃領袖不可撤銷此委任；\
      惟他們可以撤銷一個進行中的職務範圍之委任。
	</p>
      <li><p>向其他開發人員作出正式的支持
	<p>
      計劃領袖可以制訂支持某些觀點或計劃中其他成員的聲明，無論是被要求與否；\
      這些聲明只是當計劃領袖被授權作某問題的決定時才真正有力。
	</p>
      <li><p>制定需要逼切行動的決定
	<p>
      不適用於由於缺乏適當行動而漸變成逼切的決定，除非時限已定。
	</p>
      <li><p>制定任何人也不需要負責的決定。
	</p>
      <li><p>提出全民決議草案及修訂。
	</p>
      <li><p>與技術委員會共同委任委員會的新成員。（見 s.6.2.）
	</p>
      <li>當開發人員投票時投出決定票。
	<p>
      計劃領袖亦同時擁有一次普通的投票。
	</p>
      <li><p>更改開發人員投票的討論階段期限（如上）。
	</p>
      <li><p>帶領開發人員進行討論。
	<p>
      計劃領袖在參與開發人員中的討論的時候應嘗試協助討論集中於\
      討論的重點問題。計劃領袖不應利用他的領導身份來提倡自己的\
      個人觀點。
	</p>
      <li><p>與 SPI 共同制訂與 Debian 有關的信托資產。（見 s.9.1）
    </ol>

    <h3>5.2. Appointment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	The Project Leader is elected by the Developers.
      <li>
	The election begins nine weeks before the leadership post becomes
	vacant, or (if it is too late already) immediately.
      <li>
	For the following three weeks any Developer may nominate themselves as
	a candidate Project Leader.
      <li>
	For three weeks after that no more candidates may be nominated;
	candidates should use this time for campaigning (to make their
	identities and positions known).  If there are no candidates
	at the end of the nomination period then the nomination period
	is extended for three further weeks, repeatedly if necessary.
      <li>
	The next three weeks are the polling period during which
	Developers may cast their votes.  Votes in leadership
	elections are kept secret, even after the election is
	finished.
      <li>
	The options on the ballot will be those candidates who have
	nominated themselves and have not yet withdrawn, plus None Of
	The Above.  If None Of The Above wins the election then the
	election procedure is repeated, many times if necessary.
      <li>The decision will be made using Concorde Vote Counting.
        The quorum is the same as for a General Resolution
	(s.4.2) and the default option is None Of The Above.
      <li>
	The Project Leader serves for one year from their election.
    </ol>

    <h3>5.3. Procedure</h3>
    <p>
      The Project Leader should attempt to make decisions which are
      consistent with the consensus of the opinions of the Developers.
    <p>
      Where practical the Project Leader should informally solicit the views
      of the Developers.
    <p>
      The Project Leader should avoid overemphasizing their own point
      of view when making decisions in their capacity as Leader.

    <h2>6. Technical committee</h2>

    <h3>6.1. Powers</h3>

    The Technical Committee may:
    <ol>
      <li>Decide on any matter of technical policy.
	<p>
	  This includes the contents of the technical policy manuals,
	  developers' reference materials, example packages and the
	  behaviour of non-experimental package building tools.  (In
          each case the usual maintainer of the relevant software or
          documentation makes decisions initially, however; see
          6.3(5).)
	</p>
      <li>Decide any technical matter where Developers' jurisdictions overlap.
	<p>
	  In cases where Developers need to implement compatible
	  technical policies or stances (for example, if they disagree
	  about the priorities of conflicting packages, or about
	  ownership of a command name, or about which package is
	  responsible for a bug that both maintainers agree is a bug,
	  or about who should be the maintainer for a package) the
	  technical committee may decide the matter.
	</p>
      <li><p>Make a decision when asked to do so.
	<p>
	  Any person or body may delegate a decision of their own to
	  the Technical Committee, or seek advice from it.
	</p>
      <li><p>Overrule a Developer (requires a 3:1 majority).
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee may ask a Developer to take a
	  particular technical course of action even if the Developer
	  does not wish to; this requires a 3:1 majority.  For
	  example, the Committee may determine that a complaint made
	  by the submitter of a bug is justified and that the
	  submitter's proposed solution should be implemented.
	</p>
      <li><p>
	Offer advice.
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee may make formal announcements about
	  its views on any matter.  <cite>Individual members may of
	  course make informal statements about their views and about
	  the likely views of the committee.</cite>
	</p>
      <li><p>Together with the Project Leader, appoint new members to
	itself or remove existing members.  (See s.6.2.)
	</p>
      <li><p>Appoint the Chairman of the Technical Committee.
	<p>
	  The Chairman is elected by the Committee from its members.
	  All members of the committee are automatically nominated;
	  the committee vote starting one week before the post will
	  become vacant (or immediately, if it is already too late).
	  The members may vote by public acclamation for any fellow
	  committee member, including themselves; there is no None Of
	  The Above option.  The vote finishes when all the members
	  have voted or when the outcome is no longer in doubt.  The
	  result is determined according to Concorde Vote Counting.
	</p>
      <li>The Chairman can stand in for the Leader, together with the Secretary
	<p>
	  As detailed in s.7.1(2), the Chairman of the Technical
	  Committee and the Project Secretary may together stand in
	  for the Leader if there is no Leader.
    </ol>

    <h3>6.2. Composition</h3>
    <ol><li><p>
      The Technical Committee consists of up to 8 Developers, and should
      usually have at least 4 members.
    </p><li><p>
      When there are fewer than 8 members the Technical Committee may
      recommend new member(s) to the Project Leader, who may choose
      (individually) to appoint them or not.
    </p><li><p>
      When there are 5 members or fewer the Technical Committee may appoint
      new member(s) until the number of members reaches 6.
    </p><li><p>
      When there have been 5 members or fewer for at least one week
      the Project Leader may appoint new member(s) until the number of
      members reaches 6, at intervals of at least one week per
      appointment.
    </p><li><p>
      If the Technical Committee and the Project Leader agree they may
      remove or replace an existing member of the Technical Committee.
    </ol>

    <h3>6.3. Procedure</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>The Technical Committee uses the Standard Resolution Procedure.
	<p>
	  A draft resolution or amendment may be proposed by any
	  member of the Technical Committee.  There is no minimum
	  discussion period; the voting period lasts for up to one
          week, or until the outcome is no longer in doubt.  Members
          may change their votes.  There is a quorum of two.
	</p>
      <li>Details regarding voting
	<p>
	  The Chairman has a casting vote.  When the Technical
	  Committee votes whether to override a Developer who also
	  happens to be a member of the Committee, that member may not
	  vote (unless they are the Chairman, in which case they may
	  use only their casting vote).
	</p>
      <li>Public discussion and decisionmaking.
	<p>
	  Discussion, draft resolutions and amendments, and votes by
	  members of the committee, are made public on the Technical
	  Committee public discussion list.  There is no separate
	  secretary for the Committee. 
	</p>
     <li>
	Confidentiality of appointments.
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee may hold confidential discussions
	  via private email or a private mailing list or other means
	  to discuss appointments to the Committee.  However, votes on
	  appointments must be public.
	</p>
      <li>
	No detailed design work.
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee does not engage in design of new proposals
	  and policies.  Such design work should be carried out by individuals
	  privately or together and discussed in ordinary technical policy and
	  design forums.
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee restricts itself to choosing from
	  or adopting compromises between solutions and decisions which have
	  been proposed and reasonably thoroughly discussed elsewhere.
	<p>
	<cite>Individual members of the technical committee may of course
          participate on their own behalf in any aspect of design and
          policy work.</cite>          
	</p>
      <li>Technical Committee makes decisions only as last resort.
	<p>
	  The Technical Committee does not make a technical decision
	  until efforts to resolve it via consensus have been tried
	  and failed, unless it has been asked to make a decision by
          the person or body who would normally be responsible for it.
    </ol>

    <h2>7. The Project Secretary</h2>

    <h3>7.1. Powers</h3>

    The Secretary:
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
	  Takes votes amongst the Developers, and determines the
          number and identity of Developers, whenever this is required
          by the constitution.
	</p>
      <li>
        <p>
	  Can stand in for the Leader, together with the Chairman of
	  the Technical Committee.
	<p>
	  If there is no Project Leader then the Chairman of the
	  Technical Committee and the Project Secretary may by
	  joint agreement make decisions if they consider it
	  imperative to do so.
	</p>
      <li>
	<p>
          Adjudicates any disputes about interpretation of the
	  constitution.
	</p>
      <li>
        <p>
          May delegate part or all of their authority to someone else,
          or withdraw such a delegation at any time.
    </ol>

    <h3>7.2. Appointment</h3>
    <p>
      The Project Secretary is appointed by the Project Leader and the
      current Project Secretary.
    <p>
      If the Project Leader and the current Project Secretary cannot
      agree on a new appointment they must ask the board of SPI to
      appoint a Secretary.
    <p>
      If there is no Project Secretary or the current Secretary is
      unavailable and has not delegated authority for a decision then
      the decision may be made or delegated by the Chairman of the
      Technical Committee, as Acting Secretary.
    <p>
      The Project Secretary's term of office is 1 year, at which point
      they or another Secretary must be (re)appointed.

    <h3>7.3. Procedure</h3>

    The Project Secretary should make decisions which are fair and
    reasonable, and preferably consistent with the consensus of the
    Developers.
    <p>

    When acting together to stand in for an absent Project Leader the
    Chairman of the Technical Committee and the Project Secretary
    should make decisions only when absolutely necessary and only when
    consistent with the consensus of the Developers.
      
    <h2>8. The Project Leader's Delegates</h2>

    <h3>8.1. Powers</h3>

    The Project Leader's Delegates:
    <ol>
      <li>have powers delegated to them by the Project Leader;
      <li>may make certain decisions which the Leader may not make
	directly, including approving or expelling Developers or
	designating people as Developers who do not maintain packages.
	<cite>
	  This is to avoid concentration of power, particularly over
	  membership as a Developer, in the hands of the Project
	  Leader.
	</cite>
    </ol>

    <h3>8.2. Appointment</h3>
    
    The Delegates are appointed by the Project Leader and may be
    replaced by the Leader at the Leader's discretion.  The Project
    Leader may not make the position as a Delegate conditional on
    particular decisions by the Delegate, nor may they override a
    decision made by a Delegate once made.

    <h3>8.3. Procedure</h3>

    Delegates may make decisions as they see fit, but should attempt
    to implement good technical decisions and/or follow consensus
    opinion.

    <h2>9. Software in the Public Interest</h2>

    SPI and Debian are separate organisations who share some goals.
    Debian is grateful for the legal support framework offered by SPI.
    <cite>
      Debian's Developers are currently members of SPI by virtue
      of their status as Developers.
    </cite>
    
    <h3>9.1. Authority</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	SPI has no authority regarding Debian's technical or
	nontechnical decisions, except that no decision by Debian with
	respect to any property held by SPI shall require SPI to act
	outside its legal authority, and that Debian's constitution
	may occasionally use SPI as a decision body of last resort.
      <li>
	Debian claims no authority over SPI other than that over the
	use of certain of SPI's property, as described below, though
	Debian Developers may be granted authority within SPI by SPI's
	rules.
      <li>
        Debian Developers are not agents or employees of SPI, or of
        each other or of persons in authority in the Debian Project.
        A person acting as a Developer does so as an individual, on
        their own behalf.
    </ol>

    <h3>9.2. Management of property for purposes related to Debian</h3>
        Since Debian has no authority to hold money or property, any
	donations for the Debian Project must made to SPI, which
	manages such affairs.
	<p>
	SPI have made the following undertakings:
    <ol>
      <li>
	SPI will hold money, trademarks and other tangible and
	intangible property and manage other affairs for purposes
	related to Debian.
      <li>
	Such property will be accounted for separately and held in
	trust for those purposes, decided on by Debian and SPI
	according to this section.
      <li>
	SPI will not dispose of or use property held in trust for
	Debian without approval from Debian, which may be granted by
	the Project Leader or by General Resolution of the Developers.
      <li>
	SPI will consider using or disposing of property held in trust
	for Debian when asked to do so by the Project Leader.
      <li>
	SPI will use or dispose of property held in trust for Debian
	when asked to do so by a General Resolution of the Developers,
	provided that this is compatible with SPI's legal authority.
      <li>
        SPI will notify the Developers by electronic mail to a
	Debian Project mailing list when it uses or disposes of
	property held in trust for Debian.
    </ol>

    <h2>A. Standard Resolution Procedure</h2>

    These rules apply to communal decisionmaking by committees and
    plebiscites, where stated above.

    <h3>A.1. Proposal</h3>

    The formal procedure begins when a draft resolution is proposed and
    sponsored, as required.

    <h3>A.1. Discussion and Amendment</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Following the proposal, the resolution may be discussed.
	Amendments may be made formal by being proposed and sponsored
	according to the requirements for a new resolution, or
	directly by the proposer of the original resolution.
      <li>
	A formal amendment may be accepted by the resolution's
	proposer, in which case the formal resolution draft is
	immediately changed to match.
      <li>
	If a formal amendment is not accepted, or one of the sponsors
	of the resolution does not agree with the acceptance by the
	proposer of a formal amendment, the amendment remains as an
	amendment and will be voted on.
      <li>
	If an amendment accepted by the original proposer is not to
	the liking of others, they may propose another amendment to
	reverse the earlier change (again, they must meet the
	requirements for proposer and sponsor(s).)
      <li>
    The proposer or a resolution may suggest changes to the
    wordings of amendments; these take effect if the proposer of
    the amendment agrees and none of the sponsors object.  In
    this case the changed amendments will be voted on instead of
    the originals.
	  <li>
	The proposer of a resolution may make changes to correct minor
	errors (for example, typographical errors or inconsistencies) or
	changes which do not alter the meaning, providing noone objects
	within 24 hours.  In this case the mininum discussion period is not
	restarted.
    </ol>

    <h3>A.2. Calling for a vote</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	The proposer or a sponsor of a motion or an amendment may call for a vote,
	providing that the minimum discussion period (if any) has
	elapsed.
      <li>
	The proposer or a sponsor of a motion may call for a vote on any
	or all of the amendments individually or together; the
	proposer or sponsor of an amendment may call for a vote only on that
	amendment and related amendments.
      <li>
        The person who calls for a vote states what they believe the
        wordings of the resolution and any relevant amendments are,
        and consequently what form the ballot should take.  However,
        the final decision on the form of ballot(s) is the Secretary's
        - see 7.1(1), 7.1(3) and A.3(6).
      <li>
	The minimum discussion period is counted from the time the
	last formal amendment was accepted, or the last related formal
	amendment was accepted if an amendment is being voted on, or
	since the whole resolution was proposed if no amendments have
	been proposed and accepted.
    </ol>

    <h3>A.3. Voting procedure</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	Each independent set of related amendments is voted on in a
	separate ballot.  Each such ballot has as options all the
	sensible combinations of amendments and options, and an option
	Further Discussion.  If Further Discussion wins then the
	entire resolution procedure is set back to the start of the
	discussion period.  No quorum is required for an amendment.
      <li>
	When the final form of the resolution has been determined it
	is voted on in a final ballot, in which the options are Yes,
	No and Further Discussion.  If Further Discussion wins then
	the entire procedure is set back to the start of the
	discussion period.
      <li>
	The vote taker (if there is one) or the voters (if voting is
	done by public pronouncement) may arrange for these ballots to
	be held simultaneously, even (for example) using a single
	voting message.  If amendment ballot(s) and the final ballot
	are combined in this way then it must be possible for a voter
	to vote differently in the final ballot for each of the
	possible forms of the final draft resolution.
      <li>
        Votes may be cast during the voting period, as specified
        elsewhere.  If the voting period can end if the outcome is no
        longer in doubt, the possibility that voters may change their
        votes is not considered.
      <li>
	The votes are counted according to the Concorde Vote
        Counting.  If a quorum is required then the default option
        is Further Discussion.
      <li>
	In cases of doubt the Project Secretary shall decide on
	matters of procedure (for example, whether particular
	amendments should be considered independent or not).
    </ol>

    <h3>A.4. Withdrawing resolutions or unaccepted amendments</h3>

    The proposer of a resolution or unaccepted amendment may withdraw
    it.  In this case new proposers may come forward keep it alive, in
    which case the first person to do so becomes the new proposer and
    any others become sponsors if they aren't sponsors already.

    <p>
    
    A sponsor of a resolution or amendment (unless it has been
    accepted) may withdraw.

    <p>

    If the withdrawal of the proposer and/or sponsors means that a
    resolution has no proposer or not enough sponsors it will not be
    voted on unless this is rectified before the resolution expires.

    <h3>A.5. Expiry</h3>

    If a proposed resolution has not been discussed, amended, voted on
    or otherwise dealt with for 4 weeks then it is considered to have
    been withdrawn.
    
    <h3>A.6. Concorde Vote Counting</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
	This is used to determine the winner amongst a list of
	options.  Each ballot paper gives a ranking of the voter's
	preferred options.  (The ranking need not be complete.)
      <li>
	Option A is said to Dominate option B if strictly more ballots
	prefer A to B than prefer B to A.
      <li>
	All options which are Dominated by at least one other option
	are discarded, and references to them in ballot papers will be
	ignored.
      <li>
	If there is any option which Dominates all others then that is
	the winner.
      <li>
	If there is now more than one option remaining Single
	Transferrable Vote will be applied to choose amongst those
	remaining:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    The number of first preferences for each option is
	    counted, and if any option has more than half it is the
	    winner.
	  <li>
	    Otherwise the option with the lowest number of first
	    preferences is eliminated and its votes redistributed
	    according to the second preferences.
	  <li>
	    This elimination procedure is repeated, moving down ballot
	    papers to 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc. preferences as required,
	    until one option gets more than half of the `first'
	    preferences.
	</ul>
      <li>
	In the case of ties the elector with a casting vote will
	decide.  The casting vote does not count as a normal vote;
	however that elector will usually also get a normal vote.
      <li>
	If a supermajority is required the number of Yes votes in the
	final ballot is reduced by an appropriate factor.  Strictly
	speaking, for a supermajority of F:A, the number of ballots
	which prefer Yes to X (when considering whether Yes Dominates
	X or X Dominates Yes) or the number of ballots whose first
	(remaining) preference is Yes (when doing STV comparisons for
	winner and elimination purposes) is multiplied by a factor A/F
	before the comparison is done.
	<cite>
	This means that a 2:1 vote, for example, means twice as many
        people voted for as against; abstentions are not counted.
	</cite>
      <li>
        If a quorum is required, there must be at least that many votes
	which prefer the winning option to the default option.  If
	there are not then the default option wins after all.  For
	votes requiring a supermajority, the actual number of Yes
	votes is used when checking whether the quorum has been
	reached.
    </ol>

    <cite>When the Standard Resolution Procedure is to be used, the text
    which refers to it must specify what is sufficient to have a draft
    resolution proposed and/or sponsored, what the minimum discussion
    period is, and what the voting period is.  It must also specify
    any supermajority and/or the quorum (and default option) to be
    used.</cite>

    <h2>B. Use of language and typography</h2>

    The present indicative (`is', for example) means that the
    statement is a rule in this constitution.  `May' or `can' indicates
    that the person or body has discretion.  `Should' means that it
    would be considered a good thing if the sentence were obeyed, but
    it is not binding.

    <cite> Text marked as a citation, such as this, is rationale and
    does not form part of the constitution.  It may be used only to
    aid interpretation in cases of doubt.  </cite>
