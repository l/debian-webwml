#use wml::debian::template title="Updates to Debian 2.0"

<P>Several packages in Debian 2.0 have been updated since its release
on July 24th to reflect security enhancements and other changes too
important to leave until the next major release.

<P>Debian is committed to providing security updates to the stable
distribution as quickly as possible, but we also need time to thoroughly
test such updates to ensure that they meet our high standards.

<P>Those who wish to assist in the testing process or feel that a
particular vulnerability is too critical to wait for Debian's own testing
process may retrieve updated packages from the
<a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/proposed-updates/">proposed-updates</a>
distribution.  Those using the new package tool <EM>apt</EM> may wish
to add the following line to their <TT>/etc/apt/sources.list</TT> file
to faciliatate easy upgrades to the newer packages, changing the URI as
appropriate:

<blockquote>
<TT>deb http://ftp1.us.debian.org/debian dists/proposed-updates/</TT>
</blockquote>
