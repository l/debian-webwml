<A NAME="4322"></A><A NAME="4323"></A><A NAME="4324"></A>This appendix describes what happens during the GNU/Linux boot process. 

<P>
How you boot your system depends on how you set things up when you installed
Debian. Most likely, you just turn the computer on. But you may have to insert
a floppy disk first. 

<P>
Linux is loaded by a program called LILO, or LInux LOader. LILO can also load
other operating systems and ask you which system you'd like to load. 

<P>
The first thing that happens when you turn on an Intel PC is that the BIOS executes.
BIOS <A NAME="4325"></A><A NAME="4326"></A><A NAME="4327"></A>stands for Basic Input Output System. It's a program permanently stored
in the computer on read-only chips. It performs some minimal tests and then
looks for a floppy disk in the first disk drive. If it finds one, it looks for
a ``boot sector'' on that disk and starts executing code from it, if there
is any. If there is a disk but no boot sector, the BIOS will print a message
like this: <TT>Non-system&nbsp;disk&nbsp;or&nbsp;disk&nbsp;error</TT>. Removing the disk and pressing
a key will cause the boot process to resume. 

<P>
If there isn't a floppy disk in the drive, the BIOS looks for a master boot
record (MBR) on the hard disk. It will start executing the code found there,
which loads the operating system. On GNU/Linux systems, LILO can occupy the
MBR and will load GNU/Linux. 

<P>
Thus, if you opted to install LILO on your hard drive, you should see the word
<TT>LILO</TT> as your computer starts up. At that point, you can press the left
<TT>Shift</TT> key to select which operating system to load or press <TT>Tab</TT>
to see a list of options. Type in one of those options and press <TT>Enter</TT>.
LILO will boot the requested operating system. <A NAME="4333"></A>

<P>
If you don't press the <TT>Shift</TT> key, LILO will automatically load the
default operating system after about 5 seconds. If you like, you can change
what system LILO loads automatically, which systems it knows how to load, and
how long it waits before loading one automatically. 

<P>
If you didn't install LILO on your hard drive, you probably created a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">boot
disk</SPAN>. <A NAME="4336"></A>The boot disk will have LILO on it. All you have to do is insert the
disk before you turn on your computer, and the BIOS will find it before it checks
the MBR on the hard drive. To return to a non-Linux OS, take out the boot disk
and restart the computer. From Linux, be sure you follow the proper procedure
for restarting; see section <A HREF="node8_ct.html#shutdown">4.5</A> on page <A HREF="node8_ct.html#shutdown"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A> for
details.

<P>
LILO loads the <A NAME="4339"></A>Linux kernel from disk and then lets the kernel take over. (The
kernel is the central program of the operating system, which is in control of
all other programs.) The kernel discards the BIOS and LILO.

<P>
On non-Intel platforms, things work a little differently. But once you boot,
everything is more or less the same.

<P>
<A NAME="4340"></A><A NAME="4341"></A>Linux looks at the type of hardware it's running on. It wants to know what type
of hard disks you have, whether or not you have a bus mouse, whether or not
you're on a network, and other bits of trivia like that. Linux can't remember
things between boots, so it has to ask these questions each time it starts up.
Luckily, it isn't asking <SPAN  CLASS="textit">you</SPAN> these questions - it's asking the hardware!
While it boots, the Linux kernel will print messages on the screen describing
what it's doing.

<P>
The query process<A NAME="4343"></A><A NAME="4344"></A><A NAME="4345"></A> can cause problems with your system, but if it was going to,
it probably would have when you first installed GNU/Linux. If you're having
problems, consult the installation instructions or ask questions on a mailing
list.

<P>
The kernel merely manages other programs, so once it is satisfied everything
is okay, it must start another program to do anything useful. The program the
kernel starts is called <TT>init</TT>. After the kernel starts <TT>init</TT>,
it never starts another program. The kernel becomes a manager and a provider
of services.

<P>
Once <TT>init</TT> is started, it runs a number of scripts (files containing
commands), which prepare the system to be used. They do some routine maintenance
and start up a lot of programs that do things like display a login prompt, listen
for network connections, and keep a log of the computer's activities.
