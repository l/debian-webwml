<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Logging In</A>
</H1>

<P>
Your system is now installed! Pat yourself on the back for a job well done!
Now it's time to start using the system. In this chapter, we introduce you to
the Debian command line, some security principles, and how to exit the system.
In later chapters, we'll go into more detail on these topics and introduce you
to the Debian graphical interface, X11.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION04410000000000000000">
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN> First Steps</A>
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="1322"></A><A NAME="1323"></A><A NAME="1324"></A><A NAME="1325"></A><A NAME="1326"></A>After you quit <TT>dselect</TT>, you'll be presented with the <TT>login:</TT>
prompt.  You can now log in using the personal login and password you selected;
your system is now ready to use. Let's examine what it means to log in and how
this process works.

<P>
To use Debian, you must identify yourself to the system. This is so it knows
who you are, what you have permission to do, and what your preferences are. 

<P>
To this end, you have a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">username</SPAN> or <SPAN  CLASS="textit">login</SPAN>. If you installed
Debian yourself, you should have been asked to give such a name during installation.
If you are logging on to a system administered by someone else, you'll have
to ask him for an account on the system and a corresponding username.

<P>
You also have a password, so no one else can pretend to be you. If you don't
have a password, anyone can log on to your computer from the Internet and do
bad things. If you're worried about security, you should have a password.

<P>
Many people prefer to trust others not to do anything malicious with their account;
hopefully your work environment doesn't encourage paranoia. This is a perfectly
reasonable attitude; it depends on your personal priorities and your environment.
Obviously a home system does not need to be as secure as a military installation.
Debian allows you to be as secure or as insecure as you like. 

<P>
<A NAME="1331"></A><A NAME="1332"></A><A NAME="1333"></A><A NAME="1334"></A><A NAME="1335"></A>When you start Debian, you'll see a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">prompt</SPAN>: a request from the computer
for some information. In this case, the prompt is <TT>login:</TT>. 

<P>
You should type your username and, when requested, your password. The password
does not appear on the screen as you type it. Press <TT>Enter</TT> after both
the username and the password. If you type your username or password incorrectly,
you'll have to start over. 

<P>
If you do it correctly, you'll see a brief message and then a <TT>$</TT> prompt.
The <TT>$</TT> is printed by a special program called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">shell</SPAN> and
is thus called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">shell prompt</SPAN><A NAME="1343"></A>. This is where you give commands to the
system. 

<P>
<A NAME="1344"></A><A NAME="1345"></A><A NAME="1346"></A>Try entering the command <TT>whoami</TT> now. There is a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">cursor</SPAN> to
the right of the shell prompt. Your cursor is a small underscore or rectangle
that indicates where you're typing; it should move as you type. Always press
<TT>Enter</TT> when you're done typing a shell command. 

<P>
<TT>whoami</TT> tells your username. You'll then get a new shell prompt. 

<P>
For the rest of the book, when we say to enter a command, you should type it
at the shell prompt and press the <TT>Enter</TT> key.

<P>
When you're done working, you may want to log out of the system. To exit the
shell, enter the <TT>exit</TT> command. Keep in mind that if you remain logged
in, someone could come along and use your account. Hopefully you can trust those
in your office or home not to do this; but if you do not trust your environment,
you should be certain to log out when you leave.

<P>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">2</SPAN> Command History and Editing the
<BR>
Command Line
</H1>

<P>
Whatever you type after the shell prompt and before pressing <TT>Enter</TT>
is called a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">command line</SPAN>. It's a line of text that commands the computer
to do something. <A NAME="1357"></A><A NAME="1358"></A><A NAME="1359"></A>The Debian default shell offers several features to make entering
command lines easy.

<P>
<A NAME="1360"></A><A NAME="1361"></A><A NAME="1362"></A><A NAME="1363"></A><A NAME="1364"></A><A NAME="1365"></A>You can scroll up to previous commands to run them again, or you can modify
them slightly and <SPAN  CLASS="textit">then</SPAN> run them again. Try this: Enter any command,
such as <TT>whoami</TT>; then press the <TT>Up&nbsp;Arrow</TT> key. The <TT>whoami</TT>
command will reappear at the prompt. You can then press <TT>Enter</TT> to run
<TT>whoami</TT> a second time.

<P>
If you've entered several commands, you can keep pressing the <TT>Up&nbsp;Arrow</TT>
key to go back through them. This feature is handy if you're doing the same
thing several times, or if you type a command incorrectly and want to go back
to fix it. You can press the <TT>Down&nbsp;Arrow</TT> key to move in the other direction,
toward your more recent commands. If there are no more commands to move to,
the computer will beep.

<P>
You can also move around on the command line to make changes. The easiest way
is with the <TT>Left</TT> and <TT>Right&nbsp;Arrow</TT> keys. Try typing <TT>whoasmi</TT>
instead of <TT>whoami</TT>, and then use the <TT>Left&nbsp;Arrow</TT> key to move
back to the <TT>s</TT>. You can erase the <TT>s</TT> with the <TT>Backspace</TT>
or <TT>Delete</TT> keys.

<P>
There are more advanced features as well (no need to memorize them all now,
though). Try pressing <TT>Ctrl-a</TT>. This moves you to the beginning of the
line. <TT>Ctrl-k</TT> (the <TT>k</TT> stands for ``kill'') deletes all characters
until the end of the line; try it from the middle of the command line. Using
<TT>Ctrl-a</TT> followed by <TT>Ctrl-k</TT>, you can delete the entire command
line. <TT>Ctrl-y</TT> pastes the last thing you killed, reinserting it at the
current cursor position (<TT>y</TT> stands for ``yank,'' as in ``yank it
back''). <TT>Ctrl-e</TT> will move the cursor to the end of the command line.

<P>
Go ahead and play around with command-line editing to get a feel for it. Experiment.

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">3</SPAN> Working as Root
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="1392"></A><A NAME="1393"></A><A NAME="1394"></A><A NAME="1395"></A><A NAME="1396"></A>Because Debian is a multiuser system, it's designed to keep any one user or
program from breaking the entire system. The kernel will not allow normal users
to change important system files. This means that things stay the way they're
supposed to, safe from accidents, viruses, and even malicious pranks. Unlike
other operating systems, Debian is safe from these threats. You won't need an
anti-virus program. 

<P>
However, sometimes you need to change important system files; for example, you
might want to install new software or configure your network connection. To
do so, you have to have greater powers than a normal user; you must become the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">root user</SPAN> (also called the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">superuser</SPAN>). 

<P>
To become root, just log on with the username <TT>root</TT> and the root password;
this was set during installation, as described in section <A HREF="node7.html#Set_the_Root_Password">3.15</A>
on page <A HREF="node7.html#Set_the_Root_Password"><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]" SRC="crossref.png"></A>.<A NAME="1402"></A><A NAME="1403"></A><A NAME="1404"></A><A NAME="1405"></A><A NAME="1406"></A><A NAME="1407"></A>

<P>
At many sites, only the system administrator has the root password, and only
the system administrator can do the things that one must be root to do. If you're
using your own personal computer, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">you</SPAN> are the system administrator,
of course. If you don't have root privileges, you will have to rely on your
system administrator to perform any tasks that require root privileges.

<P>
Sometimes you'll have the root password even on a shared corporate or educational
server, because the system administrator trusts you to use it properly. In that
case, you'll be able to help administer the system and customize it for your
needs. But you should be sure to use the password responsibly, respecting other
users at all times. 

<P>
If you have the password, try logging on as root now. <A NAME="1409"></A><A NAME="1410"></A>Enter the <TT>whoami</TT>
command to verify your identity. Then <SPAN  CLASS="textit">log out immediately</SPAN>. When you're
root, the kernel will not protect you from yourself, because root has permission
to do anything at all to the system. Don't experiment while you're root. In
fact, don't do anything as root unless absolutely necessary. This isn't a matter
of security, but rather of stability. Your system will run much better if it
can keep you from making mistakes. 

<P>
You may find the <TT>su</TT> command more convenient than logging in as root.
su allows you to assume the identity of another user, usually root unless you
specify someone else. (You can remember that su stands for Super User, though
some say it stands for Set UserID.) 

<P>
Here's something to try. Log on as yourself - that is, not as root. Then your
session will look something like the one in Figure <A HREF="node8.html#Fig:_Sample_Session_with_su">4.1</A>.<A NAME="1415"></A><A NAME="1416"></A>

<P>
When you're doing system administration tasks, you should do as much as possible
as yourself. Then use <TT>su</TT>, do the part that requires root privileges,
and use the <TT>exit</TT> command to turn off privileges so you can no longer
harm anything. 

<P>
You can use <TT>su</TT> to assume the identity of any user on the system, not
just root. To do this, type <TT>su</TT>&nbsp;<TT><SPAN  CLASS="textit">user</SPAN></TT> where <SPAN  CLASS="textit">user</SPAN>
is the user you want to become. You'll have to know the user's password, of
course, unless you're root at the time or the user has no password.

<BR>
<SPAN CLASS="arabic">4</SPAN> Virtual Consoles
</H1>

<P>
<A NAME="1443"></A><A NAME="1444"></A><A NAME="1445"></A><A NAME="1446"></A><A NAME="1447"></A><A NAME="1448"></A>The Linux kernel supports <SPAN  CLASS="textit">virtual consoles</SPAN>. These provide a way of
making your single screen and keyboard seem like multiple terminals that are
connected to the same system. Thankfully, using virtual consoles is one of the
simplest things about Debian: There are ``hot keys'' for switching among the
consoles quickly. To try it, log in to your system and press <TT>Alt-F2</TT>
(simultaneously press the left <TT>Alt</TT> key, and <TT>F2</TT>, that is, function
key number 2).

<P>
You should find yourself at another login prompt. Don't panic: You are now on
virtual console (VC) number 2! Log in here and do some things - more <TT>whoami</TT>
commands or whatever - to confirm that this is a real login shell. Now you
can return to virtual console number 1 by pressing <TT>Alt-F1</TT>. Or you can
move on to a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">third</SPAN> virtual console, in the obvious way (<TT>Alt-F3</TT>).

<P>
Debian comes with six virtual consoles enabled by default, which you access
with the <TT>Alt</TT> key and function keys <TT>F1</TT> through <TT>F6</TT>.
(Technically, there are more virtual consoles enabled, but only six of them
allow you to log in. The others are used for the X Window System or other special
purposes.)

<P>
If you're using the X Window System, it will generally start up on the first
unused virtual console - probably VC 7. Also, to switch from the X virtual
console to one of the first six, you'll have to add <TT>Ctrl</TT> to the key
sequence. So that's <TT>Ctrl-Alt-F1</TT> to get to VC 1. But you can go from
a text VC to the X virtual console using only <TT>Alt</TT>. If you never leave
X, you won't have to worry about this; X automatically switches you to its virtual
console when it starts up. 

<P>
Once you get used to them, virtual consoles will probably become an indispensable
tool for getting many things done at once. (The X Window System serves much
the same purpose, providing multiple windows rather than multiple consoles.)
You can run a different program on each VC or log on as root on one VC and as
yourself on another. Or everyone in the family can use his or her own VC; this
is especially handy if you use X, in which case you can run several X sessions
at once on different virtual consoles. <A NAME="1463"></A><A NAME="1464"></A><A NAME="1465"></A><A NAME="1466"></A><A NAME="1467"></A><A NAME="1468"></A>

<SPAN CLASS="arabic">5</SPAN> Shutting Down
</H1>

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Do not just turn off the computer! You risk losing valuable data!</SPAN>

<P>
<A NAME="1472"></A><A NAME="1473"></A><A NAME="1474"></A><A NAME="1475"></A><A NAME="1476"></A><A NAME="1477"></A>If you are the only user of your computer, you might want to turn the computer
off when you're done with it. 

<P>
To avoid possibly weakening some hardware components, only turn off the computer
when you're done for the day. Power up and power down are the two greatest contributors
to wear and tear on computer components. Turning the computer on and off once
a day is probably the best compromise between your electric bill and your computer's
lifespan.

<P>
It's a bad thing to just press the power switch when you're done using the computer.
It is also bad to reboot the machine (with the Reset button) without first taking
proper precautions. The Linux kernel, in order to improve performance, has a
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">disk cache</SPAN>. This means it temporarily stores information meant for
permanent storage in RAM. Because memory is thousands of times faster than a
disk, this makes many file operations move more quickly. Periodically, the information
Linux has in memory is actually written to the disk. This is called <SPAN  CLASS="textit">syncing</SPAN>.
In order to turn off or reboot the computer safely, you'll have to tell the
computer to clear everything out of memory and put it in permanent storage.

<P>
To reboot, just type <TT>reboot</TT> or press <TT>Ctrl-Alt-Del</TT> (that's
<TT>Ctrl</TT>, <TT>Alt</TT>, and <TT>Delete</TT>).

<P>
To shut down, you'll have to log in as <TT>root</TT>. As root, just type the
command <TT>shutdown&nbsp;-h&nbsp;now</TT>. The sytem will go through the entire shutdown
procedure, including the <TT>sync</TT> command, which clears the disk cache
as described above. When you see <TT>System&nbsp;halted</TT>, it's safe to turn off
the computer. If you have Advanced Power Management (APM) support in your kernel
and BIOS, the computer might shut itself off and save you the trouble. APM is
common in laptops<A NAME="1489"></A> and is also found in certain desktop mainboards.
