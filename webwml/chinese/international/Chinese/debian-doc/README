This directory contains translated (or translation-in-progress) docs
that fall under the Debian Documentation Project (DDP).
You are welcome to put any related files in this directory, and
announce in debian-chinese to call for help.

Until DDP has better i18n support, we will keep this directory and its
contents for the time being.
