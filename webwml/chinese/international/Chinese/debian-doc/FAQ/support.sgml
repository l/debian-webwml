<sect>Getting support for Debian Linux <label id="Support">
<P>
<sect1>What other documentation exists on and for a Debian system?
<label id="DebianDocs">
<P>
<itemize>
<item>Installation instructions for the current release:  see <url
url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/dists/stable/main/disks-i386/current/install.html"
>.
<P>
<item>dpkg programmer's manual and Debian policy manual
<itemize>
  The <url
  url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/programmer.ps.gz"
  name="dpkg programmer's manual"> is the primary documentation on the
  technical aspects of creating Debian binary and source packages.
  <P>
  This document is also included in the latest <tt>dpkg-dev</tt> package.
  <P>
  The <url
  url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/policy.ps.gz"
  name="Debian policy manual"> documents the policy requirements for a
  package to be included in Debian.
  <P>
  This document is also included in the latest <tt>debian-policy</tt> package.
</itemize>

<P>
<item>Documentation on installed Debian packages:
Most packages have files that are unpacked into
<tt>/usr/doc/PACKAGE</tt>.

<P>
<item>Documentation on the Linux project:
The Debian package <tt>doc-linux</tt> installs all of the most
recent versions of the HOWTOs and mini-HOWTOs from the
<htmlurl url="http://www.linux.locus.halcyon.com/"
name="Linux Documentation Project">.
This package is in the <tt>doc</tt> section in the FTP archives.
<P>
<item>Unix-style 'man' pages:  Most commands have
manual pages written in the style of the original Unix 'man' files.
They are referenced by the section of the 'man' directory where they
reside:  e.g., foo(3) refers to a manual page which resides in /usr/man/man3/,
and it can be called by executing the command:
<tt>man 3 foo</tt>, or just <tt>man foo</tt> if section 3 is the only one
containing a page on <tt>foo</tt>.
One can learn which directory of <tt>/usr/man/</tt> contains a certain
manual page by executing <tt>man -w foo</tt>.
<P>
New Debian users should note that the 'man' pages of many general system
commands are not available until they install these packages:
<!-- This comment is irrelevant, IMHO. SVD.
(both of which are normally stored in the <tt>stable/binary-all/doc/</tt>
directory of the Debian FTP archive:
-->
<itemize>
<item><tt>manpages</tt>
(see <ref id="nonEngl" name="support for non-English languages">).
<item><tt>man-db</tt>, which contains the <tt>man</tt> program
itself, and other programs for manipulating the manual pages.
<P>
</itemize>

<item>GNU-style 'info' pages:  User documentation for many commands,
particularly GNU tools, is available not in 'man' pages, but in 'info'
files which can be read by the GNU tool <tt>info</tt> or by running
<tt>M-x info</tt> within GNU Emacs.
Its main advantage over the original
'man' pages are that it is a hypertext system.  It does <em>not</em>
require the WWW, however; <tt>info</tt> can be run from a plain text
console.  It was designed by Richard Stallman and preceded the WWW.
The program that manipulates `info' files is installed
as a separate package <tt>info</tt>, usually stored in
the <tt>doc</tt> section on the FTP archive.
</itemize>

<!-- XXX dwww - not yet ready
Lars Wirzenius (liw@iki.fi) says this isn't ready to mention yet.
     Keep it here as a placeholder.
The on-line documents can be accessed in a uniform way by a WWW browser
by installing the new package <tt>dwww</tt>.

<sect1>Are there any on-line resources for discussing Debian?
<label id="resources">
<P>

There are several Debian-related mailing lists:
<itemize>
<item><bf>debian-announce@lists.debian.org (moderated)</bf>.
(Usually) major system announcements.  On average,
fewer than one message per week are posted here.

<item><bf>debian-changes@lists.debian.org</bf>.
Announcements of new package uploads for the Debian system.
This list may carry several announcements in a day.

<item><bf>debian-user@lists.debian.org <label id="debian-user"></bf>.
A mailing list where users can ask for and receive advice on the
use or configuration of Debian packages or other aspects of Debian Linux.
This list is an invaluable learning resource;
there can be 50 messages a day or more on this list.

<item><bf>debian-sparc@lists.debian.org <label id="debian-sparc"></bf>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to the SPARC
platform.

<item><bf>debian-alpha@lists.debian.org <label id="debian-alpha"></bf>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to DEC alpha
platforms.

<item><bf>debian-68k@lists.debian.org <label id="debian-68k"></bf>.
This list is for those involved in porting Debian software to Motorola 680x0
platforms; currently this means the Atari and Amiga only.

<item><bf>debian-talk@lists.debian.org <label id="debian-talk"></bf>.

</itemize>

To subscribe to debian-X (for X in announce, changes, user, talk),
send mail to
debian-X-request@lists.debian.org with the word &dquot;subscribe&dquot; in
the Subject: header.
If you have a forms-capable World Wide Web browser, you can
subscribe to debian-announce and debian-user by using the
<url url="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/subscribe.html"
 name="WWW form">.
You can also un-subscribe using that form.

The list manager's e-mail address is
    <htmlurl
     url="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org"
     name="listmaster@lists.debian.org"
    >

Archives of the Debian mailing lists are available via WWW at <url
url="https://lists.debian.org/"> and via FTP from <url
url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/debian-lists/">.

Users can address questions to individual package maintainers, since their
e-mail addresses are provided in the Debian control file (see section
<ref id="CtlFile" name="Debian control file">)
that is included within each package.  One can also learn the maintainers'
names and e-mail addresses by searching the &dquot;Packages&dquot; file, since
this file is just a concatenation of all the available package control files
in a particular directory tree. To extract a control file from a
particular Debian package, use the command,
<tscreen><verb>
dpkg --info packageName_VVV-RRR.deb
</verb></tscreen>

Another related mailing list, <bf>debiangame</bf>, is being run by Gary Moore
(<url url="mailto:gary@ssc.com">)
at the University of Washington.  As the name suggests, it is devoted
to the discussion of games that have been (or might be) packaged for Debian.
To subscribe, send mail to <tt>listproc@u.washington.edu</tt>, putting in
the message body:
<tscreen><verb>
  subscribe debiangame FirstName LastName
</verb></tscreen>
Both FirstName and LastName are required for ListProc.

<P>
Users should post non-Debian-specific questions to one of
the Linux Usenet groups, which are named comp.os.linux.* or
linux.*.  Specialized Systems Consultants (a.k.a. SSC) maintains a
<url url="http://www.ssc.com/linux/news.html"
name="list of Linux, Unix, X, and networking newsgroups">
on their WWW site.


<sect1>What is the code of conduct for the mailing lists?
<label id="MailingListConduct">
<P>

 When using the Debian mailing lists, please follow these rules:
<itemize>
<item>Do not flame; it is not polite.  Besides the people developing Debian
         are all volunteers, donating their time, energy and money in an
         attempt to bring the Debian project together.
<item>Do not use foul language; some people receive the lists via packet
         radio, where swear words are illegal.
<item>Make sure that you are using the proper list.
<item>Do not try posting unless you are subscribed.  Posting by
non-subscribers was turned off to make the mailing lists usable.
Thus, only postings from e-mail addresses matching those of a subscriber
are accepted. If you often post from other addresses than the one
you subscribe with, mail the list manager
    <htmlurl
     url="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org"
     name="listmaster@lists.debian.org"
    >
with the subject &dquot;please add subscriber alias&dquot;.
<item>See section <ref id="bugrpt" name="reporting bugs">
for notes on reporting bugs.
</itemize>

<!-- is this still valid, esp. the FSF reference
 [Ray] I don't think so; Bruce said somewhere that it wouldn't be
 enforceable since the listserver is now in Sweden -->
<!--
<sect2>Mailing list advertising policy<label id="advertising">
<P>
The Debian Linux mailing lists accept commercial advertising for
payment. We offer a fee waiver if you can show us the cancelled check
for a &dollar;1000 (U.S.) or more donation to the Free Software Foundation
earmarked for &dquot;Debian&dquot;. One donation per advertisement,
please. If you
do not wish to donate, simply post your advertisement to the list, and
the operator of the mailing lists will bill &dollar;1999 (U.S). The list
operator will donate this amount, minus the expense of collecting it,
to FSF.

By the act of posting your advertisement you agree to accept
responsibility for the fee, you agree to indemnify the mailing-list
operator against any legal claims from you or others in connection with
your advertisement, and you agree to pay any legal and business
expenses incurred in collecting late payment. Our liability to you is
limited to a good-faith effort to deliver your message.

Reduced rates and/or waiver of fee are available for Debian-related
advertisements. You must consult the mailing-list operator in advance
of posting for any reduction or fee waiver.

<sect1>Is there a quick way to search for information on Debian GNU/Linux?
<label id="Searchtools">
<P>
There are a variety of search engines that serve documentation related
to Debian.

<itemize>

<item> <htmlurl url="http://insite.verisim.com/search/debian/simple"
name="Verisim's search site">.  To obtain information on how to submit
a debian bug report, enter the words <tt>debian bug submit</TT>
and search for &dquot;all of these words&dquot;.

<!-- It appears the glimpse engine isn't working right now, October 23, 1996
<item> <htmlurl url="https://www.debian.org/ghindex.html"
name="Glimpse-based search engine on the Debian WWW site">
This search engine is based on
<tt>>agrep</tt>, and is often used similarly, i.e., to search for words
which occur together on a single line of text (although it can be configured
for more sophisticated searching).
-->
<!-- Whenever the glimpse-based engine comes on line, the above paragraph
should give a specific example. -->

<item> <htmlurl url="http://www.dejanews.com/"
name="DejaNews news search service">.  To find out what experiences people
have had with finding drivers for Western Digital controllers, try searching
on this phrase:
<tscreen><verb>
linux & WD
</verb></tscreen>
This tells DejaNews to report any postings containing both the
string &dquot;linux&dquot; AND the string &dquot;WD&dquot;
When I used it, I discovered that my WD card (which I have only had for
6 months) has been declared outmoded by Adaptec, now that they have bought
WD. So there are no drivers available.  (Bless Adaptec's hearts.)

<item> The <htmlurl url="http://altavista.digital.com/"
name="AltaVista Search Engine"> can also be used to search Usenet
(although it appears to be not quite as up to date as DejaNews).
For example, searching on the string "cgi-perl" gives a more detailed
explanation of this package than the brief description field in its
control file.

</itemize>
