<sect>Debian and the kernel <label id="Kernel">
<P>
<sect1>What tools does Debian provide to build custom kernels? <label id="custker">
<P>
Users who wish to (or must) build a custom kernel are encouraged to download
the package <tt>kernel-package_VVV_all.deb</tt> (it is stored in section
<tt>misc</tt> at the Debian FTP archives).  This package contains
the script to build the kernel package, and provides the capability to
create a Debian kernel-image package just by running the command
<tt>make-kpkg kernel_image</tt> in the top-level kernel source directory.
Help is available by executing the command <tt>make-kpkg --help</tt>,
and through the manual page for make-kpkg(8).
<P>
Users must separately download the source code for the most recent
kernel (or the kernel of their choice) from their favorite Linux archive
site.
<P>
To build a custom kernel, users must have these packages installed:
<tt>gcc</tt>,
<tt>libc6-dev</tt>,
<tt>bin86</tt>,
<tt>binutils</tt>,
and <tt>make</tt>.
<P>
Executing the command <tt>dpkg --install kernel-package_VVV_all.deb</tt>
sets up the directory <tt>/usr/src/linux-VVV/</tt>, and
sets up the link <tt>/usr/src/linux</tt> to point to the
directory <tt>/usr/src/linux-VVV/</tt> containing the kernel sources.
<P>
Detailed instructions for using the package are given in the file
<tt>/usr/doc/kernel-package/README</tt>.  Briefly, one should:
<itemize>
<item>Unpack the kernel sources, and <tt>cd</tt> to the newly created
directory.
<item>Modify the kernel configuration using one of these commands:
  <itemize>
  <item><tt>make config</tt>  (for a tty one-line-at-a-time-interface).
  <item><tt>make menuconfig</tt>  (for an ncurses-based menu driven interface).
Note that to use this option, the <tt>ncurses3.0-dev</tt> package
must be installed.
  <item><tt>make xconfig</tt>  (for an X11 interface).
Using this option requires that relevant X packages be installed.
  </itemize>
  Any of the above steps generates a new <tt>.config</tt> in the top-level
kernel source directory.
<item>Execute the command: <tt>make-kpkg -r Custom.N kernel_image</tt>, where
N is a revision number assigned by the user.
The new Debian archive thus formed would have revision Custom.1, e.g.,
<tt>kernel-image-2.0.36-Custom.1.deb</tt>
for the Linux kernel 2.0.36.
<P>
<!-- XXX nested itemize (sgml2txt problem)-->
<item>Install the package created.
  <itemize>
  <item><tt>Run dpkg --install /usr/src/kernel-image_VVV-Custom.N.deb</tt>
to install the kernel itself.  The installation script will:
  <itemize>
     <item>run the boot loader, LILO (if it is installed),
     <item>install the custom kernel in /boot/vmlinuz_VVV-Custom.N, and
set up appropriate symbolic links to the most recent kernel version.
     <item>prompt the user to make a boot floppy.  This boot floppy will
contain the raw kernel only.  See additional notes for making a
<ref id="cusboot" name="custom boot floppy">.
     </itemize>
  <item>To employ a secondary boot loaders (e.g., <tt>loadlin</tt>), copy
  this image to other locations (e.g., an <tt>MS-DOS</tt> partition).
  </itemize>
</itemize>

<sect1>How can I make a custom boot floppy?<label id="cusboot"></>
<P>
This task is greatly aided by the Debian package
<tt>boot-floppies</tt>, normally found in the <tt>devel</tt>
section of the Debian FTP archive.  Shell scripts in this package
produce boot floppies in the <tt>SYSLINUX</tt> format.  These are
<tt>MS-DOS</tt> formatted floppies whose master boot records have been
altered so that they boot Linux directly (or whatever other operating system
has been defined in the syslinux.cfg file on the floppy).
Other shell scripts in this package produce emergency root disks and
can even reproduce the base disks.

When the boot-floppies package is installed, it produces files which reside
in <tt>/usr/src/boot-floppies/</tt>, including the three
scripts, called <tt>bootdisk.sh</tt>, <tt>rootdisk.sh</tt>, and
<tt>basedisk.sh</tt>.  Users of these scripts are encouraged to read
them and customize as appropriate.  In particular, one should
include the kernel of your choice when invoking the <tt>bootdisk.sh</tt>
script.  <em>Be aware that this kernel cannot be used to load the root disk
into a RAMDISK unless it was compiled with <tt>CONFIG_RAMDISK=y</tt>, and
<tt>CONFIG_INITRD=y</tt></em>.

To write the kernel-image-2.0.36 package to the 1.44 MByte disk in drive
A: run this command:
<tscreen><verb>
./bootdisk.sh /usr/src/kernel-image-2.0.36_1.00.deb /dev/fd0 1440
</verb></tscreen>

Be sure to include the editor and whatever other tools you prefer
when building your custom root disk with <tt>./rootdisk.sh</tt>.
<P>
Some people found that the boot and root disks make good emergency floppies.

<sect1>What special provisions does Debian provide to deal with modules?
<P>
Debian's <tt>modconf</tt> package provides a shell script
(<tt>/usr/sbin/modconf</tt>) which can be used to customize the
configuration of modules.  This script presents a menu-based interface,
prompting the user for particulars on the loadable device drivers
in his system.  The responses are used to customize the file
<tt>/etc/conf.modules</tt> (which lists aliases, and other arguments that
must be used in conjunction with various modules),
and <tt>/etc/modules</tt> (which lists the modules that must be loaded
at boot time).

Like the (new) Configure.help files that are now available to support
the construction of custom kernels, the modconf package comes with a
series of help files (in <tt>/usr/lib/modules_help/</tt>)
which provide detailed information on appropriate arguments for each of
the modules.

<sect1>Can I safely de-install an old kernel, and if so how?
<P>
Yes.  The <tt>kernel-image-NNN.prerm</tt> script checks to see whether the
kernel you are currently running is the same as the kernel you are trying
to de-install.  Therefore you can remove unwanted kernel image packages using
this command:

<tt>dpkg --purge --force-remove-essential kernel-image-NNN</tt>
