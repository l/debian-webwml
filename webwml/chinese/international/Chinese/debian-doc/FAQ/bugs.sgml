<sect>The Debian Bug Report System<label id="Bugs">
<sect1>Are there logs of known bugs?<label id="Buglogs">
<P>
The Debian Linux distribution has a bug tracking system which files
details of bugs reported by users and developers. Each bug is given a
number, and is kept on file until it is marked as having been dealt with.

Copies of this information are available at <url
url="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/">.

A mail server provides access to the bug tracking system database via
e-mail.  In order to get the instructions send an e-mail to
request@bugs.debian.org with "help" in the body.

<sect1>How do I report a bug in Debian?<label id="bugrpt">
<P>
If you have found a bug in Debian, please read the instructions for reporting
a bug in Debian.  These instructions can be obtained in one of several ways:
<itemize>
<item>By anonymous ftp.  Debian mirror sites contain the instructions in the
file <tt>doc/bug-reporting.txt</tt>.
<item>From the WWW.  A copy of the instructions is shown at
<url url="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/Reporting.html">
<item>On any Debian system with the <tt>doc-debian</tt> package installed.
The instructions are in the file
<tt><htmlurl url="file:/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt"
name="/usr/doc/debian/bug-reporting.txt">
</tt>.
</itemize>

Use these mail addresses for bugs:
<itemize>
<item>submit@bugs.debian.org:  for general bug reports.  Expect to
get an automatic acknowledgement of your bug report.  It will also be
automatically given a bug tracking number, entered into the bug log
and forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.
<item>maintonly@bugs.debian.org:  to send bug reports to the maintainer
only. It will not be forwarded to the debian-bugs-dist mailing list.

<!-- Now that Lintian exists and reporting several bugs is discouraged,
it is better to comment this out. SVD

For example, if one were to identify a bug that was common to many programs,
then rather than entering dozens of bug reports, one might prefer to
send individual bugs to maintonly, then send a summary report to
debian-bugs-dist.

-->

<item>quiet@bugs.debian.org:  to submit bug reports to the bug log only,
without having them sent either to debian-bugs-dist or to the maintainer.
</itemize>

Please, note that there is a Debian package checker called <url
url="http://lintian.debian.org/" name="Lintian">, which is
designed to mechanically check Debian packages for policy violations and
common packaging errors. Thus, if you detect a bug in a package which is
likely to appear in other packages too, it might be better to get in
contact with the <url url="mailto:lintian-maint@debian.org"
name="Lintian maintainers"> so that
a new check is written for Lintian instead of reporting the bug directly.
This will prevent the bug to appear in future versions of the package
again, or in any other package of the distribution.
