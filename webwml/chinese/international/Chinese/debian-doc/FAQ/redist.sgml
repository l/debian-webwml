<sect>Redistributing Debian GNU/Linux in a commercial product<label id="Redistributing">
<P>

<sect1>Can I make and sell Debian CDs?
<P>
Go ahead. You do not need permission to distribute anything we have
<em>released</em>, so that you can master your CD as soon as the beta-test
ends. You do not have to pay us anything. We will, however, publish a
list of CD manufacturers who donate money, software, and time to the
Debian project, and we will encourage users to buy from manufacturers who
donate, so it is good advertising to make donations. Of course all CD
manufacturers must honor the licenses of the programs in Debian. For
example, many of the programs are licensed under the GPL, which
requires you to distribute their source code.

<sect1>Can Debian be packaged with non-free software?
<P>
Yes. While all the main components of Debian are free software, we
provide a non-free directory for programs that are not freely
redistributable.
<!-- redistributable
Yes. While all the main components of Debian are free software, we
!   provide a non-free directory for programs that can not be freely
!   redistributed.

CD manufacturers <em>may</em> be able to distribute the
programs we have placed in that directory, depending on the license terms
or their private arrangements with the authors of those software
packages. CD manufacturers can also distribute the non-free software
they get from other sources on the same CD. This is nothing new: free
and commercial software are distributed on the same CD by many
manufacturers now. Of course we still encourage software authors to
release the programs they write as free software.

<sect1>I am making a special Linux distribution for a &dquot;vertical market&dquot;. Can I use Debian GNU/Linux for the guts of a Linux system and add my own applications on top of it?
<P>
Yes. For example, one person is building a &dquot;Linux for Hams&dquot;
distribution, with specialized programs for Radio Amateurs. He is
starting with Debian as the &dquot;base system&dquot;, and adding
programs to
control the transmitter, track satellites, etc. All of the programs he
adds are packaged with the Debian package system so that his users will
be able to upgrade easily when he releases subsequent CDs.
<P>
Debian also provides a mechanism to allow developers and system administrators
to install local versions of selected files in such a way that they will
not be overwritten when other packages are upgraded.  This is discussed
further in the question on <ref id="divert" name="diversions">.

<sect1> Can I put my commercial program in a Debian &dquot;package&dquot;
so that it installs effortlessly on any Debian system?
<P>
Go right ahead. The package tool is free software.

<!--
We should probably recommend here to follow debian-policy,
so that the commercial package fits with the rest of the system.
