<sect>What kind of changes should I expect to see in the next major release of Debian Linux? <label id="Future">
<P>

<sect1>Increased security
<P>
Debian now has Shadow password.
<P>
In addition, the Linux library of Pluggable Authentication Modules
(<url url="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/libs/pam/">;
a.k.a. <tt>libpam</tt>) that allow sysadmins to choose authorization modes
on an application-specific basis will be available, and initially set to
authenticate via shadow password.

<sect1>More Support for non-English users
<p>
Debian already has some
<ref id="nonEngl" name="support for non-English users">.
We hope to find people who provide support for even more languages.
<p>
Some programs already support internationalization, so we need message
catalogs. Many programs still must be internationalized.
<p>
The GNU Translation Project <url
url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ABOUT-NLS"> works on
internationalizing the GNU programs.

<sect1>More architectures
<p>
Currently a complete Debian release is available for the i386 and
m68k architectures. Complete Debian system on other architectures are
expected soon.

<sect1>Linux 2.2
<p>
Debian 2.1 will be the last release based on Linux 2.0.x.
The Debian release after it, codenamed <tt>potato</tt> will
probably include the latest stable Linux kernel, version 2.2.x.

<sect1>glibc 2.1
<p>
Debian 2.1 will be the last Debian release based on GNU libc version 2.0.x.
<tt>potato</tt> will probably include the latest stable GNU libc library,
versión 2.1.x (which is already being used in <tt>slink</tt> by some of
the non-Intel architectures).
