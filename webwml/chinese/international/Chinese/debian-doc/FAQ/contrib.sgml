<sect>Contributing to the Debian project <label id="Contributing">
<P>
Donations of time (to develop new packages, maintain existing
packages, or provide user support), resources (to mirror the FTP and WWW
archives), and money (to pay for new testbeds as well as hardware for
the archives) can help the project.

<sect1>How can I become a Debian software developer?<label id="contrib">
<P>
The development of Debian is open to all, and new users
with the right skills and/or the willingness to learn are needed to
maintain existing packages which have been &dquot;orphaned&dquot; by
their previous maintainers, to develop new packages, and to provide user
support.
<P>
All the details about becoming a Debian developer may now be found in the
<tt>developers-reference</tt> package. You should therefore install this
package and read it carefully.
<P>
An on-line version of developers-reference is available
<url
url="http://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/developers-reference/"
name="here">.

<!-- Most of what follows is now removed to avoid duplication.

To develop a Debian package, you should:
<itemize>
<item>(of course) download Debian and install it on your
system.
<item>find a program you would like to package that is not presently part
of Debian.  In this regard, the  Work Needing and Prospective Packages document
(available as
<htmlurl url="ftp://ftp.debian.org/debian/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.txt" name="/debian/doc/package-developer/prospective-packages.txt"> at the Debian FTP server) should serve as a useful guide.

<item>Subscribe to debian-devel.
<P>
To do this execute
<tscreen><verb>
        mail debian-devel-REQUEST@lists.debian.org -s Subscribe
</verb></tscreen>

That is, send mail to the above address with the subject set to 'Subscribe'.

<item>Publish your plan in debian-devel.
<P>
Send a mail to debian-devel that explains what you plan to do. So other
developers can give some hints.

<item>Set up your PGP key.
<P>Install the PGP package; read /usr/doc/pgp/; generate a
public-secret key pair by typing <tt>pgp -kg</tt>
    and answering the questions.  (Be prepared to write some arbitrary text
    when asked.  PGP generates its true random numbers by measuring the
    intervals between your keystrokes.)

<item>Shake hands with the project administration:
<P>
    Send an e-mail to
	<htmlurl url="mailto:new-maintainer@debian.org"
		name="new-maintainer@debian.org">

    with this content:
    <itemize>
    <item> what you have done,
    <item> who you are,
    <item> request for an account on master,
    <item> request to be subscribed to debian-private (the developers-only
       mailing list).
    <item> your PGP key, obtained by executing 'pgp -kxa'.
    </itemize>

<item>Make the programs:  .deb, .diff, .tar.gz, .changes.
    <P>
    Use the <tt>hello*deb</tt> and <tt>dpkg*deb</tt> packages as guides,
    and read the <it>policy manual</it> and <it>dpkg programmers manual</it>.

<item>Upload the files to
    <P>
    <itemize>
    <item><tt>ftp://master.debian.org/home/Debian/ftp/private/project/Incoming/</tt>
    using your user-name and password, or
    <item><tt>ftp://ftp.chiark.greenend.org.uk/</tt> using anonymous ftp.
    <P>
        For instructions to upload to chiark, read this file at chiark:
        <tt>/pub/debian/private/project/README.how-to-upload</tt>.
    <it>chiark</it> then sends the files it gets to master.
    </itemize>

<sect2>Are there additional information resources for developers?
<P>
Besides <tt>debian-devel</tt>, there are these mailing lists:
<itemize>
<item>The Debian Policy list: debian-policy@lists.debian.org.
<item>The SPARC port developers list:  debian-sparc@lists.debian.org.
<item>The Alpha port developers list: debian-alpha@lists.debian.org.
<item>The Motorola 680x0 port developers list: debian-68k@lists.debian.org.
<item>The dpkg development list: debian-dpkg@lists.debian.org.
<item>Debian for Hams: debian-hams@lists.debian.org.
<item>Debian package maintainers only: debian-private@lists.debian.org.
</itemize>

To subscribe to debian-devel, or other developers' lists, send a
message to the <tt>-request</tt> address of the list containing just the
word <tt>subscribe</tt> in the body of the message.

If you have a problem when suscribing to any of these lists, please
contact <htmlurl url="mailto:listmaster@lists.debian.org"

<sect1>How can I contribute resources to the Debian project?
<P>
Since the project aims to make a substantial body of software rapidly
and easily accessible throughout the globe, mirrors are urgently needed.
It is desirable but not absolutely necessary to mirror all of the archive.
The current components amount to just over 6 GBytes, broken down roughly
as follows:

<itemize>
<!-- XXX keep numbers up-to-date -->
<!-- Note: These are figures for *all* the archs. -->
<!-- Note: slink has four archs: i386, m68k, alpha and sparc -->

<item>slink/main: 3100 MBytes.
<item>slink/contrib: 210 MBytes.
<item>slink/non-free: 570 MBytes.
<item>potato: 2100 MBytes (it will surely grow at release time).
<item>sid: 1120 MBytes.
</itemize>

Most of the mirroring is accomplished entirely automatically by scripts,
without any human intervention.  However, the occasional glitch or system
change occurs which requires human intervention.
<P>
If you have a high-speed connection to the Internet, the resources to
mirror all or part of the distribution, and are willing to
take the time (or find someone) who can provide regular maintenance of
the system, then please contact <tt>debian-admin@debian.org</tt>.


<sect1>How can I contribute financially to the Debian project?
<label id="SupportingOrganizations">
<P>
One can make individual donations to one of two organizations that
are critical to the development of the Debian project.

<sect2>Software in the Public Interest<label id="SPI">
<P>

Software in the Public Interest (SPI) is a non-profit organization
formed when FSF withdrew their sponsorship of Debian.  We are currently
incorporating as an IRS 501(c)(3) non-profit organization. The purpose
of the organization is
to develop and distribute free software. Our goals are very much like
those of FSF, and we encourage programmers to use the GNU General
Public License on their programs. However, we have a slightly different
focus in that we are building and distributing a Linux system that
diverges in many technical details from the GNU system planned by FSF.
We still communicate with FSF, and we cooperate in sending them changes
to GNU software and in asking our users to donate to FSF and the GNU
project.

SPI can be reached at:

<url url="http://www.spi-inc.org/">

<sect2>Free Software Foundation<label id="FSF">
<P>
At this time there is no formal connection between Debian and the Free
Software Foundation. However, the Free Software Foundation is
responsible for some of the most important software components in
Debian, including the GNU C compiler, GNU Emacs, and much of the C
run-time library that is used by all programs on the system. FSF pioneered
much of what free software is today: they wrote the General Public
License that is used on much of the Debian software, and they invented
the "GNU" project to create an entirely free Unix system. Debian should
be considered a descendent of the GNU system.

When you make a donation to FSF, please be sure to tell them that you
are a Debian user. Please contact them at:
