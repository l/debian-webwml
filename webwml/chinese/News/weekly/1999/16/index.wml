<b>Voting on the license for the Debian logo has begun.</b> The vote also 
encompasses the number of logos that will be used, either one or two.
For details on the options, see the 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00021.html">
call for votes</a> and then
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-9904/msg00023.html">
cast your ballot</a>. Of course, only developers can vote.

據 <a href="http://www.news.com/News/Item/0,4,35166,00.html">news.com
報導</a>，<b>加拿大 Corel 公司將發行 a Debian variant</b>。
"<i>Corel will base a Linux product [..] on the version of 
Linux from Debian.</i>" Corel appears to be interested in improving 
Debian's ease of installation and use and bundling it with WordPerfect
及其他 Corel 軟件，beta 測試版預期本年八月推出。
Debian 目前尚未作正式通告。

An interesting development in the past couple of weeks has been more
<b>mainstream online press stories referencing and linking to items that
originate on the Debian mailing lists</b>. For example, 
<a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com/tech/feature/1999/04/15/linux_help/index.html">
here's</a> a Salon Magazine story with a link buried in the middle to the
"clueless users" post from 3 weeks ago. And 
<a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now0409.txt">here's</a>
an article on the Perens/Raymond mess with links to postings on our mailing
lists. Unfortunately, none of these links cast Debian in a very positive
light. Other more positive references to Debian in the press this week
include <b>a few mentions in Linux Journal issue #61</b>, where Debian is
revealed as the distribution of choice for one author's PPP servers, and for
another's remotely upgradable secure Internet gateways.

<b>Work is beginning on a Chinese translation project.</b>
Some of Debian's web pages have been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-www-9904/msg00036.html">
translated to Chinese</a>。The debian-chinese mailing list has been created.
The Chinese translation effort is being coordinated by Anthony Wong
黃彥邦。 If you 
would like to help out with the project, 請訂閱 debian-chinese 郵遞表。
