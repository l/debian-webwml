# This script originates from https://www.debian.org/mirror/anonftpsync

# CVS: cvs.debian.org:/cvs/webwml - webwml/english/mirror/anonftpsync
# Version: $Id$ 

# Note: You MUST have rsync 2.6.4 or newer, which is available in sarge
# and all newer Debian releases, or at http://rsync.samba.org/

# Don't forget:
# chmod u+x anonftpsync

# Set the variables below to fit your site. You can then use cron to have
# this script run daily to automatically update your copy of the archive.

# TO is the destination for the base of the Debian mirror directory
# (the dir that holds dists/ and ls-lR).
# (mandatory)

TO=

# RSYNC_HOST is the site you have chosen from the mirrors file.
# (https://www.debian.org/mirror/list-full)
# (mandatory)

RSYNC_HOST=

# RSYNC_DIR is the directory given in the "Packages over rsync:" line of
# the mirrors file for the site you have chosen to mirror.
# (mandatory)

RSYNC_DIR=debian

# LOGDIR is the directory where the logs will be written to
# (mandatory)

LOGDIR=

# ARCH_EXCLUDE can be used to exclude a complete architecture from
# mirrorring. Please use as space seperated list.
# Possible values are:
# alpha, amd64, arm, armel, hppa, hurd-i386, i386, ia64, m68k, mipsel, mips, powerpc, s390, sh and sparc
#
# There is one special value: source
# This is not an architecture but will exclude all source code in /pool
#
# eg.
# ARCH_EXCLUDE="alpha arm armel hppa hurd-i386 ia64 m68k mipsel mips s390 sparc"
# 
# With a blank ARCH_EXCLUDE you will mirror all available architectures
# (optional)

ARCH_EXCLUDE=

# EXCLUDE is a list of parameters listing patterns that rsync will exclude, in
# addition to the architectures excluded by ARCH_EXCLUDE.
#
# Use ARCH_EXCLUDE to exclude specific architectures or all sources
#
# --exclude stable, testing, unstable options DON'T remove the packages of
# the given distribution. If you want do so, use debmirror instead.
#
# The following example would exclude mostly everything:
#EXCLUDE="\
#  --exclude stable/ --exclude testing/ --exclude unstable/ \
#  --exclude source/ \
#  --exclude *.orig.tar.gz --exclude *.diff.gz --exclude *.dsc \
#  --exclude /contrib/ --exclude /non-free/ \
# "

# With a blank EXCLUDE you will mirror the entire archive, except the
# architectures excluded by ARCH_EXCLUDE.
# (optional)

EXCLUDE=

# MAILTO is the address to send logfiles to;
# if it is not defined, no mail will be sent
# (optional)

MAILTO=

# LOCK_TIMEOUT is a timeout in minutes.  Defaults to 360 (6 hours).
# This program creates a lock to ensure that only one copy
# of it is mirroring any one archive at any one time.
# Locks held for longer than the timeout are broken, unless
# a running rsync process appears to be connected to $RSYNC_HOST.

LOCK_TIMEOUT=360

# You may establish the connection via a web proxy by setting the environment
# variable RSYNC_PROXY to a hostname:port pair pointing to your web proxy.  Note
# that your web proxyâ€™s configuration must support proxy connections to port 873.

# are problems.
