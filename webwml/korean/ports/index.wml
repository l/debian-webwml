<toc-add-entry name="intro">소개</toc-add-entry>
<p>여러분 대부분이 아는 바와 같이, <a href="https://www.kernel.org/">리눅스</a>는 그냥 커널입니다.
오래도록, 리눅스 커널은 386에서부터 오직 인텔 x86계열 기계에서만 돌아갔습니다.
</p>
<p>그러나, 어떤 의미로든 이제 더 이상은 아닙니다.
리눅스 커널은 이제는 커다란, 그리고 자라나는, 아키텍처의 목록에 심어졌습니다.
끝으로, 우리는 데비안 배포본을 이들 아키텍처에 심었습니다.
일반적으로, 이것은 끈끈한 시작(libc와 동적 링커가 부드럽게 진행)을 가진 절차이며,
그 다음에는 새 아키텍처 아래에서 모든 패키지를 재컴파일 하려는
비교적 긴 루틴입니다.
</p>
<p>데비안은 운영 체제(OS)이며, 커널이 아닙니다
(그것은 OS 이상인데 왜냐면 그것이 수천 응용프로그램을 포함하고 있기 때문). 즉,
데부분의 데비안 포트가 리눅스 기반이지만, 
FreeBSD, NetBSD 그리고 Hurd kernel에 기반한 포트도 있습니다.
</p>

<div class="important">
<p>이 페이지는 진행중입니다.
모든 포트가 페이지를 가진 건 아니며, 대부분은 외부 사이트에 있습니다.
우리는 모든 포트의 정보를 모으고, 데비안 웹 사이트를 통해 미러 하려고 하고 있습니다.
더 많은 포트가 위키에 <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/CategoryPorts">나열</a>될 수 있습니다.

<td><a href="amd64/">amd64</a></td>
<td>64-bit PC (amd64)</td>
<td>First officially released with Debian 4.0. Port to 64-bit x86
processors. The goal is to support both 32-bit and 64-bit userland on this
architecture. This port supports AMD's 64-bit Opteron, Athlon and Sempron
processors, and Intel's processors with Intel 64 support, including the
Pentium D and various Xeon and Core series.</td>

<td>64-bit ARM (AArch64)</td>
<td>Version 8 of the ARM architecture included AArch64, a new 64-bit
instruction set. Since Debian 8.0, the arm64 port has been included in
Debian to support this new instruction set on processors such as the
Applied Micro X-Gene, AMD Seattle and Cavium ThunderX.</td>

<td><a href="arm/">armhf</a></td>
<td>Hard Float ABI ARM</td>
<td>A lot of modern 32-bit ARM boards and devices ship with a floating-point
unit (FPU), but the Debian armel port doesn't take much advantage
of it. The armhf port was started to improve this situation and also take
advantage of other features of newer ARM CPUs. The Debian armhf port
requires at least an ARMv7 CPU with Thumb-2 and VFP3-D16 floating point
support.</td>

developed for the Intel 386 processors, hence the short name. Debian
supports all IA-32 processors, made by Intel (including all Pentium
series and recent Core Duo machines in 32-bit mode), AMD (K6, all Athlon
series, Athlon64 series in 32-bit mode), Cyrix and other
