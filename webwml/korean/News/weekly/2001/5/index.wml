<p>
<b>데비안 지도자 선거의 열기가 오르고 있다.</b>
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00000.html">Anand
Kumria</a>, <a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00001.html">
Bdale Garbee</a>, 그리고 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00002.html">Branden
Robinson</a>는 모두 데비안 지도자 출마를 선언하여 Ben Collins에 동참하였다.
일이 늦게 시작하였기 때문에 선거 시간표는
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-vote-0102/msg00004.html">
연장되었다</a>. 후보 지명 기간이 오늘 끝나면 선거 운동이 본격적으로 시작할
것이다.
</p>

<p>
<b>새 관리자 과정에 큰 변화가 생겼다.</b> 개발자가 될 사람들은 이제부터 
새 관리자 과정을 거치기 전에 현임 데비안 개발자의 추천을 받아야 한다.
이로써 개발자가 되기에 진지하지 않은 지원자들의 수를 줄이고 그 밖의 모든이들의
과정을 빠르게 하도록 희망하는 바이다. 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00004.html">
새 요구 사항을 설명하는 메일</a>에서, Martin Michlmayr는
"<i>데비안에 진지한 관심을 갖는 모든 사람에게, 추천을 얻는 일은 전혀 문제가
되지 않을 것이다 -- 데비안에 패키지가 이미 있는 사람은 후원자의 추천을 
받을 수 있다; 데비안 포팅이나 웹페이지, 혹은 부트 플로피 작업을 해 온 사람은
자신을 추천할 데비안 개발자를 알 것</i>"이라고 예견하였다.

<p>
<b>Some problems with testing have come to light</b> over the past couple of
weeks. A broken version of lilo slipped into testing by accident, and we had
another round of the same lilo problems unstable users have endured. Then a
new version of console-tools entered testing, but it turned out it had an
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/84741">undeclared dependency</a> on 
unstable's version of debconf. Many other packages that are broken for one
reason or another have been 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0102/msg00530.html">removed
from testing</a> until they are fixed. These problems just show that
maintenance of testing cannot be entirely automated; it needs some manual
attention just like other branches of Debian. Testing is meant to be somewhere
in between stable and unstable in up-to-dateness and usability, and it is
meeting that goal, though it has required a bit more maintenance effort than
we might have expected. But a more worrying problem with testing has also
emerged.
</p>

<p>
<b>Security fixes
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-0102/msg00629.html">trickle
into testing</a> just as slowly as do any other updated packages
from unstable.</b> While stable has <tt>security.debian.org</tt> to provide 
timely security fixes, and unstable gets most fixes immediately, security 
fixes will not enter testing until they have been built on all architectures,
and until all their dependencies have also entered testing. Unrelated release
critical bugs can keep security fixes out of testing too. So while testing is
reasonably current, and not too prone to breakage, security fixes can be
delayed for an uncomfortably long time. One fix for this problem would be to
add a testing section to <tt>security.debian.org</tt>, but there has not been
any enthusiasm voiced in the thread so far about this option, probably because
it would involve a lot more work.
</p>

<p>
<b>Unstable news.</b> <tt>ifconfig</tt> was broken yesterday, to the point
where machines were unable to get up on the net. A fix will probably be in
the archive by the time you read this, and in the meanwhile there is a
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00011.html">
workaround</a>. A <a href="http://bugs.debian.org/85788"> regex memory leak
in libc</a> was accidentally introduced yesterday; symptoms include apt
<a href="http://bugs.debian.org/85820">eating up all memory</a>. And a
<a href="mail#1">large perl reorganization</a> is in the works: new perl
packages in Incoming incorporate many package name changes and other changes
that will require a recompile of all perl module packages.
</p>

<p>
<b>Four security updates have came out recently.</b>
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-027">Openssh</a> has a remote buffer
overflow bug which can lead to remote root access. The non-free ssh is also
vulnerable to the ssh holes, and as a fixed package is not available, 
upgrading to openssh is recommended. An
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00023.html">
omnibus security update</a> for the version of xfree86 in stable was released.
It corrects denial of service attacks, numerous buffer overflows, and 
numerous temporary files problems.
<a href="../../../../security/2001/dsa-028">man-db</a> has a format string
bug that allows local attackers to run code as user 'man'. Several denial
of service attacks against 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce-01/msg00022.html">
proftpd</a> were also fixed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Experimental and proposed-updates</b>, long two warts on the side of the
Debian archive, have moved into the package pool. The new setup should be
much cleaner. James Troup explained 
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce-0102/msg00009.html">
the details</a>.
