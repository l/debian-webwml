<p><b>토론</b></p>

<p>On the Debian-user mailing list, Debian user Jason asked
<a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/01/msg00212.html">how
to create a PDF-Printer from the command line</a>.

A large discussion covered many questions asking: Is (La)TeX text or not,
what exactly is a mimetype, why not a2ps or lp, and file bloat for PDF creation.
There are lots of tips and tricks throughout the thread for those wondering
about the same question.
</p>

<p>Debian user Richard Hector asked about the <a
href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2018/02/msg00073.html">policy
on the <q>wontfix</q> bug tag used by maintainers</a>.
The thread covered many topics and discussions about the actual output from the
date command, interactive shells, the question of <q>what day is it
really?</q>, the fuzzy grammar of the date string, parsers, mail LDOSUBSCRIBER, and the formail
component of procmail. A very interesting read!</p>
