<P><STRONG>******This document is under development*******</STRONG>

<P>People who have been around Open Software tend to develop very strong
opinions about licenses. Beginners don't worry about them as much
since they are more concerned with finishing the task at hand and
don't understand the long term implications of choosing software with
one license over another (it is doubtful that there
many people who understand the nuances of licensing that don't have
strong opinions on the matter).

<P>Over the years a number of licenses have gained prominence as they
give software authors the type of control over their creations that
most developers desire. It is still common to find software that has
no copyright visible or contains a unique license developer by the
author. The last can be quite annoying to distributors of software
(both on-line and people who create CDs) as many of these licenses
contain <A HREF="#mistakes">common mistakes</A> which make the software
difficult to distribute.

<P>What follows is a list of common Free (Open) software licenses and
some good and bad points of each.
Only the points in the license relevant to the discussion are shown.
Also, many points are listed under the heading "GOOD/BAD".
These are points that can be either good or bad, depending on your point of view.

<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU General Public License (GPL)</A>.
	<BR>
	<B>SUMMARY:</B> source code must be made available; software may be sold;
	derived works must use the same license
	<BR>
	<B>GOOD:</B> There is good reason this is the most used license for Free (Open)
	software. It does a good job of protecting the rights of software developers
	and the availability of source code guarantees that users won't have to worry
	about losing support in the future.
	<BR>
	<B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Software released using the GPL cannot be incorporated into
	commercial software.
	Whether this is actually a bad thing depends on your
	point of view. People developing commercial software often feel frustrated
	when there is a solution available that can't be used because of conflicts in
	licensing. Of course, there is nothing stopping them from
	contacting the author and seeing if they can buy a version using a different
	license.
	Most people who release software using the GPL do not consider these restrictions
	bad, because it allows others to use and improve the software while it prevents
	(for all practical purposes) others from making money off of their hard work
	without his permission. 

<LI>Artistic License
	<A HREF="http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html">http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html</A>.
	<BR>
	<B>SUMMARY:</B> 
	<BR>
	<B>GOOD:</B> 
	<BR>
	<B>BAD:</B> 

<LI><A HREF="../misc/bsd.license">BSD style license</A>.
	<BR>
	<B>SUMMARY:</B> Binaries and source code must contain the license;
		advertising must acknowledge the developers listed in the license
	<BR>
	<B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Companies that want an executable to be generally available
	   (possibly for free) without releasing the source code often like
	   this license. A good example is a company that wants to release a driver
	   for a graphics card. Open Source advocates would prefer that the company
	   release hardware specifications anyway. If the development of drivers
	   for XFree86 is indicative, the best drivers are those written with
	   source available. Companies are only making their products look bad by
	   releasing proprietary drivers that are slow and buggy. They can also
	   save development costs by letting others develop the driver for them.
	<BR>
	<B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Anyone may take the source, modify it, and release the
	   result without releasing the changes. Whether you think this is good or
	   bad is a personal preference.

<HR>

<P><A NAME="mistakes">Some common mistakes in self-written licenses</A>:
<UL>
<LI>Either not allowing, or restricting for-profit sale of the software.
	This makes it difficult to distribute the software on CD. People often
	make the mistake of using terms that are not well defined, such as 'reasonable cost'.
	It is better to simply use one of the licenses mentioned above as they accomplish
	the same thing without resorting to such phrases.   
	For example, by allowing anyone to distribute the software, the GPL keeps the
	costs down by the usual market forces. If someone is selling a CD with a high
	profit margin it won't be long before competitors enter the market and sell
	for a lower price.
	<BR>Note: the Artistic License does use the term `Reasonable copying fee', but
	qualifies the term in an attempt to make it less vague.
<LI>Not allowing distribution of modified versions of the software.
	This hinders distribution of the software by certain groups. For example, since
	Debian distributes compiled software, it is often necessary to modify the source
	to get it to compile or to make it comply with the
	<A HREF="ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/docs/linux-standards/fsstnd/">FSSTND</A>.
	But by doing this, we are then not allowed to distribute it.
<LI>Requiring that all changes to the software be reported to the author. While it is
	a good idea to report changes/improvements to the author so they can be more widely
	distributed, making it a requirement can cause problems. How many people know
	where they will be in 5 years?
	Simply change it to 'Any changes to the software should be reported to the author'.
	Most people will.
	<BR>This clause is usually included to prevent branch projects from developing.
	History has shown that, as long as development on the original code doesn't stall,
	branches will only succeed if some other force drives the split.
<LI>Stating that the software is public domain, but then adding constraints (such as
	not allowing sale for profit). Either something is public domain or it isn't - there
	is no middle ground. Such licenses are meaningless and it is likely that the extra
	conditions would not be upheld in court.
