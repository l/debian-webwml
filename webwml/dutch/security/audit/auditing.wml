<p>This page gives a rough overview of the steps necessary to conduct
 an audit of a package.</p>

<p>The first step is to actually choose a package to examine, you should
 pick one that's more critical to security.</p>
<p>See <a href="$(HOME)/security/audit/packages">the
list of packages that we think are most important to audit</a> for suggestions on how to make your decision.</p>
<p>One thing that should be made clear is that we are <i>not</i> trying
 to make sure that a package is only audited once.  If many people choose to
 examine the same package this is a good thing, as it demonstrates that 
 many people believe the package is security sensitive.</p>
<p>By allowing an essentially random selection of of packages we simplify
 coordination and we eliminate the problem of "how can you trust
person X to do a good job?"  (We don't need to as it is assumed that sooner
 or later somebody else will choose to examine the same program).</p>

<h2>Starting the audit</h2>
<p>After making your package selection you actually need to start the audit.</p>
<p>If you're not sure about the kind of problems you're looking for
 first start by reading a book on how to develop secure software.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs">Secure Programming for Linux and Unix HOWTO</a> has a lot of good information that can help you.</p>

<p>Although tools are imperfect, they can still be extremely helpful in finding likely vulnerabilities, See <a href="tools">the auditing tools page</a> for more information on some of the available auditing tools and how they are used.</p>
<p>As well as looking at the code itself it is a good idea to read the 
 documentation of the package itself, and try installing it and using it.</p>
<p>This might allow you to think of ways to subvert the program in
 its typical operation.</p>



<h2>Reporting Problems</h2>
<p>If you do discover a problem within the package that you are examining it
 then you should report it.</p>
<p>As security bugs shouldn't be disclosed generally until after they have 
been fixed <i>do not</i> report them via the standard <a
href="http://bugs.debian.org/">Debian Bug Tracking System</a>, instead
report the problem directly to <a href="$(HOME)/security/">the Security
Team</a> who will handle the release of an updated package.</p>
<p>Ideally each report should contain a fix for the problem which you have discovered, which has been tested and verified to actually close the problem.</p>
<p>If you do not have a fix then the more detail you can give on the scope of the problem, the relative severity of the issue and any workarounds the better.</p>
<p>The security team will coordinate with any other Linux Distributions if necessary and contact the package maintainer on your behalf.</p>
