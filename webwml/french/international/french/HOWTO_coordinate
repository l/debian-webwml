translations-bd.pl:

        This file is the database in Perl format. 

ltcp.pl :

        This is the Perl functions which compute
        fields when possible (more fields may be
        retrieve with more coding effort)

ltcp.body :

        The page source in WML where I've called the functions.

ltcp.wml :

        The classic skeleton where I've included ltcp.body

ltcp.fr.html :

        The result page ( too big at this time :-(, I may
        change these tools to split the result in more page )
