<P>
In Unix, any file that does not act as a general-purpose unit of storage
is called a <EM>special file</EM>.  These are FIFOs, Unix-domain sockets,
and device nodes.  In the Hurd, there is no need for the "special
file" distinction, since they are implemented by translators, just as
regular files are.


<P>
Nevertheless, the Hurd maintains this distinction, in order to provide
backward compatibility for Unix programs (which do not know about
translators).  Studying the implementation of Hurd special files is a
good way to introduce the idea of translators to people who are familiar
with Unix.


<P>
This chapter does not discuss <TT>`/dev/zero'</TT> or any of the
microkernel-based devices, since these are translated by the generalized
storeio server (FIXME xref).
