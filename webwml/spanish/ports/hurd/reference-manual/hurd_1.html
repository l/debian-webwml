<P>
The GNU Hurd<A NAME="DOCF1" HREF="hurd_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A> is the GNU Project's replacement for
the Unix kernel. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on the
Mach microkernel to implement file systems, network protocols, file
access control, and other features that are normally implemented by the
Unix kernel or similar kernels (such as Linux).




<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC2">Audience</A></H2>

<P>
This manual is designed to be useful to everybody who is interested in
using, administering, or programming the Hurd.


<P>
If you are an end-user and you are looking for help on running the Hurd,
the first few chapters of this manual describe the essential parts of
installing, starting up, and shutting down a Hurd workstation.  If you
need help with a specific program, the best way to use this manual is to
find the program's name in the index and go directly to the appropriate section.  You
may also wish to try running <KBD><VAR>program</VAR> --help</KBD>, which will
display a brief usage message for <VAR>program</VAR> (see section <A HREF="hurd_5.html#SEC21">Foundations</A>).


<P>
The rest of this manual is a technical discussion of the Hurd servers
and their implementation, and would not be helpful until you want to
learn how to modify the Hurd.


<P>
This manual is organized according to the subsystems of the Hurd, and each chapter begins
with descriptions of utilities and servers that are related to that
subsystem.  If you are a system administrator, and you want to learn
more about, say, the Hurd networking subsystem, you can skip to the
networking chapter (see section <A HREF="hurd_13.html#SEC126">Networking</A>), and read about the related
utilities and servers.


<P>
Programmers who are interested in learning how to modify Hurd servers, or
write new ones, should begin by learning about a microkernel to which the
Hurd has been ported (currently only GNU Mach) and reading
section <A HREF="hurd_5.html#SEC21">Foundations</A>.  You should then familiarize yourself with a
subsystem that interests you by reading about existing servers and the
libraries they use.  At that point, you should be able to study the
source code of existing Hurd servers and understand how they use the
Hurd libraries.


<P>
The final level of mastery is learning the RPC<A NAME="DOCF2" HREF="hurd_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A> interfaces which the Hurd
libraries implement.  The last section of each chapter describes any
Hurd interfaces used in that subsystem.  Those sections assume that you
are perusing the referenced interface definitions as you read.  After
you have understood a given interface, you will be in a good position to
improve the Hurd libraries, design your own interfaces, and implement
new subsystems.




<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC3">Features</A></H2>

<P>
The Hurd is not the most advanced operating system known to the planet
(yet), but it does have a number of enticing features:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT>it's free software
<DD>
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the GNU
General Public License (see section <A HREF="hurd_1.html#SEC6">GNU General Public License</A>).  The Hurd is part of the GNU
system, which is a complete operating system licensed under the GPL.

<DT>it's compatible
<DD>
The Hurd provides a familiar programming and user environment.  For all
intents and purposes, the Hurd is a modern Unix-like kernel.  The Hurd
uses the GNU C Library, whose development closely tracks standards such
as ANSI/ISO, BSD, POSIX, Single Unix, SVID, and X/Open.

<DT>it is built to survive
<DD>
Unlike other popular kernel software, the Hurd has an object-oriented
structure that allows it to evolve without compromising its design.
This structure will help the Hurd undergo major redesign and
modifications without having to be entirely rewritten.

<DT>it's scalable
<DD>
The Hurd implementation is aggressively multithreaded so that it runs
efficiently on both single processors and symmetric multiprocessors.
The Hurd interfaces are designed to allow transparent network clusters
(<EM>collectives</EM>), although this feature has not yet been implemented.

<DT>it's extensible
<DD>
The Hurd is an attractive platform for learning how to become a kernel
hacker or for implementing new ideas in kernel technology.  Every part
of the system is designed to be modified and extended.

<DT>it's stable
<DD>
It is possible to develop and test new Hurd kernel components without
rebooting the machine (not even accidentally).  Running your own kernel
components doesn't interfere with other users, and so no special system
privileges are required.  The mechanism for kernel extensions is secure
by design: it is impossible to impose your changes upon other users
unless they authorize them or you are the system administrator.

<DT>it exists
<DD>
The Hurd is real software that works Right Now.  It is not a research
project or a proposal.  You don't have to wait at all before you can
start using and developing it.

<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="hurd_toc.html#TOC5">History</A></H2>

<P>
Richard Stallman (RMS) started GNU in 1983, as a project to create a
complete free operating system.  In the text of the GNU Manifesto, he
mentioned that there is a primitive kernel.  In the first GNUsletter,
Feb. 1986, he says that GNU's kernel is TRIX, which was developed at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.


<P>
By December of 1986, the Free Software Foundation (FSF) had "started
working on the changes needed to TRIX" [Gnusletter, Jan. 1987].
Shortly thereafter, the FSF began "negotiating with Professor Rashid of
Carnegie-Mellon University about working with them on the development of
the Mach kernel" [Gnusletter, June, 1987].  The text implies that the
FSF wanted to use someone else's work, rather than have to fix TRIX.


<P>
In [Gnusletter, Feb. 1988], RMS was talking about taking Mach and
putting the Berkeley Sprite filesystem on top of it, "after the parts
of Berkeley Unix... have been replaced."


<P>
Six months later, the FSF is saying that "if we can't get Mach, we'll
use TRIX or Berkeley's Sprite."  Here, they present Sprite as a
full-kernel option, rather than just a filesystem.


<P>
In January, 1990, they say "we aren't doing any kernel work.  It does
not make sense for us to start a kernel project now, when we still hope
to use Mach" [Gnusletter, Jan. 1990].  Nothing significant occurs until
1991, when a more detailed plan is announced:



<PRE>
``We are still interested in a multi-process kernel running on top of
Mach. The CMU lawyers are currently deciding if they can release Mach
with distribution conditions that will enable us to distribute it. If
they decide to do so, then we will probably start work. CMU has
available under the same terms as Mach a single-server partial Unix
emulator named Poe; it is rather slow and provides minimal
functionality. We would probably begin by extending Poe to provide full
functionality. Later we hope to have a modular emulator divided into
multiple processes.'' [Gnusletter, Jan. 1991].

RMS explains the relationship between the Hurd and Linux in
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-and-linux.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-and-linux.html</A>, where he
mentions that the FSF started developing the Hurd in 1990.  As of
[Gnusletter, Nov. 1991], the Hurd (running on Mach) is GNU's official
kernel.
