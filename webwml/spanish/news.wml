<h2><a name="19980826e">26 Aug 1998: Additional Vendors Participate in Growing LSB Effort</a></h2>
<h3>Additional Vendors Participate in Growing LSB Effort</h3>

<h4>LCS founders join the LSB project</h4>

<p>We are happy to announce that the founders of the Linux Compatibility
Standards (LCS) Project, a collaboration of Debian and Red Hat, will
work on Linux standards as part of the LSB effort.  Now that the LSB
Project combines the original focus of the LSB with the goals of the
LCS, the LCS founders see no need for any separate standardization
effort.

<h4>LSB elects new chair and forms 3 technical sub-projects</h4>

<p>After Bruce Perens departed on August 10th, it was necessary to find a
new chair for the LSB organization.  It was felt by several vendors that
such a chair should be impartial and thus not from any Linux vendor.
The new chair of the LSB Steering Committee is Daniel Quinlan (head of
the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard <http://www.pathname.com/fhs/>).

<p>Originally, the focus of the LSB project was to produce a Linux
reference platform that would define a standard Linux.  Any program that
ran successfully on the reference platform could be expected to run on
all compliant Linux systems.  An LSB written standard and test suite
were secondary goals.

<p>As discussion of how to develop the reference platform continued, it
became obvious that without active work on a written standard and a test
suite, that the LSB project wouldn't be successful in achieving its
goals.  Therefore, the LSB project has now reorganized into three
technical sub-committee projects of equal importance, each with a
prominent technical lead.

<ul>
  <li>LSB written standard
    Technical lead: Stuart Anderson (Metro Link, Inc.)

  <li>LSB test suite
    Technical lead: Dale Scheetz (Debian)

  <li>LSB sample implementation
    Technical lead: Ralf Flaxa (Caldera)
</ul>

<p>These three groups will work together to develop a base standard for the
Linux operating system as follows:

<ul>
  <li> The test suite must match the written standard.

  <li> A conformant distribution (such as the sample implementation) must
    pass the test suite and follow the written standard.

  <li> Conformant applications should run on the any distribution that
    passes the test suite.
</ul>

<p>And when the above is not true, then something needs to be fixed.  If it
can't be figured out by the technical groups, then the steering
committee will arbitrate.

<p>Finally, the sample implementation will be composed entirely of free
software and the test suite will be as free as the LSB can make it
without rendering the test suite meaningless.

<h4>New LSB web site</h4>

There is now a web site for the LSB project:

  <a href="http://www.linuxbase.org/">http://www.linuxbase.org/</a>.

<h4>About the Linux Standard Base</h4>

<p>The Linux Standard Base (LSB) is developing a set of standards that will
increase compatibility among Linux distributions and enable software
applications to run on any compliant Linux system.  The LSB will also
help coordinate efforts to recruit software vendors to port and write
products for Linux.

<p>We have also created several open mailing lists (for more information,
please see the LSB web site).  The public "at large" are encouraged to
subscribe to these lists, with a request that non-committee members
"lurk" quietly.

<p>The list of individuals and organizations participating in the LSB
effort or endorsing the LSB includes:

<ul>
 <li> Alan Cox, Building Number Three
 <li> Caldera, Inc.
 <li> Enhanced Software Technologies, Inc.
 <li> Eric S. Raymond, open<li>source evangelist, and author of
   "The Cathedral and the Bazaar"
 <li> Evan Leibovitch, Chair of 86open Project
 <li> Jon A. Hall, Executive Director, Linux International
 <li> Linux Hardware Solutions, Inc.
 <li> Metro Link, Inc.
 <li> Pacific HiTech (TurboLinux)
 <li> Phil Hughes, Director Linux International, Publisher of Linux Journal
 <li> Red Hat Software, Inc.
 <li> S.u.S.E. GmbH
 <li> Software in the Public Interest
 <li> The Debian Project
 <li> VA Research
</ul>

<h2><a name="19980826d">26 Aug 1998: Debian in Print: Databases with Linux</a></h2>
<P>The German book 'Databases with Linux' by Dr. Bernhard Roehrig contains a complete 
Debian distribution as well as four database systems and examples to 
experiment with and use as a basis for development.  More information can be 
found at
<a href="http://www.cul.de/">http://www.cul.de/</a> (site is in German).

Databases with Linux [Datenbanken mit Linux]<br>
Adabas - mSQL - Postgres - Yard-SQL<br>
Dr. Bernhard Roehrig

<p>The start of the journey into the Information Age has begun.  Those who do 
not merely want to be there but also want to help define trends must be 
faster than the others.  Above all, they must be in a position to provide 
information more quickly.  This information must be current, well 
structured, and provided in an appropriate format to the consumer.

<p>The book deals with these issues and shows how to use the Freeware operating 
system Linux and several Database management systems to provide extremely 
price effective solutions for local networks and the Internet.

<p>Well, maybe not quite live... but we are included in the picture with

<h3>Newsgathering on the Net.</h3>
By Internet Correspondent Chris Nuttall 
 
<p>As a foreign correspondent, I was always inspired by the quote that people 
like us were "writing the first draft of history." Now I am an Internet 
correspondent, I have been deservedly humbled by the realisation that even 
the most crafted online pieces really only amount to the first draft of a 
story.

<p>Several examples in the past week show that while the Internet can be the 
source of unfounded rumours and ill-researched stories, it can also repair 
any such damage, in the end creating something more solid and substantial 
than is possible in any other medium.

<h2><a name="19980826b">26 Aug 1998: Debian ARM Project</a></h2>
<p>The Debian GNU/Linux ARM distribution is a port of Debian to the ARM 
architecture and will run on Corel's NetWinder.  Development will eventually 
target other ARM processors as well.  The ARM port will likely be included 
in the next distribution of Debian.

<p>Corel Computer Corp.'s NetWinder network computers are based on the 
powerful, scalable, open source Linux OS.  They deliver the computing power,
speed, and reliability needed for both end-user and server applications.
 
<p>"Corel Computer is very impressed with the quality and speed of the Debian
development efforts," said Chris Herrnberger, NetWinder product development
manager. "The work is greatly appreciated and sets a high standard for other
NetWinder developers to follow."

<p>Information on the current status of the distribution can be found at 
<a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/arm/">http://www.debian.org/ports/arm/</a>.
Information on other distributions is also available at
<a href="http://www.debian.org/ports/">http://www.debian.org/ports/</a>.

<p>We would like to thank Corel for providing developers with a machine to work 
on, and for their technical support.  Thanks also to the Ottawa-Carleton
Linux Users Group (OCLUG) for hosting the machines.

<h2><a name="19980826c">26 Aug 1998: Debian in the News: APCMAG 2.0 'Hamm' Beta Review</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<h3>Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 Beta</h3>

<p>One of the problems with early Linux distributions such as SLS and
Slackware was the workload they imposed upon those maintaining
them. The kernel itself was still undergoing rapid change, and
high-level components were growing both in number and complexity.

<p>The Debian Linux distribution was conceived to address this problem, by 
using a volunteer development model similar to that used by Torvalds in the 
creation of the kernel itself. This has spread the workload more evenly 
throughout the Linux community. It has also provided Linux enthusiasts with 
the opportunity to participate closely in the development of the 
distribution.

<p>...<br>

While not receiving the same level of attention from the mainstream media as 
some commercial distributions, Debian Linux is a solid, comprehensive 
product, and a genuine pleasure to use. It is also great to become involved 
with the Debian collective, whose friendliness and spirit recalls the early 
days of the Internet and its sense of openness and global cooperation.

A New Stable Release of Debian<br>
by Larry Ayers

<p>In 1993 Ian Murdock created the Debian Linux distribution, initially under 
the auspices of the Free Software Foundation's GNU project. Although the 
direct connection with FSF/GNU is a thing of the past, Debian is still the 
only major distribution which is not connected with a commercial entity and 
which is maintained solely by a loosely-knit band of volunteers. The 
parallels with Linux itself make this distribution appealing to Linux users 
who value the ideals of the free-software world, including those who may 
disagree with the purist views of the FSF.

<h2><a name="19980813c">13 Aug 1998: Debian's 5th Birthday!</a></h2>
<p>On Sunday, August 16, 1998, Debian will turn a proud 5 years old. 
There will be an IRC party on irc.debian.org (also irc.openprojects.net) 
channel #debian on Sunday August 16 at 20:00 UTC.  Please join us for the 
festivities!

<p>From its beginnings in 1993 with about a dozen developers, Debian has 
grown into a strong organization that develops one of the world's leading 
Linux distributions.  The recently released the 2.0 'Hamm' distribution
(see <a href="http://www.debian.org/news#19980724">http://www.debian.org/news#19980724</a>)
was developed by over 400 developers 
and  contains over 1500 entirely free packages.

<p>Work on several ports is currently in progress.  PowerPC, Alpha, Sparc, 
UltraSparc, ARM, m68k, i386-hurd and more are currently under active 
development.  For more information regarding these ports, please visit our 
web page at <a href="http://www.debian.org/">http://www.debian.org/</a>.

<p>Plans for the future include moving towards FHS compliance, as well as 
introducing 'apt,' our next generation package manager.  Apt enables system 
administrators to keep their systems in sync with the latest available 
software using just a few simple commands to automatically retrieve the 
latest versions of packages from the Internet, and install and configure 
them.

<p>Debian is working together with Red Hat and other organizations and 
individuals from the Linux community in developing the Linux Compatibility 
Standard (LCS). To subscribe to the lcs-eng mailing list send an e-mail to 
<a href="mailto:lcs-eng-REQUEST@lists.debian.org">lcs-eng-REQUEST@lists.debian.org</a>
with the single word 'subscribe' in the subject line.

<p>Debian would like to thank all the people who have made this distribution 
grow and prosper.  These include the founder Ian Murdock, leaders Bruce 
Perens and Ian Jackson, and all of the developers that have put in countless 
hours of volunteer work.  Debian would not be possible without you. Thank 
you!

<h3>Some History</h3>
<p>Debian has had several leaders since its beginnings in 1993.
<ul>
 <li>Ian Murdock founded Debian in August 1993 and led it until March 1996.
     This effort was sponsored by the FSF's GNU project for one year 
     (November 1994 to November 1995). 
 <li>Bruce Perens led Debian from April 1996 until December 1997
 <li>Ian Jackson led Debian from January 1998 until the present
</ul>

<p>Here are a few of the major Debian release milestones:
<ul>
 <li>0.01-0.90 were released between August 1993 and December 1993
 <li>0.91 released January 1994 (~30 developers, primitive packager)
 <li>0.93R5 released in March 1995 (dpkg makes its first appearance)
 <li>0.93R6 released in November 1995 (~60 developers, a.out, first dselect)
 <li>1.0 was never released. It later became version 1.1
 <li>1.1 'Buzz' released June 1996 (474 packages, 2.0 kernel, fully ELF, dpkg)
 <li>1.2 'Rex' released December 1996 (848 packages, 120 developers)
 <li>1.3 'Bo' released July 1997 (974 packages, 200 developers)
 <li>2.0 'Hamm' released July 1998 (1500+ packages, 400+ developers, glibc2)
 <li>2.1 'Slink' is scheduled to be frozen in October or November 1998.
</ul>

<h2><a name="19980811">11 Aug 1998: Announcing the Linux Compatibility Standards Project</a></h2>
<p>Debian and Red Hat are collaborating on a written specification of the
"Linux Compatibility Standard" (LCS). The LCS will clearly outline the
specifications necessary to be LCS compliant. This LCS document will be
used as a guideline on how to build a "proper" system by those building
Linux distributions, and it will be used by developers needing information
on the basic system configuration to develop application programs.
We expect this LCS effort to complement the example LSB implementation
on which Bruce Perens is working.

<p>Erik Troan (Red Hat) and Dale Scheetz (Debian) will jointly manage the LCS
working group, which will be working on the written standard using the
lcs-eng@lists.debian.org mailing list for the discussion.

<p>lcs-eng@lists.debian.org is an open subscription list. Everyone who is
interested is encouraged to subscribe. Most of all, we encourage all current
members of the LSB committee to subscribe to this list. Even if you intend
to work on the code base, subscribing will be helpful.

<p>The public "at large" is also encouraged to subscribe, with only one
suggestion. All non-committee members will be STRONGLY encouraged to "lurk"
quietly. If you really have information of pressing importance to the
group, you are encouraged to subscribe to the debian-policy mailing list
and carry your discussion to that group. All LCS discussions on
debian-policy will be collected periodically for review by the LCS group.

<h3>Subscribing</h3>
To subscribe to the lcs-eng mailing list send an e-mail to:
<pre>
        lcs-eng-REQUEST@lists.debian.org

with the single word subscribe in the subject line. You will shortly receive
a confirmation request. Follow the instructions and you will become
subscribed to the list.

<h2><a name="19980724">24 Jul 1998: Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Released</a></h2>
<p>Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' has officially been released for the i386 
and m68k architectures.

<p>It can be obtained in several ways:
<ul>
<li>FTP:       <a href="ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/">ftp://ftp.debian.org/pub/debian/</a>
<li>CD-ROM:    <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors</a> (list of distributors)
<li>CD Images: <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">http://cdimage.debian.org/</a>
</ul>

<p>Debian 2.0 contains over 1500 precompiled binary packages contributed 
from over 400 developers, including all of the favorites: web servers, 
GIMP, gcc, egcs, XFree86, SQL servers and many other tools and utilities.
It also marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.

<p>Debian's powerful package manager 'dpkg' allows for easy installation, 
maintenance and updating of packages including sophisticated handling of
dependencies and configurations.  Packages from other distributions can 
easily be installed using the 'alien' utility.

<p>Debian development distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also 
available under the 'unstable' tree from the FTP site.  They will likely
be released with Debian 2.1 'Slink.'  Development is currently in 
progress for UltraSparc, Netwinder and Hurd based distributions.


<h3>Why Debian GNU/Linux?</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Debian is 100% Free Software. Our goal is to help keep Linux free.
 <li>Over 1500 precompiled software packages.
 <li>Over 400 developers, the largest staff of any Linux distribution.
 <li>The largest pre-release testing program in the Linux world.
 <li>Free on-line support from our large, friendly user community on the
   debian-user mailing list and interactive chat forums.
 <li>Floppy-less install directly from CD, or single floppy install
   using NFS or hard disk.
 <li>Automatic upgrades via CD, FTP, NFS, or disk.
 <li>Bug tracking system is publicly accessible on our web server, and
   users are encouraged to access the system and provide feedback.
 <li>Anyone can duplicate and sell our Official CD or a snapshot of the
   FTP archive, at no charge!
 <li>Compatible with RPM and Slackware packages.
</ul>


<h3>Upgrade Information</h3>

<p>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp 
(due to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), a specific upgrade procedure is 
recommended.  This document describing this procedure can be found at:
<blockquote>
   <a href="http://www.debian.org/2.0/HOWTO.upgrade">http://www.debian.org/2.0/HOWTO.upgrade</a>
</blockquote>

There are several ways to upgrade from an earlier version:
<ol>
  <li>autoup.sh<br>
       This is a script that will upgrade the programs in the
     correct order, and even download the deb's for you.  Because
     of the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
     packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
     released is provided.  This is in the developers corner
     of the Debian web site, but newer versions are at:
     <ul>

<h2><a name="19980624">24 Jun 1998: Debian v2.0 ("Hamm") Beta Test</a></h2>
<p>Though significantly delayed, Debian 2.0 ("Hamm") has officially been released
as "beta" for the i386 and m68k architectures.  The packages on ftp.debian.org
are up to date and ready for downloads.  Mirror sites are busy catching up on
the last few changes and should be complete by the end of the day (Thursday
morning at the absolute latest).

<p>Debian 2.0 marks the move from the older libc5 to the newer libc6.  Since
this is a significant change, we took a long time to make sure everything
was working correctly.

<p>Changes to Hamm are restricted to important bug fixes so you should encounter
relatively few changes between now and the official release.  I would
encourage those interested to go ahead with the Debian 1.3 ("Bo") to 2.0
upgrade.  This final bit of testing should help eliminate the remaining
upgrade/install problems likely to be encountered.

<p>Debian distributions for Alpha, Sparc, and PowerPC are also available under
the "unstable" tree.  They will likely release with Debian 2.1.

<p>To avoid problems in just upgrading packages via dpkg, dselect, or dftp (due
to possible libc5/libc6 conflicts), it is recommended that the following
upgrade procedure be followed.  This document can be found at

<a href="http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq">http://bhmit1.home.ml.org/deb/faq</a>
and
<a href="2.0/upgrade.faq">on the current site</a>.

<p>Q: How do I upgrade from an earlier version of Debian?<BR>
A: There are several methods:
   <OL>
   <li>autoup.sh - This is a script that will upgrade the programs in
      the correct order, even download the deb's for you.  Because of
      the continuing changes to the archive, a tar archive of the
      packages that were available at the time autoup.sh was last
      released is provided. 
      Versions are available at:<BR>
      <a href="2.0/autoup/">the current site</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/">http://www.taz.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/">http://debian.vicnet.net.au/autoup/</a><BR>
      <a href="http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/">http://www.uk.debian.org/autoup/</a>
         (ftp: also okay)
   <li>apt-get - This is the command line part of Debian's future
      package manager.  It knows how to order packages and will
      download them from a local archive, http, and ftp sites.  It is
      able to merge the info from several sites, so you can use your
      cd, an up to date mirror, and a non-us site for the best mix of
      speed, variety, and recentness (if you can't tell, I like this
      one).  Just run 'apt-get update; apt-get dist-upgrade'.  The bo
      version is at: <a href="http://www.debian.org/~jgg/">http://www.debian.org/~jgg/</a>
      and <a href="2.0/apt-get.gz">on the current site</a>.
      The hamm version is in project/experimental.
   <li>Do it by hand.  There is a howto at:
      <a href="http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html">http://www.gate.net/~storm/FAQ/libc5-libc6-Mini-HOWTO.html</a>

      want to do this.

<h2><a name="19980606">6 Jun 1998: Kachina Technologies, Inc. to help Debian Sparc
       development</a></h2>
<p>Kachina Technologies, Inc. (<a href="http://kachinatech.com">http://kachinatech.com</a>)
has decided to help 
make the Debian Sparc distribution commercially available to Linux 
community.  When ready, the Debian GNU/Linux 2.0 'Hamm' Sparc distribution 
will be offered by Kachina on both CD-ROM and on preinstalled systems as 
well.

<p>When asked about their work with Linux, Ward Deng of Kachina stated:

<p>"[Kachina] has been working on UltraSPARC systems and Linux for many years 
and realized UltraSPARC and Linux is the best combination for 
high-performance computing users. We have demonstrated an UltraLinux cluster 
at a trade show and drew a lot of attention.

<p>"We have been working on a native port of high-performance development 
environment including Fujitsu Fortran 90, C, and other compiler/tools on the 
Linux/UltraSPARC platform.

<p>"We have been supporting UltraLinux port by providing loan systems to key 
Sparc/Linux developers and we will continue doing so. Not only we will 
provide remote access and network resource to Debian/UltraLinux developers, 
we also intend to provide developers or early users preloaded systems at 
prices below their costs to show our support and appreciation."

<p>When asked why Debian was the distribution of choice, the reply was:

<p>"Debian is obviously the best distribution so far. The Debian packaging 
system and its organized volunteer-based development made it more 
maintainable and guaranteed its openness in a long run."

<p>Kachina is providing Internet access, disk space, a publicly accessible 
test system, as well as manpower on software packaging and testing to help 
the Debian Sparc effort.

<p>Kachina also hosts Scientific Applications on Linux (SAL) 
(http://sal.kachinatech.com), which is a collection of information and links 
to software that is useful to scientists and engineers.

<p>Debian GNU/Linux has been working on a Sparc distribution since November 
1996.  This distribution is expected to be ready for release within the next 
few months.

<p>For more information regarding Debian Sparc development, please subscribe to 
the Debian Sparc mailing list

<h2><a name="19980408">9 Apr 1998: Debian to Use Only Free Versions of the X Window
          System</a></h2>
<p>We are dismayed by the recent decision by the `Open Group' not to
release future versions of X as free software - there will be
restrictions on commercial use, including large fees.

<p>Debian's Social Contract promises that we will only promote software
which meets our Free Software Guidelines.  These Guidelines require
availability for commercial as well as noncommercial use.

<p>Debian cannot therefore ship versions of X derived from X11R6.4.
Instead we will base our releases on X11R6.3 (which is free);
we are confident that the free software community will rise to the
challenge of developing further free versions based on X11R6.3.

<p>We note that XFree86 are currently considering their response to this
situation.  We sincerely hope that they will retain their alignment
with the fully-free software community by not putting further work
into the new closed X distribution from the `Open Group'.

<p>We would also encourage commercial vendors (whether aligned with the
free software community or not) to express their commitment to keep X
free.

<p>The duplication of effort and loss of standardization involved in
splitting the development of X is unfortunate, but has been made
inevitable by the Open Group's decision to take X away from the free
software community.

<h2><a name="19980325">25 Mar 1998: Code freeze (and rumours)</a></h2>
<p>The following is a message from the leader of Debian, Ian Jackson:
<blockquote>
<p>The codefreeze for Debian 2.0, the libc6 system, is now in place,
and alpha and beta testing will start very soon.

<p>There has been some confusion regarding Bruce Perens's relationship
with SPI (Software in the Public Interest, Debian's support and
umbrella organization).  Bruce is the President of SPI, and felt he
was unhappy with certain aspects of the Debian Project's work.  Ian
Murdock, Tim Sailer and I - the other board members of SPI - are
currently discussing with Bruce the future direction of SPI, and SPI's
relationship with Debian, and there is an ongoing discussion within
the Debian Project about these issues.

<p>However, this will not distract us from our progress towards releasing
2.0.  The Debian Project has a long tradition of apparent political
instability shortly before making releases, so you can be optimistic !

<h2><a name="19980306a">6 Mar 1998: Announcement About the Debian Trademark</a></h2>
<p>Debian's goal is to be fair to all businesses. Part of that is not
giving one business an advantage over another.

<p>We allow all businesses to make reasonable use of the "Debian" trademark.
For example, if you make a CD of our Debian GNU/Linux distribution,
you can call that product "Debian". If you want to use the name in some
other way, you should ask us _first_.

<p>To be fair to all businesses, we insist that no business use the name
"Debian" in the name of the business, or a domain name of the business.

<p>A few times well-meaning people have called us just a bit too late to
keep them from losing a few hundred dollars and some time and being
disappointed. In all cases these people have meant well, and have
approached us with gifts in hand, and it is a shame to disappoint them.
Hopefully, this warning will protect the next person.

<h2><a name="19980306b">6 Mar 1998: Netscape turns to Debian for Licensing Guidance!</a></h2>

write their license. You can find the draft Netscape license at
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/">http://www.mozilla.org/NPL/</a>.
This is a historic day for us, since it
means that Netscape will eventually be in the "main" part of Debian
and all Linux systems, not the "non-free" section any longer!

be found at the bottom of that page. The Debian Social Contract and

<p>There is work yet to be done - a few license bug-lets will be resolved
within the next few days, and once the source code is released there are
some parts that Netscape does not own that will probably have to be
replaced with free software.

<h2><a name="19980223">23 Feb 1998: MAPS: A Project Worthy of your Notice</a></h2>
<p>Like most heavy Internet users, Debian developers have been plagued by
e-mail "spam". Recently, spammers have been even been posting messages
to our online bug-reporting system. Sales messages have been popping up
in between the bug reports.

<p>Because of this, the Debian servers have joined MAPS, the Mail Abuse
Protection System. This is a network of system administrators that agree
to voluntarily refuse e-mail from sites that support spammers or have
poor anti-spam policies. Their web site is at
<a href="http://www.vix.com/">http://www.vix.com/</a>. MAPS
operates the Realtime Blackhole List. This is a system that allows them
to update the list of systems we refuse mail from instantly, and that
gives them the power to stop a spam in progress. Because so many systems
are participating, MAPS can get the attention of the offending sites and
can persuade them to reform their spam policies. MAPS also operates the
Transport Security Initiative, a program to educate innocent sites that
are used as relays by spammers in how to block spam.

<p>MAPS has improved the entire Internet, and it's worthy of your support.
We are working on improvements to the Debian mail programs so that Debian

<h2><a name="19980125b">25 Jan 1998: Debian Stability</a></h2>
<p>Debian's "master" system is a Pentium 90 with 64MB graciously provided
by one of our donors, Novare, who also donate its site in Texas, its support,
and its internet connection. It delivers over 100,000 e-mails daily,
runs the CVS server for the GNOME project, is our master FTP server
with many mirror systems accessing it every day, hosts our bug reporting
system and many project utilities, and is the "home" system of our 200
developers, who compile, upload, and download using that system every day.
This is a heavier load than people put on a single commercial workstation
running anything but Linux. A Microsoft NT system with a Pentium Pro and
128MB RAM would not approach the load this system handles effortlessly every
day. The system just ran continuously for three months without a reboot.

<p>The following quote is from Bruce Perens (past president of Debian and
board member of SPI) who works at Pixar:
<blockquote>I thought three months without a reboot was a big deal. When I mentioned
it to our developers, one of them showed me details about his system. It
was up for 458 days, and was halted to move it to another floor. The network
and disk device drivers had handled tens of millions of interrupts in that
time.</blockquote>

New Year's Day 1970. This counter will overflow about 40 years from now,
in early 2038, _not_ 2000.

<p>The few Debian applications that stored 2-digit dates have already been
repaired, and Debian systems have passed testing with their dates set
at 2000 and greater. There is one area in which Debian 1.3 is affected
but our upcoming 2.0 release will not be. Your PC's BIOS may only allow
you to set the PC's clock chip to a 2-digit date. This is a bug in your
PC's BIOS ROM, but we will provide a work-around in Debian so that you
don't have to buy a new motherboard. If you expect to run your 1.3 system
through the millennium, you can get a copy of the "hwclock" program from
2.0 and replace the "clock" program presently on your system.

<p>Before 2038 we must define "time_t", to be a 64-bit variable instead of
a 32-bit one, and recompile all programs. This is a very simple process
compared to the anguish the non-Unix world is going through - we go
through more work to produce a major release of Debian. Once time_t is
a 64 bit variable, it's good for roughly another 292271023017 years. By then,
there may be something better than Debian :-)

<h2><a name="19980101">1 Jan 1998: Happy New Year from the Debian Project</a></h2>
<p>1998 brings some changes for the Debian project. Ian Jackson is now
Debian project leader. Bruce Perens will continue as president of Software in the
Public Interest, Inc., and will work on such things as funding worthy
free software projects, external communications for the Debian project,
Open Hardware, and another SPI software project that might eventually be
as big as Debian.
