<H1>Comparaci&oacute;n de las Licencias de Software</H1>

<P>Las personas que han estado alrededor del Software Abierto tienden
a desarrollar unas opiniones muy fuertes acerca de las licencias.  Los
novatos no se preocupan de esto dado que est&aacute;n m&aacute;s preocupados sobre
terminar el trabajo que est&aacute;n haciendo y no se preocupan de las
implicaciones a largo plazo de elegir un software con unas licencias
sobre otro (es dudoso que hay muchas personas que entiendan las pegas
de licenciar no tengan fuertes opiniones sobre la materia).


<P>A trav&eacute;s de los a&ntilde;os un n&uacute;mero de licencias han ganado prominencia
al dar a los autores de software el tipo de control sobre sus
creaciones que la mayor&iacute;a de los desarrolladores desean. A&uacute;n es com&uacute;n
encontrar software que no tiene copyright visible o que contiene una
licencia &uacute;nica desarrollada por el autor. Lo &uacute;ltimo puede ser bastante
fastidioso para los distribuidores de software (tanto en l&iacute;nea como
las personas que hacen CDs) dado que muchas de estas licencias
contienen <A HREF="#mistakes">errores com&uacute;nes</A> que hacen a este
software dif&iacute;cil de distribuir.

<P>What follows is a list of common Free (Open) software licenses and
some good and bad points of each.
Only the points in the license relevant to the discussion are shown.
Also, many points are listed under the heading "GOOD/BAD".
These are points that can be either good or bad, depending on your point of view.

<UL>
<LI>The <A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU General Public License (GPL)</A>.
    <BR>
    <B>SUMMARY:</B> source code must be made available; software may be sold;
    derived works must use the same license
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD:</B> There is good reason this is the most used license for Free (Open)
    software. It does a good job of protecting the rights of software developers
    and the availability of source code guarantees that users won't have to worry
    about losing support in the future.
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Software released using the GPL can not be incorporated into
    commercial software.
    Whether this is actually a bad thing depends on your
    point of view. People developing commercial software often feel frustrated
    when there is a solution available that can't be used because of conflicts in
    licensing. Of course, there is nothing stopping them from
    contacting the author and seeing if they can buy a version using a different
    license.
    Anyone who releases software using the GPL does not consider these restrictions
    bad, because it prevents others from making money off of their hard work while
    allowing others to use it.

<LI>Artistic License
    <A HREF="http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html">http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html</A>.
    <BR>
    <B>SUMMARY:</B> 
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD:</B> 
    <BR>
    <B>BAD:</B> 

<LI><A HREF="../misc/bsd.license">BSD style license</A>.
    <BR>
    <B>SUMMARY:</B> Binaries and source code must contain the license;
        advertising must acknowledge the developers listed in the license
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Companies that want an executable to be generally available
       (possibly for free) without releasing the source code often like
       this license. A good example is a company that wants to release a driver
       for a graphics card. Open Source advocates would prefer that the company
       release hardware specifications anyway. If the development of drivers
       for XFree86 is indicative, the best drivers are those written with
       source available. Companies are only making their products look bad by
       releasing proprietary drivers that are slow and buggy. They can also
       save development costs by letting others develop the driver for them.
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD/BAD:</B> Anyone may take the source, modify it, and release the
       result without releasing the changes. Whether you think this is good or
       bad is a personal preference.

<LI><A HREF="../misc/modified.bsd.license">Modified BSD license</A>.
    <BR>
    <B>SUMMARY:</B> Just like the BSD license above except the advertising
    clause has been removed.
    <BR>
    <B>GOOD:</B> With the development of Linux distributions large
       collections of software distributed. Under the advertising clause
       of the BSD license all the developers must be listed in all advertising.
       This becomes ridiculous as the number of developers grows into the
       thousands. Thus many people are advocating the use of a  modified
       version of the BSD style license without this clause.

<A name="mistakes">
Some common mistakes in self-written licenses:
<UL>
<LI>Either not allowing, or restricting for-profit sale of the software.
    This makes it difficult to distribute the software on CD. People often
    make the mistake of using terms that are not well defined, such as 'reasonable cost'.
    It is better to simply use one of the licenses mentioned above as they accomplish
    the same thing without resorting to such phrases.   
    For example, by allowing anyone to distribute the software, the GPL keeps the
    costs down by the usual market forces. If someone is selling a CD with a high
    profit margin it won't be long before competitors enter the market and sell
    for a lower price.
    <BR>Note: the Artistic License does use the term `Reasonable copying fee', but
    qualifies the term in an attempt to make it less vague.
<LI>Not allowing distribution of modified versions of the software.
    This hinders distribution of the software by certain groups. For example, since
    Debian distributes compiled software, it is often necessary to modify the source
    to get it to compile or to make it comply with the
    <A HREF="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">FHS</A>.
    But by doing this, we are then not allowed to distribute it.
<LI>Requiring that all changes to the software be reported to the author. While it is
    a good idea to report changes/improvements to the author so they can be more widely
    distributed, making it a requirement can cause problems. How many people know
    where they will be in 5 years?
    Simply change it to 'Any changes to the software should be reported to the author'.
    Most people will.
    <BR>This clause is usually included to prevent branch projects from developing.
    History has shown that as long as development on the original code doesn't stall
    branches only succeed if there are other forces driving the split.
<LI>Stating that the software is public domain, but then adding constraints (such as
    not allowing sale for profit). Either something is public domain or it isn't - there
    is no middle ground. Such licenses are meaningless and it is likely that the extra
    conditions would not be upheld in court.
