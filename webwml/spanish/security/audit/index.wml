<p>The Debian Securit Audit Project is a small project which is focussed upon auditing the packages which are available within the Debian Stable release, with an aim to finding security holes.</p>
<p>In its short existance it has been responsible for several <a href="/security/">DSAs</a>, and it is hoped more will continue to result from this work.</p>
<p>By taking a proactive stance in auditing code we help to ensure that Debian continues its long history of taking security seriously.</p>
