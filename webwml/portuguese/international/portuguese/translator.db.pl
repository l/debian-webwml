# Here is the syntax:
#  The data is in a hash table returned by init_translators().
#  Each key is the name of a translator (trimmed, without email adress)
#  For each one, you have a (sub)hash table containing:
#  * email:    the current email of this guy
#  * compress: which type of compression you want to have (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
#  Remaining keys have numeric value, which tells when to send info:
#  * summary:  a summary of which documents are outdated
#  * logs:     the cvs log' between the translated and current versions
#  * diff:     idem with diff
#  * file:     add current version of translated file
