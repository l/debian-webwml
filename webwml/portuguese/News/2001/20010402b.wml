<p>Recently, the Debian Project has lost two members of its "family".
Chris Rutter was killed in a tragic car accident and Fabrizio Polacco
passed away after a long illness.  Chris was maintaining the ARM port
of Debian, and the next ARM release will be dedicated to him.
Fabrizio maintained several important packages within the Debian
Project and had become upstream maintainer for man-db.

<p>The Debian Project honors their good work and strong dedication to
Debian and Free Software.  The contributions of both Chris and
Fabrizio will not be forgotten, and other developers will step forward
to continue their work.

<p>Chris Rutter and Fabrizio Polacco will both be missed.
