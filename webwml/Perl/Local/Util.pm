	use base qw( Exporter );

	our @EXPORT_OK = qw( uniq read_file );
	our %EXPORT_TAGS = ( 'all' => [@EXPORT_OK] );
}


=item uniq

Returns a new list by stripping duplicate values in LIST. The order of elements
in the returned list is the same as in LIST. In scalar context, returns the
number of unique elements in LIST.

Example use:

    my @x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 1 2 3 5 4
    my $x = uniq 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 3, 4; # returns 5


This code was copied literally from List::MoreUtils.

=cut
sub uniq (@) 
{
	my %h;
	map { $h{$_}++ == 0 ? $_ : () } @_;
}

=item read_file

Slurps an entire file and returns the contents of the file as a scalar, or
undef if an error occured (actual error will be in $!).

This function is mean as a light-weight replacement for File::Slurp.

=cut
sub read_file
{
	my $filename = shift 
		or croak("Local::Util::read_file: no file specified");

	# slurp mode
	local $/ = undef;

	# read the file
	open( my $fd, '<', $filename ) or return;
	my $text = <$fd>;
	close( $fd );

	return $text;
}
