=head1 NAME

Local::Inside::DebSrc - extract contents from Debian source package

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Local::Inside::DebSrc;
 my $deb = Local::Inside::DebSrc->new("/path/to/foo_0.1-1.dsc");
 my @list = $deb->list_files();
 my $body = $deb->file_content("debian/control");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module extracts informations and files from a Debian source
package.  It is built upon the C<Local::Inside::Tar> module, see
its documentation for further details on available methods.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=cut

package Local::Inside::DebSrc;

use Local::Inside::Tar;
@ISA = ("Local::Inside::Tar");

use strict;
use Carp;

=item new

This is the constructor.

   my $deb = Local::Inside::DebSrc->new("/path/to/foo_0.1-1.dsc");

Basically, C<dsc> file is parsed to read tarball and patch file
names, then C<Local::Inside::Tar-E<gt>new> is called with tarball
filename being first argument.  When a patch file is found,
C<Local::Inside::Tar-E<gt>bind_patch> method is invoked.
Optional arguments with a C<patch_> prefix are passed along to the
latter (with the prefix removed), whereas other arguments are passed
along to the former.

   my $deb = Local::Inside::DebSrc->new("/path/to/foo_0.1-1.dsc",
        parse_dft => 0,
        patch_parse_dft => -1,
   );

is almost equivalent to

   my $deb = Local::Inside::Tar->new("/path/to/foo_0.1.orig.tar.gz",
        parse_dft => 0,
   );
   $deb->bind_patch( parse_dft => -1 );
   $deb->parse();

=item get_tar_name

Returns the full qualified name of tarball

   my $tarfile = $deb->get_tar_name();

=cut

sub get_tar_name {
        my $self = shift;
        return $self->{name};
}

=item get_diff_name

Returns the full qualified name of the diff file, or empty string if it
does not exist.

   my $patchname = $deb->get_diff_name();

=cut

sub get_diff_name {
        my $self = shift;
        return (defined($self->{patch}) ? $self->{patch}->{name} : '');
}

=back

=head1 LIMITATIONS

It is a pain to retrieve content of Debian packages when in dbs format,
since C<debian/rules> must be called to apply patches on upstream tarball.
It does not make much sense to use an in-memory representation is such a
case, so this module will surely not try to ease parsing such packages.
