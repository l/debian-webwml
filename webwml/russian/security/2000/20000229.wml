<define-tag description>remote exploit in nmh</define-tag>
<define-tag moreinfo>The version of nmh that was distributed in Debian
GNU/Linux 2.1 (aka slink) did not check incoming mail messages properly. This
could be exploited by using carefully designed MIME headers to trick mhshow
into executing arbitrary shell code. This has been fixed in version
0.27-0.28-pre8-4. We recommend you upgrade your nmh package
immediately.</define-tag>
