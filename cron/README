/org/www.debian.org/cron

This directory contains all the scripts used to update the Debian web site.
The updates are started from the crontab of user debwww.

The regular updates are controlled by the file `often', which sets up a
lockfile. It's primary job is simply to execute run-parts on the
parts/ directory. The data files can be found in the datafiles/
directory.

IMPORTANT: if you add a file to parts/, make sure it is before
999TriggerMirrors alphabetically. We want mirroring to be the
last thing done.

The update is started with this crontab (time local to www-master.debian.org
physical location, so Central European Time):
24 3,7,11,15,19,23 * * * /org/www.debian.org/cron/often

The log files for the updates are found in the log/ directory:
  cvs_update.log - output from the cvs update
  wml_run.log    - output from the wml update
  often.log      - everything else

Note: if you want the cvs update to run a bit faster, copy the .cvsignore
file from this directory to ~.

Daily updates are also made, started from the file `lessoften', at 14:49
(local time), and logged to file `lessoften.log' in the log/ directory.
