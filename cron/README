/org/www.debian.org/cron

This directory contains all the scripts used to update the Debian web site.
The updates are currently being started from the crontab of ~joy.

The regular updates are controlled by the file `often', which sets up a
lockfile. It's primary job is simply to execute run-parts on the
parts/ directory. The data files can be found in the datafiles/
directory.

IMPORTANT: if you add a file to parts/, make sure it is before
999TriggerMirrors alphabetically. We want mirroring to be the
last thing done.

The update is started at following (local) times: 4:24, 10:24, 16:24, 22:24.

The log files for the updates are found in:
  cvs_update.log - output from the cvs update
  wml_run.log    - output from the wml update
  often.log      - everything else

Note: if you want the cvs update to run a bit faster, copy the .cvsignore
file from this directory to ~.

Daily updates are also made, started from the file `lessoften', at 15:49
(local time), and logged to file `lessoften.log'.
