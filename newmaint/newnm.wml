<P>Thank you for your interest in Debian, if you would like to be put into
the new maintainer list then enter in the information below.  Before you
apply, you should have a look at the <A href="http://www.debian.org/devel/join/nm-checklist">Applicant's Checklist</A>
 to see what the Application Manager is looking for.  It is a great help if
you can be ready with the information that the checklist asks for
<STRONG>before</STRONG> you apply.
<P>There is a large backlog of applicants which means it may take some time
to get you through the system. To assist applicants coming behind you, 
please try to be prompt in replying to your application manager.  If, at the
moment, outside life is busy and you cannot reply in a timely fashion, then
perhaps you should hold off applying until the workload abates.
<P>Finally remember all Application Managers, Front Desk members and
Developer Accounts Managers are all Debian volunteers with things outside
of new maintainer processing to take up their time.  We are trying to 
be quick, but it helps if you are patient.
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>-- Debian New Maintainer Committee</B>
