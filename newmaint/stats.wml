<H1>Debian New Maintainer - What do these statistics mean?</H1><BR>

<P>There has been some confusion about what the statistics are telling
people, especially some anxious New Maintainers out there.  This page explains
how we generate these numbers and some common questions about them.

<P>The important principle to remember is there is are several stages of
the New Maintainer process. The front page table shows the waiting time
statistic for each stage.  With the exception of <EM>New Maintainers processed
</EM>, which is the total time from application to becoming a new maintainer,
all other times are for that stage only.

<P>By definition, most people will be processed at each stage by the
<EM>Mode</EM>times.  However remember that usually <EM>Median</EM> is larger
and even if you have to wait for that long, you still are progressing
faster than 50% of applicants.

<P>Below is definitions of what the various columns mean.  Remember that
this information is for the past two months from today.  There may be people
who have not yet finished a stage and have waited longer.

<DL>
 <DT>Count</DT><DD>The number of applicants that are at that particular stage.</DD>
 <DT>Mode</DT><DD>The most common waiting time for a stage. The time most people have waited for.
 <DT>Median</DT><DD>The middle entry, if they are were sorted by waiting time. The applicant who waits for median time has half the people going faster than them and half the people going slower than them.</DT>
 <DT>Average</DT><DD>Also called Mean. This is the sum of the waiting times divided by the number of applicants at that stage.</DD>
 <DT>Maximum</DT><DD>The maximum time someone has waited at this stage.</DD>
</DL>
 
<P>As a final word, please compare the various application counts with the
number of application managers.  We are always looking for more Application
Managers to help with the New Maintainer process.
