<h1>Debian New Maintainer Status</h1>

<p>This system is used to display or update the status of New Maintainers
going through the application system.  For more information about the
process itself, look at the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint">New Maintainers' Corner</a>
on our main site.

<h2>Aggregate Statistics</h2>

<p>To give you some idea of the size of the application process and where,
as a whole, applicants are in the system we have provided some overall
statistics.  The waiting times are taken from data for the last two months and
are incremental for each stage except for the 'New Maintainers Processed'
line which is the total time from application to becoming a new maintainer.

<p>If you want to know more, visit the <a href="stats.php">What do these
statistics mean</a> page.
