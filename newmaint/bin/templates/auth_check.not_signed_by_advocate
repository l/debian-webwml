Subject: The message was not signed by the advocate

You tried to approve the application of a New Maintainer (NM) applicant.
However, the message that was sent in was not digitally signed by the
advocate.  While the advocate is "__ADVOCATE__", the message was signed
by "__LDAP_UID__".  The real advocate should send a new GPG signed message.

Thanks.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
