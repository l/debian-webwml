Verifying Mails from Advocates
==============================

An authentication key is sent to the advocate when they enter their
name on the page of an applicant.  The next step step for the advocate
is to reply to the mail and digitally sign it.  The reply goes to
recommend@nm.debian.org and is then piped into the script advocate_check.
This script calls gpgwrapper with various parameters.  gpgwrapper from
userdir-ldap checks the GPG signature.  If the signature is bogus or
there is no signature at all, gpgwrapper generates an error message using
the template templates/auth_check.error-reply.  On the other hand, if
the script was able to verify the GPG signature successfully, it calls
auth_check.  This script tries to mark the advocate check as done and
mails the applicant.   It also generates proper error messages if there
was no authentication key in the message, if there was no applicant
with such an auth key, etc.

In order for this to work, gpgwrapper and userdir_gpg.py from userdir-ldap
(:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/userdir-ldap) need to be installed
in bin/.
