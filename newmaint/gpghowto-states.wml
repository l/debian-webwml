<h2>How to Enter States</h2>

With <i>states</i> we mean administrative divisions of a
country. Depending on the country, these may be federal states,
provinces, regions, territories, etc.
<p>
The general rule is: please use abbreviations of states when these

In particular, please use the following conventions:
