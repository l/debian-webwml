This CVS repository should now be regarded as legacy.  Things are slowly
moving to the new SVN repository at svn+ssh://svn.debian.org/svn/nm/trunk
If you want to make a change, please make it in SVN first, but also
backport it to CVS since klecker:/org/nm.debian.org/ still uses a CVS
checkout (klecker doesn't have SVN).
