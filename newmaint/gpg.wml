#use wml::gpgpage title="GPG Signing Coordination Page"

The key signing coordination page is intended as a service to people
who wish to get involved with the Debian Project, and to Debian members
 who are not yet connected to the web of trust.  Having your
<A href="http://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual.html">GPG</A> key
<A href="http://www.debian.org/events/keysigning">signed</A> by
a Debian member is the preferred way of proving your identity
in the <a href=http://www.debian.org/devel/join/nm-step2>second
step</a> of the <a href=http://www.debian.org/devel/join/newmaint>New
Maintainer process</a>.

Follow these steps in in order to find a Debian member to sign your key:

<ol>

<li>Check the <a href="gpg_offer.php">list of key signing offers</a>
for a Debian member near you.

<li>If you cannot find a Debian member among the key signing offers,
please <a href="gpgregister.php">register your key signing request</a>.

<li>As a last resort, you can send e-mail to gpg-coord@nm.debian.org
telling us where you live exactly (plus naming some big cities close
to you), then we can check in the developer database for developers who
are near you.

</ol>

If you are already a Debian Developer and wish to offer keysigning to
others, please <a href="gpgregister.php">register</a>.  Those interested
in expanding the web of trust beyond Debian should visit <a
href="http://www.biglumber.com/">Biglumber</a>.
