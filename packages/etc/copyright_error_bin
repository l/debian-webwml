There was no copyright file found in this binary package.
This should occour seldomly and either indicates a bug in
the extraction script, a bug in the package or a special
case, like that a link or file is generated by the package
at installation time.

You may try to find the copyright file in other binary packages
build from the same source package.

If you tried that and still think that there is a problem
with the copyright extraction, don't hesitate to file a
bug against the www.debian.org pseudo-package. See
http://www.debian.org/Bugs/ for more information.
