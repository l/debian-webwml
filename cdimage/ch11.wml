#use wml::template::cdimage title="Debian GNU/Linux CD Images"

<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to install Debian GNU/Linux on one computer, and that computer has a free
Internet connection.
<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>- </font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
You don't need to download the CD images at all.
<blockquote>Download the <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-XXXX/</tt> directory
from a Debian FTP mirror (addresses: <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</a>);
substitute the `XXXX' for your architecture, for example `i386' or `alpha'.
This one directory is all you need to get Debian up and running. After
this, your new Debian system can connect directly to a Debian FTP mirror
to automatically fetch and install anything else you need.
<p>The CDs contain vast amounts of programs that you won't use at all.
The procedure described above will thus save you lots of download time
(i.e. you can start installing much earlier) and will also reduce the strain
on our heavily loaded FTP servers. Another advantage is that, using this
method, your system can be upgraded automatically when new packages arrive
on the FTP sites (you don't have to wait for a new CD).</blockquote>
