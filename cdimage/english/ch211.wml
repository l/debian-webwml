<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to install Debian GNU/Linux on many interconnected computers that have
a free Internet connection.

<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>-</font></font>
<u>Solution:</u></b> You don't need to download the CD images at all.

<blockquote>
If you have enough disk space, you should set up a private Debian
packages mirror. This means that you copy the appropriate
directories from one of our mirrors (addresses: <a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</a>)
to one of the computers in your network. Please refer to <a
href="http://www.debian.org/mirror/">http://www.debian.org/mirror</a>
for more information.

<p>
If you don't have enough disk space, just use one of our mirrors
(addresses: <a
href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</a>),
or use the Proxy Trick (see below).

<p>
Either way, the computers you want to install Debian on only need
the files from the <tt>/dists/stable/main/disks-XXXX/</tt> directory
from the chosen Debian packages mirror (substitute the `XXXX' for
your architecture, for example `i386' or `alpha') to install a small
`base system'. After this, all Debian systems can connect directly
to the mirror to automatically fetch and install anything else you
need.

<p>
<b><u>The Proxy Trick:</u></b> An alternative to mirroring is to
use a caching HTTP proxy.  Configure the proxy to keep *.deb files
for a long time, then set http_proxy in your environment on each
machine to point at the cache, and use apt's HTTP aquisition method.

<p>
This gives you most of the benefit of running a mirror, with none of
the admin hassle.  Since you can set limits on the proxy's disk
usage, this can provide benefits even for sites with fairly limited
disk space, and it has the advantage over mirroring that you only
download those packages you install, which saves bandwidth.

<p>Squid can be told to keep the files by adding a line to
/etc/squid.conf:
<pre>
refresh_pattern   debian.org/.*.deb$   129600 100% 129600
</pre>
