<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to install Debian GNU/Linux on many interconnected computers. One of the
accessible Internet-connected computers is running Linux, another UNIX
variant, or Windows 95/98/NT.
<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>- </font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
You can download the CD images using the Pseudo-Image Kit.
<blockquote>The latest version of the Pseudo-Image Kit is available from
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit</a>.
There are versions for UNIX (incl. Linux) and Windows 95/98/NT. This is
an easy-to-use set of programs that will construct a `pseudo' CD image
from data that is downloaded automatically from one of the Debian FTP mirrors
(addresses: <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist</a>)
or from a local disk. After this, binary patching is used to convert the
pseudo-image to the Offical Image. This is done with the `rsync' program,
using one of the Debian CD rsync mirrors (addresses: <a href="rsync-mirrors">http://cdimage.debian.org/rsync-mirrors</a>).
The README file in the Pseudo-Image Kit contains extensive information
about the procedure.
<p>The Pseudo-Image Kit uses a Debian package mirror (maybe you're running
one yourself) to create the largest part of the CD image. There are many
fast Debian package mirrors, so this procedure is not only fast, but also
greatly lightens the load on the CD image mirrors, of which there are only
few. The network traffic to/from the CD image mirror is typically under
6 MB (1% of the size of a CD image).
<p>Once you have acquired the CDs, it might be worth the time of setting
up a local Debian packages mirror by making the contents of the CDs available
for local FTP. Computers running the small Debian `base system' can then
connect directly to the local FTP server to automatically fetch and install
all software you need.

Questions</a>.</blockquote>
