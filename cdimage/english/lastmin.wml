<h2>Last-minute Notes</h2>

<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> This page
contains some last-minute information regarding the official
<a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian</a>
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/">CD images</a>.

<ul>

<li><b>Official Potato 2.2 rev2 series</b>
<ul>
<li>Not all packages from section `contrib' are included on the CDs,
since they depend on non-free packages that are also not on the CDs.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>The problems with the <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode mouse driver have still
not been resolved. See in the `2.2 rev0' section below for more info.

<li><b>Official Potato 2.2 rev0 series</b>
<ul>
<li>Not all packages from section `contrib' are included on the CDs,

<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>
I386: There are some issues with the <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode mouse driver
while running the X Window System. The easiest solution is to remove the line
<tt>repeat_type=&lt;something&gt;</tt>
from <tt>/etc/gpm.conf</tt>, running "<tt>/etc/init.d/gpm restart</tt>"
and then restart X. Other solutions are possible, ask the
<a href="mailto:gpm@packages.debian.org">gpm maintainer</a> to supply
more documentation.
<br>&nbsp;</li>

<li>I386: The previously available Binary-2 CD image had a one-bit problem
that prevented the package `<tt>pdksh</tt>' from being installed. A repaired
image of this CD is (slowly) propagating to the mirrors - but repairing
your own image is very easy with the
<a href="/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.c">correct-i386-2.c</a>
program.
<br>
Thanks to <a href="mailto:kteague@sprocket.dhis.net">Ken Teague</a>
we also have a precompiled
<a href="/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.zip">Windows version</a>; usage:
extract the <tt>.zip</tt> in the dir where the <tt>binary-i386-2.iso</tt>
file is sitting, then in a DOS box change to that directory and give the
command "<tt>correct-i386-2 binary-i386-2.iso</tt>".
<br>
If you have a CD-ROM, which you obviously cannot repair, the easiest
option to get <tt>pdksh</tt> is to
<a href="http://ftp.debian.org/debian/dists/potato/main/binary-i386/shells/pdksh_5.2.14-1.deb">download
it</a> (212 kB) and install with "<tt>dpkg -i pdksh_5.2.14-1.deb</tt>".
But you can also copy the file from the CD to a temporary directory and
use the same
<a href="/~costar/correct_cds/correct-i386-2.c">correct-i386-2.c</a>
program, but then you should modify it so that <tt>POS</tt>
is <tt>0x64de</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>POWERPC: The powerpc Binary-1_NONUS and Binary-3 CD images are
also plagued by a one-bit problem, preventing `<tt>smbfs</tt>' and
`<tt>gimp-manual</tt>' respectively from being installed.
Repaired versions are (slowly) propagating to the mirrors, but you
can repair your own images very easily with the
<a href="/~costar/correct_cds/correct-powerpc-1_NONUS.c">correct-powerpc-1_NONUS.c</a>
and
<a href="/~costar/correct_cds/correct-powerpc-3.c">correct-powerpc-3.c</a>
programs. These also contain information on repairing the affected packages
individually when copied from CD (which is especially useful for the
15MB-sized `<tt>gimp-manual</tt>').
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>SPARC: The 2.2 rev0 CDs have a problem when booting from the
Binary-1 CD. This has been solved in the 2.2 rev0a (or 2.2_rev0_CDa) version
of the sparc CDs.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>SPARC: If X doesn't start correctly, and the error message mentions
the mouse, and you're <i>not</i> running the <tt>gpm</tt>
text-mode mouse driver, &quot;<tt>rm -f /dev/gpmdata</tt>&quot;
might help.
<br>&nbsp;</li>
<li>ALPHA: The 2.2 rev0 CDs may prove problematic when booting from the
Binary-1 CD. To solve that, boot with `<tt>-flags i</tt>', then enter at
the aboot prompt:
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;aboot&gt; b /linux initrd=/boot/root.bin
root=/dev/ram</tt>
<br>
This problem has been corrected in the 2.2 rev0a (or 2.2_rev0_CDa) version of
the alpha CDs.

<li><b>Potato test-cycle-3 series</b>
<ul>
<li>The <tt>gpm</tt> text-mode mouse driver has some problems. You should
<u>not</u> run the <tt>mouse-test</tt> program, and you'll have to
do "<tt>/etc/init.d/gpm stop</tt>" before you can use the mouse in X.
