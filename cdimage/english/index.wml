Debian GNU/Linux 2.2 revision 2 has been
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-announce-00/msg00014.html">released</a>.
Updated CD images have been made, and are slowly propagating to our
mirrors (mirroring 18 GB does take some time).
<p>
NOTE: if CD images are NOT in a <tt>2.2_rev2</tt> directory,
they are NOT the latest Official Potato images!
<p>
Before downloading, please read the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a>.
Also the <a href="lastmin.html">Last-Minute Notes</a> provide some
useful information.

The problems with the generation of 2.1r5 images are &quot;about&quot;
to be resolved. However, since several things have changed since the
official 'FTP'-release of r5, no r5 CD images will be made; we'll be
heading for r6 instead.

<p>
If you are interested, there are some unofficial CD images of
"woody" (the current Debian development version, to be released as
2.3 or maybe 3.0 in due time) for
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0010/msg00018.html">linux-i386
binary</a> and of "sid" (the even more unstable development version) for
<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0010/msg00030.html">hurd-i386
binary</a>
(<a href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0011/msg00092.html">new</a>/<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0012/msg00000.html">2</a>/<a
href="http://lists.debian.org/debian-cd-0012/msg00001.html">3</a>).
Also available there is an unofficial "potato" linux-i386
"extra" CD with security updates, non-free, KDE, KDE2, Helix Gnome
and some other programs.
