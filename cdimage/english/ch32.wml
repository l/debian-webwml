<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to burn/press numerous customized CDs to sell/give away.
<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>- </font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
You should use the Debian CD creation script.
A `released' version is packaged as
&quot;<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/unstable/admin/debian-cd.html">debian-cd</a>&quot;,
but the best results are usually obtained by using the latest version
from CVS.

<blockquote>
To get the latest CVS version, make sure you have
<a href="http://packages.debian.org/stable/devel/cvs.html">cvs</a>
installed. From an empty directory give the following commands:
<pre>
$ export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@cvs.debian.org:/cvs/debian-boot
$ cvs login
[empty password]
$ cvs checkout -AP debian-cd
$ cvs logout
</pre>


<p>
With this script, you can generate customized Debian CDs
easily. For this, you need a Linux computer with much disk space.
<p><b><i>Do not</i></b> try to make Debian CDs by copying the Debian FTP
site to a CD using a commercial CD burning program. This most certainly
<b><i>will
not work</i></b>, because Debian needs a very special directory structure
that these programs do not provide. Also, you won't be able to boot from
these CDs. If you have no other option, please consider distributing the
Official CDs instead.
<p>You should also read the <a href="faq.html">CD Image Frequently Asked
Questions</a>.</blockquote>
