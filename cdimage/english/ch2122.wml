<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to install Debian GNU/Linux on many interconnected computers. You don't
have free Internet access at all.
<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>- </font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
You should buy a CD from one of the Debian CD vendors. Addresses are on
<a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors</a>.
<blockquote>Debian CDs are usually much cheaper than your downloading costs.
So this solution will not only save you lots of download time and trouble,
but also quite some money.
<p>Once you have acquired the CDs, it might be worth the time of setting
up a local Debian packages mirror by making the contents of the CDs available
for local FTP. Computers running the small Debian `base system' can then
connect directly to the local FTP&nbsp;server to automatically fetch and
install all software you need.</blockquote>
