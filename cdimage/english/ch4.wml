<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to become a Debian CD Image mirror site.

for this.</blockquote>

</font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
Getting the images and making them accessible is possible in several ways,
depending on your possibilities.

<ul>You should <i>not</i> use FTP or HTTP to get the images. These
transfers have a high failing probability because of the enourmous size of
the files. Moreover, if the images change only slightly (as is the case
with subreleases), they would be downloaded entirely all over again. This
puts a high stress on our computers and network connections.

<p>For these reasons, we use the `<tt>rsync</tt>' program that is essentially
doing remote binary patching. With <tt>rsync</tt>, subrelease images are
updated very efficiently, as only the changed parts are transferred over
the network; the unchanged parts are copied from the old image.

<p><tt>Rsync</tt> alone still does full downloads for `all new' releases,
as those images contain virtually no unchanged parts. However, with the
Pseudo-Image Kit we can create `pseudo' CD images from data that is available
already on the nearest Debian FTP mirror -- maybe on your own local harddisk.
Then <tt>rsync</tt> can binary patch these `pseudo-images' to the official
ones. And even for most subrelease images this is found to be more efficient
than patching the old image.

<p>The Pseudo-Image Kit is designed mainly for downloading only one or
a few images, like most people do. There is also the `<tt>debcdmirror</tt>'
script which makes mirroring <i>really</i> easy because it automatically
uses the Pseudo-Image Kit and <tt>rsync</tt> to keep your mirror up to
date -- even to the point of automatically MD5-checksumming every downloaded
image. With <tt>debcdmirror</tt>, you can also specify exactly what you
want to mirror.

<p>So we have the following possibilities for getting the images and keeping
them up to date:

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
By FTP&nbsp;or HTTP</li>

<dd>
This should <i>not</i> be done.</dd>

<li>
By using only <tt>rsync</tt> (daily cron job)</li>

<dd>
This is preferable only on sites that don't have a nearby/fast Debian FTP
mirror.</dd>

<li>
By using the Pseudo-Image Kit manually (maybe with <tt>rsync</tt> to update
subreleases)</li>

<dd>
Lots of work and lots of trouble.</dd>

<li>
By using the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script (which "internally" uses the Pseudo-Image
Kit and <tt>rsync</tt>) (daily cron job)</li>

<dd>
<b>This</b> is what you should do!</dd>
</ul>

<p><br>The latest version of the Pseudo-Image Kit is available from
<a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit/">http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/pseudo-image-kit</a>.
; the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script is available at <a href="http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/debcdmirror/">http://cdimage.debian.org/~costar/debcdmirror</a>.
Read the README's in both packages for extensive information about the
procedures.

<p><b>Note 1:</b>&nbsp;For the <tt>debcdmirror</tt> script, you must choose
an <tt>rsync</tt> mirror that offers an `<tt>ls-lR</tt>' file. Addresses are on
<a href="rsync-mirrors">http://cdimage.debian.org/rsync-mirrors</a>.
Official public mirrors are allowed to rsync directly from the master
server, cdimage.debian.org;
you probably need a password for that one, ask
<a href="mailto:phil@hands.com">the maintainer</a>.
<p>
If you don't have a local &quot;regular&quot; Debian FTP mirror, check the
<a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/ftplist">list of FTP sites</a>.
<p>
<tt>debcdmirror</tt> requires <tt>bash</tt> version 2 or higher.
If necessary you can install that in a non-default location, but then be sure
to update the path to <tt>bash</tt> in the first line of the script.

<p><b>Note 2:</b> If you use <tt>rsync</tt> only, use at least
the options <b><tt>--times --links --hard-links --block-size=8192</tt></b>.
This will preserve modification time, symlinks and hardlinks, and use a
block size of 8192 bytes (most efficient for CD&nbsp;images). When modification
time and size are the same, <tt>rsync</tt> will just leave the file alone,
so <tt>--times</tt> is really obligatory.

<p><b>Note 3:</b> The `<tt><i>codename</i>_test</tt>' directory contains
images that are hard-linked to the ones in the versioned (e.g. <tt>2.1_r3</tt>)
directories. The versioned directory name will change between (sub)releases,
but the names in the `<tt>test</tt>' directories will stay the same. So,
in the <tt>rsync</tt>-only situation, mirroring both the versioned and
the appropriate `<tt>test</tt>' directories, <i>and</i> using the <tt>--hard-links</tt>
option is the only way for rsync to update subreleases properly. [You should
<i>not</i> include `<tt>test</tt>' directories with <tt>debcdmirror</tt>,
because <tt>debcdmirror</tt> will handle things differently and more
efficiently.]

<p><b>Note 4:</b> The <tt>ls-lR</tt> file describes the directory
structure of the mirror it is on.
<b><i>DO NOT</i></b> mirror the <tt>ls-lR</tt> file; either make one yourself
(with the provided `<tt>Makels-lR</tt>', every hour via <tt>cron</tt>)
or simply have <i>no</i> <tt>ls-lR</tt>
file at all. [<tt>debcdmirror</tt> will create a local <tt>ls-lR</tt>
automatically after mirroring.]
<br>&nbsp;

<p>Once you have acquired the CD images you want to mirror (i386 and Source
CDs are most popular), you should run the <tt>rsync</tt> server program.
This will not place a heavy load on your machine, and will generate much
less network traffic than an FTP/HTTP service. Instructions for setting
this up are in the README of the Pseudo-Image Kit.
<p>Of course, if you don't have problems with many gigabytes of network
traffic per day, we'd very much appreciate another FTP/HTTP mirror. We'll
be happy with everything you can afford.
<p>Please notify <a href="mailto:debian-cd@lists.debian.org">debian-cd@lists.debian.org</a>
that you are running a mirror, so that we can update the appropriate pages.
Thanks in advance!

Image Frequently Asked Questions</a>.</blockquote>
