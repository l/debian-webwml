#use wml::template::cdimage title="Debian GNU/Linux CD Images"

<p><b><font color="#3333FF"><font size=+2>->-</font></font></b> You want
to install Debian GNU/Linux on many computers. None of the accessible Internet-connected
computers is running Linux, another UNIX variant, or Windows 95/98/NT.
<p><b><font color="#00E100"><font size=+2>-<i>!</i>- </font></font><u>Solution:</u></b>
You can download the CD images from one of the FTP or HTTP servers.
<blockquote>Please use the nearest mirror for downloading the images. Addresses
are on <a href="ftp-mirrors.html">http://cdimage.debian.org/ftp-mirrors.html</a>.
<b><i>Please
wait</i></b> a few days after the images are released, before starting
to download them. After our previous release, one of the mirrors generated
so much traffic that it was taken off-line for a few days by angry network
operators. We ask you to help us avoiding this. If your FTP/HTTP download
fails somehow, <b><i>please do not re-try immediately</i></b>, but wait
a few days. Our logs show large numbers of downloads from far locations
that fail continuously. In such a case, <b><i>please stop downloading</i></b>
the images and buy a (really cheap) CD from one of the Debian CD vendors
(addresses on <a href="http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors">http://www.debian.org/distrib/vendors</a>).
<p>You should also read the <a href="faq.html">CD Image Frequently Asked
Questions</a>.</blockquote>
