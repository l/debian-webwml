<h3>SSH Host Keys</h3>

<p>The SSH host keys for the machines in the debian.org domains are
stored in the Debian LDAP database.  The key and its fingerprint will
be displayed when <a href="machines.cgi">details</a> for a machine are
displayed.</p>

<p>On machines in the debian.org which are updated from the LDAP
database <code>/etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts</code> contains the keys for
all hosts in this domain.  This helps for easier log in into such a
machine.  This is also be available in the chroot environments.</p>

<p>Developers should add <code>StrictHostKeyChecking yes</code> to
their <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file so that they only connect to
trusted hosts.  With the file mentioned above, nearly all hosts in the
debian.org domain will be trusted automatically.</p>

<p>Developers can also execute <code>ud-host -f</code> or
<code>ud-host -f -h host</code> on a machine in the debian.org domain
in order to display all host fingerprints or only the fingerprints of
a particular host in order to compare it with the output of
<code>ssh</code> on an external host.</p>

<h3>Exception for Alioth</h3>

<p>An exception has been made for the Alioth system since not only
Debian developers have an account on this machine.  As a result, this
machine (or machines in case there are more of one serving as Alioth
hosts) is generally not trusted.  Hence no passwords (i.e. no shadow
file(s)) will be exported to it and their SSH keys are not added to
the LDAP system.</p>
