#use wml::debian::template title="Email Forwarding"
<p>
Emails to @debian.org now go through a LDAP distributed email system. This
system uses the forwarding field in the LDAP directory to route mail without
passing it through a users .forward/.qmail file on a single computer.
Multiple machines participate in the forwarding to provide redudency.

<p>
The system is very simple, each of the forwarders inspects the ldap database
to see if foo@debian.org has fowarding set to an address, if so the envelope
address to is rewritten and the message redirected to that address.
Otherwise the message is relayed to master.debian.org for processing by the
users .qmail files. If email forwarding is setup then .qmail files are
<b>NOT</b> considered. Extension addresses (foo-lists) are always routed
directly to master for processing.

<p>
All machines also use the forwarding attribute as a default destination for
email. If the user has a home directory and no .forward file the mail is
forwarded rather than delivered to /var/spool/mail. This makes sure cron
reports, bug responses and other unexpected emails are not lost.

<p>
The email forwarding can be easially reconfigured using GnuPG:
<pre>
echo "emailfoward: foo@bar.com" | gpg --clearsign | mail change@db.debian.org
</pre>
or by visiting <a href="https://db.debian.org/login.html">db.debian.org/</a>
