<p>
If you have lost or forgotten your LDAP password (and by extension, your
machine login password) you can have it reset by sending a PGP signed 
message to the <a href="doc-mail.html">mail gateway</a>:
<pre>
echo "Please change my Debian password" | gpg --clearsign | mail chpasswd@db.debian.org
or
echo "Please change my Debian password" | pgp -fast | mail chpasswd@db.debian.org
</pre>
The daemon will then respond with a new randomized password encrypted
with your key. You can then use the 
<a href="https://db.debian.org/login.html">SSL Web pages</a> to change your
password to something you can remember. You cannot set a new password via the
mail gateway.

<p>
Alternatively, you can do without a password and use PGP to manipulate your
LDAP information through the <a href="doc-mail.html">mail gateway</a> and use
SSH RSA Authentication to access the servers. To setup OpenSSH for RSA you
need to first generate a private RSA key using <tt>ssh-keygen</tt> and select
a good passphrase for it. Then send the public portion of the key to the LDAP
directory:
<pre>
gpg --clearsign < ~/.ssh/identity.pub | mail change@db.debian.org
</pre>
You can then use this key to authenticate to the machines. Using ssh-agent 
(automatically run by Debian's X configuration) you can use ssh-add to 'cache'
your passphrase once.
