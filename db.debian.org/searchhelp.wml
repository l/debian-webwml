To look up information about Debian developers, enter your search criteria
in the form. Results are returned which match all of the search criteria.
Wildcards may be used. For example, entering <code>*de*</code> in the last name
field will return all developers whose surname contains the substring
<code>de</code>. Matches are case-insensitive, and all searching criteria that
are left empty will be ignored. Selecting the "fuzzy search" option will turn 
on approximate searching.<p>

The "On vacation" field will return all developers who have left a vacation
message.<p>
