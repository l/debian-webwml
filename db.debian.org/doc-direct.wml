#use wml::db.d.o title="Direct LDAP Access"

<p>
The LDAP utilities package provides a program called ldapsearch that can be
used to execute direct queries to the database. Generally this is done by
putting
<pre>
HOST db.debian.org
BASE dc=debian,dc=org
</pre>
in ~/.ldaprc. Then queries can be performed, for instance
<pre>
samosa{jgg}~#ldapsearch uid=wakkerma keyfingerprint
uid=wakkerma,ou=users,dc=debian,dc=org
keyfingerprint=38444C2CA6AD756EB4A2E5FA612AFF59
keyfingerprint=576E100B518D2F1636B028053CB892502FA3BC2D
</pre>
Shows the PGP key finger prints for the <tt>wakkerma</tt> user. The first word
in the command is the query to perform, the rest of command line are the 
attributes to return, if omitted then all readable attributes are returned. 
More complicated queries are possible, for instance:
<pre>
samosa{jgg}~#ldapsearch '(&(!(loginshell=/bin/bash))(uid=*))' loginshell
uid=admin,ou=users,dc=debian,dc=org

uid=mryan,ou=users,dc=debian,dc=org
loginshell=/usr/bin/tcsh

uid=jkominek,ou=users,dc=debian,dc=org
loginshell=/usr/bin/zsh

uid=caelum,ou=users,dc=debian,dc=org
loginshell=/usr/bin/zsh
[..]
</pre>
Shows users that do not use bash as their shell. Some other interesting
queries are:
<ul>
<li>Count the number of developers <tt>(&(keyfingerprint=*)(gidnumber=800))</tt>
<li>Show people in a certain group <tt>gidmembership=adm</tt>
<li>People named james <tt>cn=james</tt>
<li>Someone whos last name phonetically sounds like 'Ackerma' <tt>sn~=ackerm</tt>
<li>All the sparcs <tt>host=sparc</tt>
</ul>

has more information about the filter expressions.

<h1>Other LDAP Browsers</h1>
<p>
The GQ package has a graphical LDAP browser that can browse the debian.org
tree. It is somewhat ungainly with the large number of entries in our
directory, but it does work nonetheless. Configuration is similar, use the
preferences dialog to add a new host with the information given above.
<p>
Netscape has a browser for their mailer, but I have never been able to get
it to work, please email if you have any luck.
<p>
To my knowledge there are no interfaces for popular mailers like mutt and
gnus. Such an interface would allow using the directory as an enhanced address
book.
